{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0
