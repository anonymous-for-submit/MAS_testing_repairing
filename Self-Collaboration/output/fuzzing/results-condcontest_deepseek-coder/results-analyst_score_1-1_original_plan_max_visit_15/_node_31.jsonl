Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m where each cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move: a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). Every time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2, and Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns. Determine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively.

He was given math homework in which he was given an array a of length n and an array of symbols b of length n, consisting of symbols '*' and '/'.\n\nLet's denote a path of calculations for a segment [l; r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) in the following way: \n\n  * Let x=1 initially. For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i, and if b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations (the number of them is exactly r - l + 1). \n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number! Ensure your program efficiently processes arrays with lengths up to 100.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe third line contains n symbols without spaces between them \u2014 the array b_1, b_2 \u2026 b_n (b_i= '/' or b_i= '*' for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264

The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable, and then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements so Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k. Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the

any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is

To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nCalculate the amount of time required to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

The keys are organized consecutively in one row in a specific sequence. Each key corresponds to a letter of the Latin alphabet in lowercase form. \n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). During pressing the keys, there is no time spent. Similarly, no time is incurred while your hand is placed over the first letter of the word. \n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nCalculate the amount of time required to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

The grid is a two-dimensional structure defined by two parameters n and m. There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m.

You have to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5]. This sequence has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n7\n1 3 4 2 2 1 5\n3\n1 3 4\n5\n1 3 2 4 2\n4\n4 3 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, YouKn0wWho can split the sequence in the following way: [1, 3, 4], [2, 2], [1, 5]. This way, the LIS lengths are h = [3, 1, 2], and the bitwise XOR of the LIS lengths is 3 \u2295 1 \u2295 2 = 0.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to split the sequence into subarrays that will satisfy the condition.", "completions": ["def read_ints():\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ndef lis_length(arr):\n    dp = [1] * len(arr)\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    return max(dp)\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = read_ints()\n        \n        # Try all possible splits\n        possible = False\n        for mask in range(1, 1 << (n -
