{"task_id": "HumanEval/87", "prompt": "def get_row(lst, x):\t\n'''You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists, which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices, each row may contain a different number of columns. Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0. Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
