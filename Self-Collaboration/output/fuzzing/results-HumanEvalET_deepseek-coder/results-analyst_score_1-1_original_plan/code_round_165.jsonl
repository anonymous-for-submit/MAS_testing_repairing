Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0. Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order. Ensure that the resulting list of coordinates is comprehensive and doesn't skip any occurrences of x in the dataset.\nExamples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n
