'''We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The

    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index.

The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

This function outputs the number of such collisions. Assume that all cars are point-sized, making it easier to calculate collisions.
