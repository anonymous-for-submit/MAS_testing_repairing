- Each string in the list can have between 0 to 1000 characters.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** ["Go", "Bearcats"]
   **Output:** "GoBearcats"
   
2. **Input:** ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
   **Output:** "abcd"
   
3. **Input:** []
   **Output:** ""

Write efficient code to handle edge cases such as empty strings and empty lists.

'''We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times. One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction, with the last element of the array moving to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, and the conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is [1]. 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.
For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

'''Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    The solution should also account for reducing the fraction to its simplest form before evaluation.
