{"name": "1600_J. Robot Factory", "description": "You have received data from a Bubble bot. You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct. \n\nYour task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.

You understand your mission is to create factory facilities, but before you initiate, you need information about the size of the factory and the total number of rooms it contains. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is a rectangle shape: N x M.\n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers, which represent factory tiles and can range from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked at in its binary form because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example, number 10 in its binary form is 1010, so it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side, and it doesn't have a wall on the West side.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on its edges.
