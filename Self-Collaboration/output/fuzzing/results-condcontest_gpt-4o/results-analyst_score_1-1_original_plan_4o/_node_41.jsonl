{"index": 56, "parent": 2, "child": [], "score": true, "passes": 6, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "prompt": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions. The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them, allowing travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate; to travel from the x-th room to the y-th room requires a tunnel between x and y, consuming max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 -

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you substitute the segment a[l \u2026 r] with its cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "completions": ["def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_chars = set(s)\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in unique_chars:\n        filtered_string = [c for c in s if c != char]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered_string):\n            deletions = len(s) -

For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i. If b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations. The number of them is exactly r - l + 1. \n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer

Call a cell in this grid exitable if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself. Therefore, all filled in cells are not exitable because they do not allow exit through empty cells. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ...

E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    .

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it. Additionally, it has an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled. If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle. That way, he can guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

There are 10^9+7 cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once. Additionally, he provided Q queries that you need to answer about the connections. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from L_{i} to R_{i} on that list using only roads of length D_{i}. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and Q (1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 2\u22c510^5 ) \u2014 the length of the array of cities and the number of queries you need to answer. \n\nThe second lines contains N integers representing the array of cites. Next Q lines contain three integers L, R and D (1 \u2264 L_{i}, R_{i} \u2264 N, 0 \u2264 D_{i} \u2264 10^9+6) \u2014 the range of cities that needs to be connected and the length of the road that you can use. \n\nOutput\n\nThe output contains Q lines.

On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them).

The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i.

You understand your mission is to create factory facilities, but before you initiate, you need information about the size of the factory and the total number of rooms it contains. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct. \n\nYour task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.

Now he will split the sequence a into one or more consecutive subarrays so that each element of a belongs to exactly one subarray. Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Consider edge cases where some subsequences could be empty.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the resulting string s with \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nb\naabbbabaa\nbbbb\nabbaaa\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.\n\nIn the second test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. \n\nIn the third test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.\n\nIn the fourth test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.", "completions": ["def balance_ab_ba(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for s in test_cases:\n        ab_count = 0\n        ba_count = 0\n        \n        # Count occurrences of 'ab' and 'ba'\n        for i in range(len(s) -

The rows on the board are numbered from top to bottom starting at 1, while columns are numbered from left to right beginning at 1.\n\nThe robot is capable of moving from its current position to any of the four adjacent cells.\n\nThe robot follows a given sequence of commands, denoted by the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D', or 'U', which correspond to movements to the left, right, down, or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot is free to begin its journey from any cell. It follows the commands in the exact order they are presented in the sequence s. Moving off the board results in the robot falling and breaking, and such a command isn't counted as successful.\n\nThe goal for the robot is to carry out as many commands as it can without falling off the board. For instance, on a 3 \u00d7 3 board, if the robot begins the sequence s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the center, it will execute one command, but the next will make it cross the edge. Starting from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column), the robot will execute all commands and finish at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves to the right twice, down, left, and up twice. In this situation, it concludes at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFigure out the starting cell for the robot to maximize the execution of commands without going off the board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2", "completions": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        #

In this game, his character must defeat a dragon. The fight with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is executed at the start of the a_i-th second from the beginning of the battle. The dagger doesn't inflict damage directly, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which causes 1 damage in each of the following k seconds (starting from the same second when the dragon was injected with poison). However, if the dragon is already under the poison's effects, the dagger refreshes the poison effect (meaning it cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor instance, assume k = 4, and Monocarp strikes the dragon at seconds 2, 4 and 10. Therefore, the poison effect begins at the start of the 2-nd second and causes 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; subsequently, at the start of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, resulting in exactly 1 damage during seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is activated again, dealing 1 damage during seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. Thus, the dragon receives 10 damage in total.\n\nMonocarp understands that the dragon has h hit points, and if he causes at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he defeats the dragon. Monocarp is undecided about the potency of the poison to use in the battle, so he seeks to determine the smallest possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect persists) that suffices to inflict no less than h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64

You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. This operation allows you to balance out the heights. Trading blocks can help achieve a more uniform look.\n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3.
