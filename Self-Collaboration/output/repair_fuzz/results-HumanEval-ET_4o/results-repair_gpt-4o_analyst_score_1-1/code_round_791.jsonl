Ensure your solution handles both uppercase and lowercase inputs effectively.'''\n\n    # Define a list of planets ordered by their proximity to the sun\n    planets = [\"mercury\", \"venus\", \"earth\", \"mars\", \"jupiter\", \"saturn\", \"uranus\", \"neptune\"]\n\n    # Normalize the input to handle case-insensitivity\n    planet1 = planet1.lower()\n    planet2 = planet2.lower()\n\n    # Validate the input planet names against the list of known planets\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n\n    # Find the index positions of planet1 and planet2 in the list\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n\n    # Extract the planets between the two index positions\n    if index1 < index2:\n        result = planets[index1 + 1:index2]\n    else:\n        result = planets[index2 + 1:index1]\n\n    # Return the sorted planets as a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Validate the input planet names.\",\n      \"details\": \"Check if both planet1 and planet2 are valid planet names from the list of eight planets.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Normalize the input.\",\n      \"details\": \"Convert planet1 and planet2 to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify the positions of the planets.\",\n      \"details\": \"Determine the index positions of planet1 and planet2 in the ordered list of planets.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Extract planets between the two given planets.\",\n      \"details\": \"Using the index positions, extract the planets that are located between planet1 and planet2.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Sort the extracted planets by proximity to the sun.\",\n      \"details\": \"Ensure the extracted planets are sorted in order of their proximity to the sun.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Return the result.\",\n      \"details\": \"Return the extracted and sorted planets as a tuple.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Define a list of planets ordered by their proximity to the sun.\",\n    \"Validate the input planet names against the list of planets.\",\n    \"Normalize the input to handle case insensitivity.\",\n    \"Find the index positions of the input planets in the list.\",\n    \"Extract the planets between the two indices.\",\n    \"Sort the extracted planets by their order in the list.\",\n    \"Return the sorted planets as a tuple.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'planet names': These are the names of the planets in our solar system.
