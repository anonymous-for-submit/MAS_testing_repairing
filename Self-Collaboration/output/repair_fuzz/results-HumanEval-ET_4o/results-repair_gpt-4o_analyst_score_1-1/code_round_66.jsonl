{"task_id": "HumanEval/73", "prompt": "def smallest_change(arr):\t\n'''Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards. An array is said to be palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
