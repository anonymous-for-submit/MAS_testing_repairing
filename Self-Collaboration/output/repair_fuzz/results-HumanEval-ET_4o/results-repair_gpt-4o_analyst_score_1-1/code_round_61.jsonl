{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes, your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value. Even values are those which can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index. \n\nThe plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ], If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\nExample 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\n
