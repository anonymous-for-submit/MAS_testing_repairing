concept]\n    'odd indices'\n    Explanation: Odd indices refer to the positions in the list that have an odd index number, starting from 1.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The step 2-4 should be implemented simultaneously:\n    \"Filter the elements of the list that are located at these odd indices.\"\n    \"Check if the filtered elements are even numbers.\"\n    \"Sum the even numbers from the filtered list.\"\n    This can be achieved by iterating over the list, checking if the index is odd, then checking if the element at that index is even, and summing it up.\n\n# [edge case] \n    add([1, 3, 5, 7]) = 0\n    Explanation: Since all elements are at odd indices, and there are no even numbers, the sum of even numbers at odd indices is 0.\n    add([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are at even indices, so there are no even numbers at odd indices, resulting in a sum of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
