{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that contains the odd numbers in the collatz sequence.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the earlier term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nNote: \n1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only
