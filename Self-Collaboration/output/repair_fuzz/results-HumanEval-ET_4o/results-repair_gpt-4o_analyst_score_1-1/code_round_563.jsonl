Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), sorted initially by rows in ascending and by columns of the row in descending order.\nExamples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    get_row([], 1) == []\n    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n    '''\n```"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 410}
