A palindromic array is an array that\n    reads the same both backwards and forwards. It must have the characteristic of symmetry when read from either end. In one change, you can change one element to any other element. Aim to achieve the least number of changes while transforming the array into a palindrome.\n    For example:\n        smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n        smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n        smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n    changes = 0\n    start = 0\n    end = len(arr) - 1\n    \n    while start < end:\n        if arr[start] != arr[end]:\n            changes += 1\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n    \n    return changes\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 191, "repair_prompt": ["def smallest_change(arr):\t\n'''    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
