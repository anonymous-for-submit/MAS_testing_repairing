Return the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. Otherwise return -1. Three sides make a valid triangle if one condition is met. This condition is that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This condition is critical. Without it, the sides will not form a triangle.\nExample:\n    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00\n    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1\n    '''", "def triangle_area(a, b, c):\t\n'''Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
