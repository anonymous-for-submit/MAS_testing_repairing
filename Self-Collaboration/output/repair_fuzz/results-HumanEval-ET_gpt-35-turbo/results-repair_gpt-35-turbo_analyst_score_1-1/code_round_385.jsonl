{"task_id": "HumanEval/106", "prompt": "def f(n):\t\n'''Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter, and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. For odd i, you should compute the sum of numbers from 1 to i. i starts from 1. The factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\nExample:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    '''", "test": ["def check(f):\n\tassert f(15) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(24) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(2) == [1, 2]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(10) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(21) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(27) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325, 403291461126605635584000000, 378]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(4) == [1, 2, 6, 24]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(16) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(8) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(25) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(3) == [1, 2, 6]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(29) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325, 403291461126605635584000000, 378, 304888344611713860501504000000, 435]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(30) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325, 403291461126605635584000000, 378, 304888344611713860501504000000, 435, 265252859812191058636308480000000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(18) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(12) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(9) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(6) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(26) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325, 403291461126605635584000000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(14) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(13) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(1) == [1]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(22) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(17) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(20) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(19) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(11) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(23) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(7) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28]", "def check(f):\n\tassert f(28) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66, 479001600, 91, 87178291200, 120, 20922789888000, 153, 6402373705728000, 190, 2432902008176640000, 231, 1124000727777607680000, 276, 620448401733239439360000, 325, 403291461126605635584000000, 378, 304888344611713860501504000000]"], "entry_point": "f", "completion": "from typing import *\ndef factorial(num):\n    if num == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return num * factorial(num -
