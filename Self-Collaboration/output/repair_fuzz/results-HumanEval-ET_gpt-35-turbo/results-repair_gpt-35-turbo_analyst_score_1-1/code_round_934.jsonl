The range is defined in such a way that it includes both x and y. In other words, both endpoints of the range are part of the interval. If there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\nFor example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    '''", "def choose_num(x, y):\t\n'''This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive, which includes both x and y. If there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\nFor example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "test_case_list": ["assert choose_num(4249, 4823) == 4822", "assert choose_num(5373, 4639) == -1", "assert choose_num(31, 6) == -1", "assert choose_num(37, 13023) == 13022", "assert choose_num(34, 13247) == 13246", "assert choose_num(29, 15) == -1", "assert choose_num(3, 9) == 8", "assert choose_num(12, 15) == 14", "assert choose_num(4, 4) == 4", "assert choose_num(550, 543) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 34) == 34", "assert choose_num(6, 11) == 10", "assert choose_num(3, 12) == 12", "assert choose_num(23, 10) == -1", "assert choose_num(32, 11) == -1", "assert choose_num(18, 16) == -1", "assert choose_num(27, 10) == -1\n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.", "assert choose_num(8, 15) == 14", "assert choose_num(545, 546) == 546", "assert choose_num(547, 549) == 548", "assert choose_num(9, 28) == 28", "assert choose_num(34, 12634) == 12634", "assert choose_num(550, 542) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 19) == 18", "assert choose_num(2, 9) == 8", "assert choose_num(4, 2) == -1", "assert choose_num(11, 10) == -1", "assert choose_num(542, 543) == 542", "assert choose_num(11, 11) == -1", "assert choose_num(5234, 5233) == -1", "assert choose_num(17, 13) == -1", "assert choose_num(28, 6) == -1", "assert choose_num(36, 12359) == 12358", "assert choose_num(547, 542) == -1", "assert choose_num(4292, 5649) == 5648", "assert choose_num(31, 13152) == 13152", "assert choose_num(4796, 5300) == 5300", "assert choose_num(29, 12690) == 12690", "assert choose_num(9, 11) == 10", "assert choose_num(4637, 5993) == 5992", "assert choose_num(36, 11801) == 11800", "assert choose_num(27, 6) == -1", "assert choose_num(548, 542) == -1", "assert choose_num(11, 30) == 30", "assert choose_num(31, 13214) == 13214", "assert choose_num(32, 13283) == 13282", "assert choose_num(4494, 4861) == 4860", "assert choose_num(9, 27) == 26", "assert choose_num(13, 12) == -1", "assert choose_num(8, 31) == 30", "assert choose_num(14, 9) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 11) == 10", "assert choose_num(36, 11976) == 11976", "assert choose_num(10, 29) == 28", "assert choose_num(17, 15) == -1", "assert choose_num(13, 9) == -1", "assert choose_num(547, 548) == 548", "assert choose_num(10, 14) == 14", "assert choose_num(549, 549) == -1", "assert choose_num(542, 547) == 546", "assert choose_num(541, 542) == 542", "assert choose_num(34, 12261) == 12260", "assert choose_num(8, 13) == 12", "assert choose_num(3, 7) == 6", "assert choose_num(33, 12354) == 12354", "assert choose_num(12, 7) == -1", "assert choose_num(31, 12815) == 12814", "assert choose_num(4756, 5476) == 5476", "assert choose_num(29, 10) == -1", "assert choose_num(16, 17) == 16", "assert choose_num(9, 24) == 24", "assert choose_num(6, 3) == -1", "assert choose_num(5338, 5267) == -1", "assert choose_num(4547, 5362) == 5362", "assert choose_num(8, 26) == 26", "assert choose_num(11, 12) == 12", "assert choose_num(25, 13) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 7) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 16) == 16", "assert choose_num(4883, 5654) == 5654", "assert choose_num(8, 32) == 32", "assert choose_num(6, 29) == 28", "assert choose_num(38, 12926) == 12926", "assert choose_num(9, 7) == -1", "assert choose_num(12, 6) == -1", "assert choose_num(15, 14) == -1", "assert choose_num(10, 8) == -1", "assert choose_num(11, 29) == 28", "assert choose_num(14, 11) == -1", "assert choose_num(13, 17) == 16", "assert choose_num(5, 8) == 8", "assert choose_num(546, 549) == 548", "assert choose_num(8, 14) == 14", "assert choose_num(5, 26) == 26", "assert choose_num(8, 12) == 12", "assert choose_num(31, 12511) == 12510", "assert choose_num(32, 10) == -1", "assert choose_num(7, 10) == 10", "assert choose_num(6087, 4359) == -1", "assert choose_num(31, 10) == -1", "assert choose_num(10, 11) == 10", "assert choose_num(4386, 4651) == 4650", "assert choose_num(27, 5) == -1", "assert choose_num(546, 546) == 546", "assert choose_num(30, 13282) == 13282", "assert choose_num(6, 32) == 32", "assert choose_num(14, 15) == 14", "assert choose_num(11, 13) == 12", "assert choose_num(5962, 4558) == -1", "assert choose_num(543, 542) == -1", "assert choose_num(1, 32) == 32", "assert choose_num(5830, 5508) == -1", "assert choose_num(4623, 5093) == 5092", "assert choose_num(32, 7) == -1", "assert choose_num(546, 550) == 550", "assert choose_num(28, 13) == -1"], "save_node": false, "pass": true, "parent_index": 427, "round": 934}
