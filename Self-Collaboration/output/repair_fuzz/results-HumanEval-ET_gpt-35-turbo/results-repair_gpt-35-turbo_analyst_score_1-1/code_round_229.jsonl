{"task_id": "HumanEval/106", "prompt": "def f(n):\t\n'''Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter, and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. i starts from 1. The factorial of a number i refers to the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i.
