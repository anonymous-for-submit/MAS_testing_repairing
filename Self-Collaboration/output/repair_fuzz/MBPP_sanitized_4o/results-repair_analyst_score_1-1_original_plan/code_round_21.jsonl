represent the number of ways a set can be partitioned. They have significance in combinatorial mathematics and counting problems.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they are all distinct tasks that build upon each other.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bell_number(0) = 1\n    Explanation: When there are 0 elements in the set, there is only one way to partition it (empty set).\n    bell_number(1) = 1\n    Explanation: When there is 1 element in the set, there is only one way to partition it (the element itself).\n    bell_number(2) = 2\n    Explanation: When there are 2 elements in the set, there are 2 ways to partition it ({1,2} and {{1}, {2}}).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
