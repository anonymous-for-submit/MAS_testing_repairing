inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum absolute product'\n    Explanation: The core concept is to find the maximum product of numbers in pairs of tuples within the list, considering the absolute value of the product.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps should be implemented sequentially as described in the plan. There are no steps that need to be implemented simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_product_tuple([]) = 0\n    Explanation: In the case of an empty list, the function should return 0 as there are no tuples to calculate the product from.\n    max_product_tuple([(0, 5), (2, 3)]) = 15\n    Explanation: The product of (0, 5) is 0, and the product of (2, 3) is 6. The absolute value of 0 is 0, and the absolute value of 6 is 6.
