degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented step by step as they are sequential and do not require simultaneous execution.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_list([]) = 0\n    Explanation: When the input list is empty, there are no sublists to count, so the expected output is 0.\n    count_list([[1], [2], [3]]) = 3\n    Explanation: Each element in the main list is a sublist, so the count of sublists is equal to the length of the main list, which is 3.\n    count_list([1, 2, 3]) = 0\n    Explanation: The elements in the main list are not lists themselves, so there are no sublists to count.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not lst:\n            return 0\n        count = 0\n        for sublist in lst:\n
