other.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_Volume(0, 8, 6) = 0\n    Explanation: When the base of the triangle is 0, the volume of the triangular prism should be 0.\n    find_Volume(10, 0, 6) = 0\n    Explanation: When the height of the triangle is 0, the volume of the triangular prism should be 0.\n    find_Volume(10, 8, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: When the height of the prism is 0, the volume of the triangular prism should be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if base == 0 or triangle_height == 0 or prism_height == 0:\n            return
