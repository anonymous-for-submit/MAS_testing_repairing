 'sequences'\n    Explanation: A sequence is a list of elements following a specific order or pattern.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than or equal to twice': Each element in the sequence should be at least double the previous element.\n    'less than or equal to': Each element in the sequence should not exceed a certain value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb in this requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps 3 and 4 should be implemented simultaneously as they involve checking the conditions for each element in the sequence.\n    This can be done by iterating through the sequence and checking both conditions in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_total_number_of_sequences(1, 4) = 0\n    Explanation: With m=1, it is impossible to have a sequence where each element is at least twice the previous element.\n    get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 1) = 10\n    Explanation: When n=1, there are 10 possible sequences with elements from
