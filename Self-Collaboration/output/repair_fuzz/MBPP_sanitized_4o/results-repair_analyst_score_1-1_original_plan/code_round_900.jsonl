before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'binary sequences': Refers to sequences composed of only 0s and 1s.\n    'sum of the first n bits equals the sum of the last n bits': Implies that the count of 1s in the first n bits should be equal to the count of 1s in the last n bits.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they involve different aspects of problem-solving and optimization.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_binary_seq(0) = 1.0\n    Explanation: For n=0, there is only one valid binary sequence, which is an empty sequence with no 1s.\n    count_binary_seq(2) = 6.0\n    Explanation: For n=2, the valid binary sequences are 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, where the sum of the first 2 bits equals the sum of the last 2 bits.\n    count_binary_seq(3) = 20.0\n    Explanation: For n=3, the valid binary sequences are calculated based on combinatorial methods, ensuring the sum of the first 3 bits equals the sum of the last 3 bits.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n == 0:\n            return 1.0\n        elif n == 1:\n            return 2.0\n        (other code)\n\n# NO", "Round_0": {"code": "def count_binary_seq(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return
