Find perfect squares\": \"Iterate through the range of numbers and check if each number is a perfect square.\",\n    \"4. Return the list of perfect squares\": \"Return a list of all perfect squares found within the given range.\"\n  }\n}\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'perfect squares'\n    Explanation: Perfect squares are numbers that are the result of squaring an integer, meaning they are the square of an integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps should be implemented sequentially as there are no steps that need to be executed simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    perfect_squares(1, 30) == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n    Explanation: The perfect squares between 1 and 30 are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        To handle the scenario where the input numbers themselves could be perfect squares, we need to check if the square root of the input numbers is an integer and include them in the list if they are perfect squares. \n\n        For example:\n        if int(math.sqrt(low)) == math.sqrt(low):\n            perfect_squares_list.append(low)\n        if int(math.sqrt(high)) == math.sqrt(high):\n            perfect_squares_list.append(high)\n        (other code) \n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "import
