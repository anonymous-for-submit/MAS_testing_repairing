There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m.

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot has the ability to move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is provided. Each command is represented by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and causes movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins its journey from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFind out the cell the robot should start its journey from in order to carry out the maximum possible commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2", "completions": ["t = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    commands = input()\n\n    max_commands = 0\n    start_cell = (1, 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\n            x, y = i, j\n            count = 0\n            for command in commands:\n                if command == 'L':\n                    y -= 1\n                elif command == 'R':\n                    y += 1\n                elif command == 'U':\n                    x -= 1\n                elif command == 'D':\n                    x += 1\n                \n                if x < 1 or x > n or y < 1 or y > m:\n                    break\n                \n                count += 1\n            \n            if count > max_commands:\n                max_commands = count\n                start_cell = (i, j)\n    \n    print(start_cell[0], start_cell[1])\n\nmain()", "# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Iterate through each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    #

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nEach cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell. It will either move left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move.\n\n  * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. \n  * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). \n\nRobot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops.\n\nDetermine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written. It does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line.

This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board.

Ensure the input permutation is valid before processing queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries:\n\n  * 1 x y \u2014 swap p_x and p_y. \n  * 2 i k \u2014 print the number that i will become if we assign i = p_i k times. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers. The first integer is t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2) \u2014 type of query. If t = 1, then the next two integers are x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; x \u2260 y) \u2014 first-type query. If t = 2, then the next two integers are i and k (1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 n) \u2014 second-type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every second-type query, print one integer in a new line \u2014 answer to this query.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n5 3 4 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 9\n2 3 5 1 4\n2 3 5\n2 5 5\n2 5 1\n2 5 3\n2 5 4\n1 5 4\n2 5 3\n2 2 5\n2 5 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n5\n4\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example p = \\{5, 3, 4, 2, 1\\}. \n\nThe first query is to print p_3. The answer is 4.\n\nThe second query is to print p_{p_1}. The answer is 1.\n\nThe third query is to swap p_1 and p_3. Now p = \\{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}.\n\nThe fourth query is to print p_{p_1}.

Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U'. Each symbol triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge.

The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right. The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell, and it will either move left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell and then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, and its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written. It does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line.

This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

You aim to remove certain elements from a to maximize f(a), using zero or more operations, and determine the greatest possible f(a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "completions": ["def largest_f_a(n, a):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == i + 1:\n            count += 1\n    return min(count + 1, max(count, sum(1 for i in a if i == i + 1)))\n\n# Input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output\nprint(largest_f_a(n, a))\n\nmain()", "def largest_f_a(n, a):\n    indices = [i+1 for i, val in enumerate(a) if val == i+1]\n    max_f_a = len(indices)\n    return max_f_a\n\n# Input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output\nresult = largest_f_a(n, a)\nprint(result)\n\nmain()", "def largest_f_a(n, a):\n    count = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in a:\n        if i <= n:\n            count[i] += 1\n    \n    max_count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        max_count = max(max_count, count[i])\n    \n    return max_count\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(largest_f_a(n, a))\n\nmain()", "def maximize_f_a(n, a):\n    indices = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i in a]\n    max_f_a = 0\n    for i in range(len(indices)):\n        count = 0\n        for j in range(len(a)):\n            if a[j] == indices[i]:\n                count += 1\n        max_f_a = max(max_f_a, count)\n    return max_f_a\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(maximize_f_a(n, a))\n\nmain()", "def count_indices(sequence):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[i] == i + 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef largest_f(sequence):\n    max_f = 0\n    for i in range(len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[i] != i + 1:\n            new_sequence = sequence[:i] + sequence[i+1:]\n            max_f = max(max_f, count_indices(new_sequence))\n    return max_f\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input())\n    sequence = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = largest_f(sequence)\n    print(result)\n\nmain()", "def maximize_f_a(n, a):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == i + 1:\n            count += 1\n    \n    max_count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == i + 1:\n            temp_count = count -

A permutation of n elements is an array of length n containing each integer from 1 to n exactly once; for example, [1, 2, 3] and [4, 3, 5, 1, 2] are permutations, but [1, 2, 4] and [4, 3, 2, 1, 2] are not permutations since the latter example fails because it does not contain integers from 1 to n exactly once, and you should perform q queries after ensuring the input permutation is valid. \n\nThere are two types of queries:\n\n  * 1 x y \u2014 swap p_x and p_y. \n  * 2 i k \u2014 print the number that i will become if we assign i = p_i k times.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers.

{"index": 62, "parent": 4, "child": [76], "score": true, "passes": 2, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "prompt": "You are presented with an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] consisting solely of zeroes and ones. Keep in mind that in this particular problem, unlike the others, the array indices start from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules:\n\n1. Initially, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d positions. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i \\& a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator.\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0 \\& 1, 0 \\& 0, 1 \\& 0, 1 \\& 1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, decide whether it will comprise only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also compute the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "completions": ["def cyclic_shift_and_operation(t, test_cases):\n    def apply_operations(arr, d):\n        steps = 0\n        while

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nEach cell contains one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', denoting the direction the robot will move when it enters that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can initiate its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move.\n\n  * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks.\n  * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore).\n\nRobot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops.\n\nDecide which square the robot should start its movement from to execute the maximum number of commands possible.

Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes. You need to consider the most efficient way to simulate this process to arrive at the solution.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.

{"index": 76, "parent": 62, "child": [], "score": true, "passes": 1, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "prompt": "You have an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] composed entirely of zeros and ones. Remember, in this specific problem, unlike others, the indices of the array begin at zero instead of one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules:\n\n1. Initially, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d positions. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n2. Following this, each element of the array a_i is substituted with a_i \\& a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator.\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0 \\& 1, 0 \\& 0, 1 \\& 0, 1 \\& 1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process concludes when the array ceases to change. For a given array a, determine if it will consist entirely of zeros at the end of the process. If so, calculate the number of steps the process will take before it stops.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot has the ability to move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells. These adjacent cells are positioned by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is provided. Each command is represented by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and causes movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins its journey from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFind out the cell the robot should start its journey from in order to carry out the maximum possible commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot has the ability to move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells. These adjacent cells are placed next to each other by side. This means the robot can move in four possible directions at any point.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is provided. Each command is represented by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and causes movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins its journey from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFind out the cell the robot should start its journey from in order to carry out the maximum possible commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on.

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right. The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side; each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' indicating the direction to move (left, right, down or up, respectively). The robot can start its movement in any cell and then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, and its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written. It does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line.

This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt implies that the entire array a^{\u2192 d} can be expressed as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes. You need to consider the most efficient way to simulate this process to arrive at the solution.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nEach cell contains one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', denoting the direction the robot will move when it enters that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can initiate its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move.\n\n  * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks.\n  * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore).\n\nRobot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops.\n\nDecide which square the robot should start its movement from to execute the maximum number of commands possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). \n\nConsider the efficiency of your solution in terms of time and space complexity.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.
