Define f(a) as the count of positions where a_i equals i. \n\nYou can pick an element from the current sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements together. For instance, if you eliminate the 3rd element from the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the resulting sequence will be [4, 2, 1]. \n\nYour goal is to delete some elements from a so that you can maximize f(a), using zero or more operations. Find the largest possible f(a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "save_node": true, "parent_index": 95}
