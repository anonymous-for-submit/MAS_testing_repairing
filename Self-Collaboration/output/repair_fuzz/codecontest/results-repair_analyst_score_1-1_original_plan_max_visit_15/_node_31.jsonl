There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m.

What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100).

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot has the ability to move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is provided. Each command is represented by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and causes movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins its journey from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFind out the cell the robot should start its journey from in order to carry out the maximum possible commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2", "completions": ["t = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    commands = input()\n\n    max_commands = 0\n    start_cell = (1, 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\n            x, y = i, j\n            count = 0\n            for command in commands:\n                if command == 'L':\n                    y -= 1\n                elif command == 'R':\n                    y += 1\n                elif command == 'U':\n                    x -= 1\n                elif command == 'D':\n                    x += 1\n                \n                if x < 1 or x > n or y < 1 or y > m:\n                    break\n                \n                count += 1\n            \n            if count > max_commands:\n                max_commands = count\n                start_cell = (i, j)\n    \n    print(start_cell[0], start_cell[1])\n\nmain()", "# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Iterate through each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    #

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nEach cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell. It will either move left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move.\n\n  * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. \n  * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). \n\nRobot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops.\n\nDetermine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written. It does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line.

This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board.

For example, [1, 2, 3] and [4, 3, 5, 1, 2] are permutations, but [1, 2, 4] and [4, 3, 2, 1, 2] are not permutations. This latter example fails because it does not contain integers from 1 to n exactly once. You should perform q queries. Ensure the input permutation is valid before processing queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries:\n\n  * 1 x y \u2014 swap p_x and p_y. \n  * 2 i k \u2014 print the number that i will become if we assign i = p_i k times. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers. The first integer is t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2) \u2014 type of query. If t = 1, then the next two integers are x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; x \u2260 y) \u2014 first-type query. If t = 2, then the next two integers are i and k (1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 n) \u2014 second-type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every second-type query, print one integer in a new line \u2014 answer to this query.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n5 3 4 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 9\n2 3 5 1 4\n2 3 5\n2 5 5\n2 5 1\n2 5 3\n2 5 4\n1 5 4\n2 5 3\n2 2 5\n2 5 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n5\n4\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example p = \\{5, 3, 4, 2, 1\\}. \n\nThe first query is to print p_3. The answer is 4.\n\nThe second query is to print p_{p_1}. The answer is 1.\n\nThe third query is to swap p_1 and p_3. Now p = \\{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}.\n\nThe fourth query is to print p_{p_1}.

Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U'. Each symbol triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge.

The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.
