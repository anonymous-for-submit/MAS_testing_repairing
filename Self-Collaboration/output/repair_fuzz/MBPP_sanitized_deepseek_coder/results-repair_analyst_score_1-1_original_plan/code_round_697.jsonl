The nth Jacobsthal number can be computed using the previous two Jacobsthal numbers.\n    Explanation: Jacobsthal numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is defined by the sum of the two preceding numbers, with the first two numbers being 0 and 1. The sequence starts as 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341", "Round_0": {"code": "def jacobsthal_num(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    \n    # Compute the nth Jacobsthal number using the recurrence relation\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        c = a + 2 * b\n
