It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. This process continues until the target element is found or the interval is empty.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps", "Round_0": {"code": "def last(arr, target, n):\n    left, right, result = 0, n - 1, -1\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            result = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    return result", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Understand the binary search algorithm and how it can be adapted to find the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Define the problem in terms of binary search principles.\",\n          \"Modify the binary search algorithm to track the last occurrence of the target element.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Implement the binary search algorithm to find the last occurrence of an element.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Initialize low and high pointers.\",\n          \"While low is less than or equal to high:\",\n          \"Calculate the middle index.\",\n          \"If the element at the middle index is less than the target, move the low pointer to middle + 1.\",\n          \"If the element at the middle index is greater than or equal to the target, move the high pointer to middle - 1 and update the result if the middle index is the last occurrence.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Handle edge cases such as empty arrays or elements not present in the array.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Check if the array is empty and return -1 if true.\",\n          \"If the target element is not found by the end of the search, return -1.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_steps\": [\n      \"Analyze the user requirement and decompose it into subproblems.\",\n      \"Implement the binary search algorithm to find the last occurrence of the target element.\",\n      \"Handle edge cases to ensure robustness.\",\n      \"Test the function with various inputs to verify correctness.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary search': a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.\n    Explanation: Binary search works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the target value, thus reducing the search area by half each time.
