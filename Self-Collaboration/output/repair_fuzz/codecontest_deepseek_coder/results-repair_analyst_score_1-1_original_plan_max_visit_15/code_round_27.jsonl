{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

[core concept]\n    'watering schedule': The pattern of when the flower is watered over a given number of days.\n    Explanation: The flower's growth depends on whether it is watered on specific days. If watered on the i-th day, it grows by 1 cm. If watered on both the i-th and (i-1)-th day, it grows by 5 cm. If not watered on the i-th day, it does not grow. If not watered for two consecutive days, the flower dies.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than':", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    results = []  # List to store the results for each test case\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())  # Read the number of days for the current test case\n        watering_schedule = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the watering schedule\n\n        height = 1  # Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm\n        died = False  # Flag to check if the flower has died\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if watering_schedule[i] == 1:\n                height += 1  # Grow by 1 cm if watered on the i-th day\n            elif watering_schedule[i] == 1 and watering_schedule[i - 1] == 1:\n                height += 5  # Grow by 5 cm if watered on both the i-th and (i-1)-th day\n\n            if watering_schedule[i] == 0 and watering_schedule[i - 1] == 0:\n                died = True  # The flower dies if not watered for two consecutive days\n                break\n\n        if died:\n            results.append(-1)  # Store -1 if the flower has died\n        else:\n            results.append(height)  # Store the final height of the flower\n\n    # Output the results for all test cases\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: "}, "Round_1": {"code": "def main():\n    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    results = []  # List to store the results for each test case\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())  # Read the number of days for the current test case\n        watering_schedule = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the watering schedule\n\n        height = 1  # Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm\n        died = False  # Flag to check if the flower has died\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if watering_schedule[i] == 1:\n                height += 1  # Grow by 1 cm if watered on the i-th day\n            elif watering_schedule[i] == 1 and watering_schedule[i - 1] == 1:\n                height += 5  # Grow by 5 cm if watered on both the i-th and (i-1)-th day\n\n            if watering_schedule[i] == 0 and watering_schedule[i - 1] == 0:\n                died = True  # The flower dies if not watered for two consecutive days\n                break\n\n        if died:\n            results.append(-1)  # Store -1 if the flower has died\n        else:\n            results.append(height)  # Store the final height of the flower\n\n    # Output the results for all test cases\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)"}}, {"plan": " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the number of test cases and initialize the results list.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"For each test case, read the number of days (n) and the watering schedule (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Initialize the height of the flower to 1 cm and check if the flower has been watered on the first day.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Iterate through each day from the second day to the n-th day, updating the flower's height based on the watering schedule.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Check if the flower has died by not being watered for two consecutive days.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Store the final height of the flower for each test case or -1 if the flower has died.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Output the results for all test cases.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_steps\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Initialize the results list.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the number of test cases.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Loop through each test case.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"For each test case, read the number of days and the watering schedule.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Initialize the flower's height and check the first day's watering.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Iterate through each day, updating the flower's height based on the watering schedule.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Check if the flower has died and store the result.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Output the results.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'watering schedule': the sequence of days on which the flower is watered, which affects its growth.\n    Explanation: The flower's growth depends on whether it is watered on specific days.
