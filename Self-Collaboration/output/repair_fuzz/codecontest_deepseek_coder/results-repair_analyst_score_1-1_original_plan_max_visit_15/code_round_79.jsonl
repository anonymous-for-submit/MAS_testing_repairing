He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array b of 7 integers.\n\nFor example, if a = \\{1, 4, 3\\}, then Polycarp wrote out 1, 4, 3, 1 + 4 = 5, 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8.

That is, the values of the elements don't matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, any array of length 3 has exactly 7 different non-empty subsequences.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "save_node": true, "parent_index": 66}
