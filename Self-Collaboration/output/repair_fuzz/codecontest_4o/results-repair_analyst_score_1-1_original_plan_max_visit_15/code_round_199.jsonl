{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

The task is to find a permutation that maximizes the surprise value.\n\n    'surprise value'\n    Explanation: The surprise value is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the expected points and the actual points obtained by each student. The goal is to maximize this value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the task is to find the permutation that results in the highest possible surprise value. In code, this means iterating over all permutations and selecting the one with the highest calculated surprise value.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This refers to the largest possible value of the surprise value. In code, this involves comparing calculated surprise values and keeping track of the largest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to generating permutations and calculating surprise values should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, generating permutations and calculating the surprise value for each should be done in a loop, where each permutation is evaluated immediately after it is generated.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with n = 1 and m = 1, x = [0], s = [\"0\"]\n       Expected output: 1\n       Explanation: With only one question and the student expecting 0 points, the permutation [1] results in a surprise value of 1, which is the maximum possible.\n\n    2. Test case with n = 1 and m = 2, x = [1], s = [\"01\"]\n       Expected output: 2 1\n       Explanation: The student expects 1 point but answers the second question correctly. The permutation [2, 1] results in a surprise value of 1, which is the maximum possible.\n\n    3. Test case with n = 2 and m = 2, x = [1, 1], s = [\"10\", \"01\"]\n       Expected output: 2 1\n       Explanation: Both students expect 1 point. The permutation [2, 1] results in a surprise value of 2, which is the maximum possible.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of generating permutations and calculating the surprise value will naturally handle these cases.\n\n", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef calculate_surprise_value(n, m, x, answers, permutation):\n    surprise_value = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        actual_points = sum(permutation[j] for j in range(m) if answers[i][j] == '1')\n        surprise_value += abs(x[i] -
