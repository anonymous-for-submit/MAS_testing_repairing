{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

It grows by 1 cm if watered, by 5 cm if watered consecutively, and dies if not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates a condition where the flower dies if not watered for two consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive elements in the list are 0.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This indicates the flower grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 1 when a_i = 1.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This indicates the flower grows by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 5 when both a_i = 1 and a_(i-1) = 1.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to checking the watering pattern and updating the flower's height should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the logic for checking if the flower is watered and updating the height should be in the same loop iteration.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 1 0\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it requires two consecutive days of not being watered to die.\n\n    Input: 2 0 0\n    Expected Output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower dies because it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n    Input: 3 1 1 1\n    Expected Output: 11\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 1 cm on the first day, then by 5 cm on the second and third days due to consecutive watering.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
