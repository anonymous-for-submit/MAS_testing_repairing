{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

'portal'\n    Explanation: A portal is defined as a sub-rectangle of size a \u00d7 b that meets specific conditions regarding the arrangement of obsidian and empty blocks.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5': The number of rows in the portal must be at least 5.\n    'b must be at least 4': The number of columns in the portal must be no less than 4.\n    Implementation: These conditions can be checked using simple comparison operations in code.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': The goal is to find the least number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal.\n    Implementation: This can be achieved by iterating through all possible sub-rectangles and keeping track of the smallest number of operations required.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking portal conditions and calculating operations should be implemented simultaneously.\n    Explanation: When iterating over sub-rectangles, checking conditions and calculating operations can be done in a single loop to optimize performance.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Example: \n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already satisfies portal conditions.\n\n    Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Example: \n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Expected Output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Case 3: A rectangle with alternating obsidian and empty blocks.\n    Example: \n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected Output: 8\n    Explanation: Only the border blocks need to be changed to form a portal.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Explanation: The code should include logic to efficiently calculate the number of operations needed for various configurations of blocks, especially for edge cases", "Round_0":
