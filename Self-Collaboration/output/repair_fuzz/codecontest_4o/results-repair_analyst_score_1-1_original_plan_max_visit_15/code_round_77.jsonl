{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

In code, this can be represented by multiplying the count of each type of song by its duration (1, 2, or 3) to get the total duration.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimal'\n    Explanation: This indicates the need to find the smallest possible value. In code, this can be implemented by iterating through possible partitions and keeping track of the smallest difference found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to parsing input and calculating total duration can be implemented sequentially. However, the step to partition the songs into two groups to minimize the difference should be considered as a single logical block, potentially using a dynamic programming or greedy approach.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 0 0 = 1\n    Explanation: With one one-minute song and no other songs, the only possible partition results in a difference of 1 minute.\n\n    0 0 0 = 0\n    Explanation: With no songs, the difference is naturally 0.\n\n    1 1 1 = 0\n    Explanation: As given in the example, one possible partition results in a difference of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the number of songs is very small or zero.\n    ```python\n    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:\n        print(0)\n    elif a + b + c == 1:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        # Implement the logic to partition songs\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        \n        # If total duration is odd, the minimal difference is 1\n        # If total duration is even, the minimal difference is 0\n        if total_duration % 2 == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n        else:\n            results.append(1)\n    \n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimal_difference(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 77, "prompt": "Luntik has decided to try singing.
