{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

It means we need to find the k-th smallest special number.\n    'modulo 10^9+7': This means that the result should be presented as the remainder when divided by 10^9+7, which is a common technique to handle large numbers in competitive programming.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing order': This means the sequence of special numbers should be sorted from smallest to largest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Generate a list of special numbers for the given n using distinct powers of n\" and \"Sort the list of special numbers in increasing order\" should be considered simultaneously. This can be done by generating the numbers in a way that they are already sorted, which avoids the need for an explicit sorting step.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. n = 2, k = 1 = 1\n       Explanation: The smallest special number for n = 2 is 1 (2^0).\n    2. n = 2, k = 2 = 2\n       Explanation: The second smallest special number for n = 2 is 2 (2^1).\n    3. n = 10^9, k = 1 = 1\n       Explanation: The smallest special number for any n is always 1 (n^0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic of generating special numbers using powers of n inherently handles these cases, as the smallest special number is always 1, and subsequent numbers are generated based on powers of n.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def find_kth_special_number(t, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    results = []\n\n    for n, k in test_cases:\n        result = 0\n        power = 1\n        while k > 0:\n            if k % 2 == 1:\n                result = (result + power) % MOD\n            power = (power * n) % MOD\n            k //= 2\n        results.append(result)\n\n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        k = int(data[index + 1])\n        test_cases.append((n, k))\n        index += 2\n    \n    results = find_kth_special_number(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 163, "prompt": "Theofanis is fond of sequences of positive integers, so his educator (Yeltsa Kcir) presented him with a challenge involving a sequence that includes only special numbers.\n\nLet's define a positive number as special if it can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n.
