{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

In this requirement, it refers to the difference in total durations of the two concerts.\n\n    'minimal possible difference'\n    Explanation: This means finding the smallest possible value of the absolute difference between the durations of the two concerts.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'one-minute', 'two-minute', 'three-minute'\n    Explanation: These phrases indicate the duration of each type of song. In code, this can be represented by multiplying the number of each type of song by its respective duration (1, 2, or 3) to calculate total durations.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest', 'minimal'\n    Explanation: These terms indicate that the goal is to achieve the lowest possible value for the difference in concert durations. In code, this involves finding the optimal distribution of songs to minimize the difference.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for calculating the total duration and determining the minimal possible difference should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach to find the minimal difference should be integrated with the calculation of total durations.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 0 0 = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, the minimal difference is 1, as it must be assigned to one concert.\n\n    0 0 0 = 0\n    Explanation: With no songs, the difference is 0, as both concerts have a duration of 0.\n\n    1 1 1 = 0\n    Explanation: As explained in the example, the songs can be distributed to achieve a difference of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the number of songs is extremely unbalanced or when there are no songs at all. This can be managed by checking the total number of songs and their distribution before applying the dynamic programming approach.\n\n    ```python\n    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:\n

In code, this involves finding the optimal distribution of songs to minimize the difference.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for calculating the total duration and determining the minimal possible difference should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach to find the minimal difference should be integrated with the calculation of total durations.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 0 0 = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, the minimal difference is 1, as it must be assigned to one concert.\n\n    0 0 0 = 0\n    Explanation: With no songs, the difference is 0, as both concerts have a duration of 0.\n\n    1 1 1 = 0\n    Explanation: As explained in the example, the songs can be distributed to achieve a difference of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the number of songs is extremely unbalanced or when there are no songs at all. This can be managed by checking the total number of songs and their distribution before applying the dynamic programming approach.\n\n    ```python\n    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Additional logic for handling unbalanced cases\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        half_duration = total_duration // 2\n        \n        # Dynamic programming approach to find the closest sum to half_duration\n        dp = [False] * (half_duration + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for _ in range(a):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 1:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 1]\n        \n        for _ in range(b):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 2:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 2]\n        \n        for _ in range(c):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 3:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 3]\n        \n        # Find the closest sum to half_duration\n        closest_sum = 0\n        for i in range(half_duration + 1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                closest_sum = i\n        \n        # Calculate the minimal possible difference\n        difference = abs(total_duration - 2 * closest_sum)\n        results.append(difference)\n    \n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimal_difference(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: timed out"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        half_duration = total_duration // 2\n        \n        # Dynamic programming approach to find the closest sum to half_duration\n        dp = [False] * (half_duration + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        # Process one-minute songs\n        for _ in range(a):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 1:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 1]\n        \n        # Process two-minute songs\n        for _ in range(b):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 2:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 2]\n        \n        # Process three-minute songs\n        for _ in range(c):\n            for j in range(half_duration, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 3:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 3]\n        \n        # Find the closest sum to half_duration\n        closest_sum = 0\n        for i in range(half_duration + 1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                closest_sum = i\n        \n        # Calculate the minimal possible difference\n        difference = abs(total_duration - 2 * closest_sum)\n        results.append(difference)\n    \n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimal_difference(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 284, "prompt": "Luntik has decided to try singing.
