{"name": "1617_A. Forbidden Subsequence", "description": "You are given strings S and T, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that T is a permutation of the string abc. \n\nFind string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'.\n\nString a is a permutation of string b if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings.\n\nA string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:\n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b;\n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string S (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100), consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string T that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence, |T| = 3).\n\nNote that there is no limit on the sum of |S| across all test cases.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n7\nabacaba\nabc\ncccba\nacb\ndbsic\nbac\nabracadabra\nabc\ndddddddddddd\ncba\nbbc\nabc\nac\nabc\n\n\nOutput\n\n\naaaacbb\nabccc\nbcdis\naaaaacbbdrr\ndddddddddddd\nbbc\nac\n\nNote\n\nIn

In this requirement, T is a permutation of \"abc\", meaning T can be any arrangement of \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\".\n\n    'lexicographically smallest'\n    Explanation: This means the smallest string in dictionary order. For example, \"abc\" is lexicographically smaller than \"acb\".\n\n    'subsequence'\n    Explanation: A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, \"abc\" is a subsequence of \"aebdc\".\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrases showing quantity relationships are present in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This indicates that among all possible permutations of S, we need to find the one that is the smallest in lexicographical order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to generating the permutation and checking for the subsequence should be considered simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Sort the characters of S based on their lexicographical order.\"\n    - \"Check if T can be formed as a subsequence from the sorted permutation of S.\"\n    - \"If T is a subsequence, adjust the permutation to prevent T from being a subsequence while maintaining lexicographical order.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single code block where the sorted string is checked and adjusted if necessary.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: S = \"abc\", T = \"abc\" => Output: \"acb\"\n    Explanation: \"abc\" is a subsequence of itself, so we need to rearrange it to \"acb\" which is lexicographically smallest and does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n\n    Case 2: S = \"aabbcc\", T = \"abc\" => Output: \"aabcbc\"\n    Explanation: \"aabbcc\" sorted is \"aabbcc\", which contains \"abc\" as a subsequence. Rearranging to \"aabcbc\" avoids \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n\n    Case 3: S = \"cba\", T = \"abc\" => Output: \"bac\"\n    Explanation: \"cba\" sorted is \"abc\", which contains \"abc\" as a subsequence.

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a string S (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100), consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string T that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence, |T| = 3).\n\nNote that there is no limit on the sum of |S| across all test cases.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n7\nabacaba\nabc\ncccba\nacb\ndbsic\nbac\nabracadabra\nabc\ndddddddddddd\ncba\nbbc\nabc\nac\nabc\n\n\nOutput\n\n\naaaacbb\nabccc\nbcdis\naaaaacbbdrr\ndddddddddddd\nbbc\nac\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both aaaabbc and aaaabcb are lexicographically smaller than aaaacbb, but they contain abc as a subsequence.\n\nIn the second test case, abccc is the smallest permutation of cccba and does not contain acb as a subsequence.\n\nIn the third test case, bcdis is the smallest permutation of dbsic and does not contain bac as a subsequence.", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 42}
