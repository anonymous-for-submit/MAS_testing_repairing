{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3
