{"name": "1582_C. Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf", "description": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "tags": ["brute

The requirement is to transform the given string into a palindrome by erasing occurrences of a single character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum number of erased symbols': This means finding the smallest number of characters that need to be removed to make the string a palindrome.\n    'if it is possible': This indicates a condition where the transformation to a palindrome is feasible; otherwise, the output should be -1.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum': This refers to the least number of characters that need to be erased to achieve a palindrome.

This can be done by writing a loop that iterates over each character, removes it, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome using the function.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with a single character string: \n    Input: 1\n           1\n           a\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: A single character string is already a palindrome, so no erasures are needed.\n\n    Test case with a string that cannot be transformed into a palindrome:\n    Input: 1\n           3\n           abc\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: No single character removal can make 'abc' a palindrome.\n\n    Test case with a string that is already a palindrome:\n    Input: 1\n           5\n           madam\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: The string 'madam' is already a palindrome, so no erasures are needed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the string is already a palindrome or cannot be transformed into one.\n    ```python\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    def min_erasures_to_palindrome(s):\n        if is_palindrome(s):\n            return 0\n        # Logic to find minimum erasures\n        # If no palindrome can be formed, return -1\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_erasures_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(s)\n    min_erasures = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in set(s):\n        filtered = [c for c in s if c != char]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            min_erasures = min(min_erasures, n - len(filtered))\n    \n    return min_erasures if min_erasures != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        result = min_erasures_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: min_erasures_to_palindrome() missing 1 required positional argument: 's'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_erasures_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(s)\n    min_erasures = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in set(s):\n        filtered = [c for c in s if c != char]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            min_erasures = min(min_erasures, n - len(filtered))\n    \n    return min_erasures if min_erasures != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        result = min_erasures_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 381, "prompt": "Grandma Capa is determined to create the most beautiful scarf possible using Grandpa Sher's pattern.
