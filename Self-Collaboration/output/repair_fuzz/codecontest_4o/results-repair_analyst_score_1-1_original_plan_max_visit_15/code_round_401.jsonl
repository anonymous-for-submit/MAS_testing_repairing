{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The direction can change to '2' once a ball leaves a cell, indicating a downward movement.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': The grid can have up to 1000 rows and columns.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n    '1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3': Each cell in the grid can have a direction value between 1 and 3.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': The starting column for each ball is within the grid's column range.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the movement of a single ball and updating the grid should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the logic to move the ball and update the cell's direction should be in the same loop to ensure the grid is updated correctly as the ball moves.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Grid with only one row and one column (1x1 grid), ball dropped in that column:\n       Input: 1 1 1\n              1\n              1\n       Output: 2\n       Explanation: The ball moves right and exits the grid immediately.\n\n    2.

All cells initially direct the ball to move left or right at the edges: If the first row has a 1 in the last column or a 3 in the first column, the ball will exit immediately.\n       Example: \n       Input: \n       2 2 1\n       1 3\n       2 2\n", "Round_0": {"code": "def dropping_balls():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    m = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    k = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        row = list(map(int, data[index:index + m]))\n        grid.append(row)\n        index += m\n    \n    ball_positions = list(map(int, data[index:index + k]))\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for start_col in ball_positions:\n        x, y = 0, start_col - 1\n        \n        while x < n and y >= 0 and y < m:\n            direction = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 2  # Change direction to down after leaving the cell\n            \n            if direction == 1:\n                y += 1\n            elif direction == 2:\n                x += 1\n            elif direction == 3:\n                y -= 1\n        \n        results.append(y + 1)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\ndropping_balls()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 86)"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def dropping_balls():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    m = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    k = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        row = list(map(int, data[index:index + m]))\n        grid.append(row)\n        index += m\n    \n    ball_positions = list(map(int, data[index:index + k]))\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for start_col in ball_positions:\n        x, y = 0, start_col - 1\n        \n        while x < n and y >= 0 and y < m:\n            direction = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 2  # Change direction to down after leaving the cell\n            \n            if direction == 1:\n                y += 1\n            elif direction == 2:\n                x += 1\n            elif direction == 3:\n                y -= 1\n        \n        results.append(y + 1)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\ndropping_balls()\n"}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract grid dimensions, grid data, and ball drop positions.\",\n      \"details\": \"Read the input values for n, m, k, the grid matrix, and the list of columns where balls are dropped.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Simulate the movement of a single ball through the grid.\",\n      \"details\": \"Implement logic to move a ball based on the direction specified in each cell, updating the cell's direction to '2' when a ball leaves it.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine the final column position for each ball after it exits the grid.\",\n      \"details\": \"Track the column index as the ball moves through the grid and record the column index when the ball exits the grid.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Repeat the simulation for each ball dropped.\",\n      \"details\": \"Iterate over the list of initial column positions and apply the ball movement simulation for each one.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Output the final column positions for all balls.\",\n      \"details\": \"Collect the results from each simulation and print them in the required format.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Parse the input to extract grid dimensions, grid data, and ball drop positions.\",\n    \"For each ball starting column, simulate the ball's movement through the grid:\",\n    \"  - Start from the first row and the given column.\",\n    \"  - Move the ball according to the direction in the current cell.\",\n    \"  - Update the cell's direction to '2' after the ball leaves it.\",\n    \"  - Continue moving the ball until it exits the grid.\",\n    \"  - Record the column index where the ball exits.\",\n    \"Output the recorded column indices for all balls in the order they were dropped.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid', 'ball movement', 'direction change'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves simulating the movement of balls through a grid where each cell has a direction that dictates the ball's movement. The direction can change to '2' once a ball leaves a cell, indicating a downward movement.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': The grid can have up to 1000 rows and columns.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n    '1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3': Each cell in the grid can have a direction value between 1 and 3.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': The starting column for each ball is within the grid's column range.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the movement of a single ball and updating the grid should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the logic to move the ball and update the cell's direction should be in the same loop to ensure the grid is updated correctly as the ball moves.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Grid with only one row and one column (1x1 grid), ball dropped in that column:\n       Input: 1 1 1\n              1\n              1\n       Output: 2\n       Explanation: The ball moves right and exits the grid immediately.\n\n    2. Grid with maximum size (1000x1000) and all cells initially directing right:\n       Input: 1000 1000 1\n              (1000 lines of 1000 '1's)\n              1\n       Output: 1001\n       Explanation: The ball moves right through all columns and exits the grid.\n\n    3. Ball dropped in a column where the first cell directs left (invalid by constraints but interesting for robustness):\n       Input: 1 2 1\n              3 1\n              1\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: The ball cannot move left from the first column, so it exits immediately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
