{"name": "1582_C. Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf", "description": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "tags": ["brute

asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not. Ensure that you only choose letters that enhance the chances of forming a palindrome.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome.

The original logic of checking each character and using two pointers to determine if a palindrome can be formed will naturally handle these cases.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_deletions_to_palindrome(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n\n    for n, s in test_cases:\n        def can_form_palindrome_by_removing(char):\n            left, right = 0, n - 1\n            deletions = 0\n\n            while left < right:\n                if s[left] == s[right]:\n                    left += 1\n                    right -= 1\n                elif s[left] == char:\n                    left += 1\n                    deletions += 1\n                elif s[right] == char:\n                    right -= 1\n                    deletions += 1\n                else:\n                    return float('inf')  # Impossible to form palindrome\n\n            return deletions\n\n        unique_chars = set(s)\n        min_deletions = float('inf')\n\n        for char in unique_chars:\n            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, can_form_palindrome_by_removing(char))\n\n        if min_deletions == float('inf'):\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            results.append(min_deletions)\n\n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n        index += 2\n\n    results = min_deletions_to_palindrome(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases and the corresponding strings.\",\n      \"details\": \"Read the integer t, followed by reading n and the string s for each test case.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if a string can be transformed into a palindrome by removing occurrences of a single character.\",\n      \"details\": \"For each string, check if removing occurrences of any single character can result in a palindrome.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Calculate the minimum number of characters to erase to form a palindrome.\",\n      \"details\": \"For each character that can be removed to form a palindrome, calculate the number of removals required and track the minimum.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Output the result for each test case.\",\n      \"details\": \"For each test case, output the minimum number of characters to erase or -1 if it's impossible.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Read the number of test cases, t.\",\n    \"For each test case, perform the following steps:\",\n    \"  a.

The requirement is to transform the given string into a palindrome by removing occurrences of a single character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum number of erased symbols'\n    Explanation: This means we need to find the smallest number of characters that can be removed to make the string a palindrome. In code, this involves iterating over possible characters to remove and calculating the number of removals needed for each.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: We need to find the least number of characters to erase to achieve a palindrome. This can be implemented by keeping track of the smallest count of removals across all possible characters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Steps 3 and 4 should be considered simultaneously.\n    \"Calculate the minimum number of characters to erase to form a palindrome.\"\n    \"Output the result for each test case.\"\n    These steps can be implemented together by iterating over each character, calculating the removals, and immediately storing the result for output.\n\n# [edge case]\n    abcaacab = 2\n    Explanation: Removing the first and last 'a' results in 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome.\n    xyzxyz = -1\n    Explanation: No single character removal can make this string a palindrome.\n    abba = 0\n    Explanation: The string is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Code for handling the edge case:\n    ```python\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    def min_removals_to_palindrome(s):\n        if is_palindrome(s):\n            return 0\n        min_removals = float('inf')\n        for char in set(s):\n            filtered = ''.join(c for c in s if c != char)\n            if is_palindrome(filtered):\n                min_removals = min(min_removals, len(s) - len(filtered))\n        return min_removals if min_removals != float('inf') else -1\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_removals_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    min_removals = float('inf')\n    for char in set(s):\n        filtered = ''.join(c for c in s if c != char)\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(s) - len(filtered))\n    return min_removals if min_removals != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        result = min_removals_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: min_removals_to_palindrome() missing 1 required positional argument: 's'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_removals_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    min_removals = float('inf')\n    for char in set(s):\n        filtered = ''.join(c for c in s if c != char)\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(s) - len(filtered))\n    return min_removals if min_removals != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        result = min_removals_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 201, "prompt": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
