{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops changing.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5\n2 4 1 5 3\n5\n5 3 2 4 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nNote\n\nConsider the fist example.\n\n  * The first eversion: a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3], x = 3. [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. \n  * The second and following eversions: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], x = 5. [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the second example. \n\n  * The first eversion: a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1], x = 1. [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]. \n  * The second eversion: a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], x = 4. [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. \n  * The third and following eversions: a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], x = 5. [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 2.

Elements less than or equal to x form the left part, and elements greater than x form the right part. The array is then reformed by concatenating the left and right parts.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'not greater than (\u2264)': This indicates that elements in the left part of the partition should be less than or equal to x.\n    'strictly greater than (>)': This indicates that elements in the right part of the partition should be greater than x.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum number': This refers to the smallest number of eversions required for the array to stop changing.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for parsing input and performing eversions should be implemented in sequence. However, the eversion operation itself (partitioning and concatenating) should be implemented simultaneously within a loop that checks for changes in the array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 0\n       Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no eversions are needed.\n    2. Input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] = 0\n       Explanation: All elements are the same, so the array does not change after any eversion.\n    3. Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] = 1\n       Explanation: The first eversion will sort the array, and no further eversions will change it.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the array changes after an eversion will naturally handle these cases.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def perform_eversion(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    x = a[-1]\n    left = [num for num in a if num <= x]\n    right = [num for num in a if num > x]\n    return left + right\n\ndef min_eversions_to_stabilize(a):\n    current_array = a[:]\n    k = 0\n    while True:\n        new_array = perform_eversion(current_array)\n        if new_array == current_array:\n            break\n        current_array = new_array\n        k += 1\n    return k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        result = min_eversions_to_stabilize(a)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 587, "prompt": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation where x = a_n, partitioning array a into left and right parts such that left contains elements not greater than x (\u2264 x) and right contains elements strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i.e. the partition is stable; then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array.
