You can select an element from the given sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements; for example, if you take out the 3-rd element from the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the resulting sequence will be [4, 2, 1]. You aim to delete some elements from a to increase f(a) to its maximum, using zero or more operations. Determine the largest possible f(a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "save_node": true, "parent_index": 148}
