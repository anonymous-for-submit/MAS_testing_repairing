{"name": "1600_F. Party Organization", "description": "On the great island of Baltia, there live N people, numbered from 1 to N. There are exactly M pairs of people that are friends with each other. The people of Baltia want to organize a successful party, but they have very strict rules on what a party is and when the party is successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i. Two friends can not be in the list of friends twice (no pairs are repeated) and a person can be friends with themselves (U_i \u2260 V_i).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to organize a successful party, print 5 numbers indicating which 5 people should be invited to the party. If it's not possible to organize a successful party, print -1 instead. If there are multiple successful parties possible, print any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6 3\n1 4\n4 2\n5 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 3 5 6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1",

This can be done by iterating over each combination and checking the friendship conditions within the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 5 0\n    Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n    Explanation: With no friendships, any combination of 5 people will be a successful party where no two people are friends.\n\n    Input: 5 10\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: If all possible pairs are friends, no combination of 5 people can have none being friends, and not all can be friends due to the constraint of needing exactly 5 people.\n\n    Input: 6 15\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: If the number of friendships is such that all possible pairs among 6 people are friends, it is impossible to have a combination of 5 people where none are friends.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where either no friendships exist or all possible pairs are friends.\n    ```python\n    if M == 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, range(1, 6))))\n        return\n    if M >= (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    M = int(data[1])\n    \n    # Edge case handling\n    if M == 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, range(1, 6))))\n        return\n    if M >= (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    friendships = set()\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(M):\n        U_i = int(data[index])\n        V_i = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        friendships.add((U_i, V_i))\n        friendships.add((V_i, U_i))\n    \n    # Check all combinations of 5 people\n    for combo in combinations(range(1, N + 1), 5):\n        all_friends = True\n        no_friends = True\n        \n        for i in range(5):\n            for j in range(i + 1, 5):\n                if (combo[i], combo[j]) in friendships:\n                    no_friends = False\n                else:\n                    all_friends = False\n        \n        if all_friends or no_friends:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, combo)))\n            return\n    \n    print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 29, "prompt": "On the great island of Baltia, there live N people, numbered from 1 to N. There are exactly M pairs of people that are friends with each other. The inhabitants of Baltia are eager to throw a thriving party, but they adhere to very strict definitions of what constitutes a party and when it is deemed successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them).
