You have to perform q queries, with each query being of one of two types:\n\n  * \"1 x\" \u2014 add the element x to the end of the array; \n  * \"2 x y\" \u2014 replace all occurrences of x in the array with y. \n\nFind the resulting array after performing all the queries. Ensure that the solution efficiently handles the scenarios where the number of queries or data size is large.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line). Each query is of one of two types: \n\n  * \"1 x\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5); \n  * \"2 x y\" (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5). \n\n\n\nIt's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the first type.\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line, print k integers \u2014 the resulting array after performing all the queries, where k is the number of queries of the first type.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n1 3\n1 1\n2 1 2\n1 2\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 2 2 3 2 \n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n1 1\n2 2 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 1 \n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 1 4\n1 1\n1 4\n1 2\n2 2 4\n2 4 3\n1 2\n2 2 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 3 3 7 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the array changes as follows:\n\n[] \u2192 [3] \u2192 [3, 1] \u2192 [3, 2] \u2192 [3, 2, 2] \u2192 [3, 2, 2, 1] \u2192 [3, 2, 2, 1, 2] \u2192 [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\nIn the second example, the array changes as follows:\n\n[] \u2192 [1] \u2192 [1, 2] \u2192 [1, 2, 1] \u2192 [1, 2, 1].\n\nIn the third example, the array changes as follows:\n\n[] \u2192 [] \u2192 [1] \u2192 [1, 4] \u2192 [1, 4, 2] \u2192 [1, 4, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 3] \u2192 [1, 3, 3, 2] \u2192 [1, 3, 3, 7].", "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
