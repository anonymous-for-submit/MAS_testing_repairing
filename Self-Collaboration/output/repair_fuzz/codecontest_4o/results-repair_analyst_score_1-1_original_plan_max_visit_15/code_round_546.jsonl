{"name": "1579_C. Ticks", "description": "Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).\n\nCasimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \u2265 k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \u2265 k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 19) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.", "tags": ["greedy",

A grid where all cells are '*', but k is larger than the grid dimensions: The expected output is NO because it's impossible to form a tick of the required size.\n       Explanation: If k is larger than the grid dimensions, no tick can be formed that satisfies the size requirement.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the grid has", "Round_0": {"code": "def can_form_ticks(n, m, k, grid):\n    # Create a grid to mark cells that can be part of a valid tick\n    marked = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Iterate over each cell to check if it can be the center of a tick\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == '*':\n                # Check if a tick of size at least k can be formed with center at (i, j)\n                d = 0\n                while True:\n                    if i - d < 0 or j - d < 0 or j + d >= m:\n                        break\n                    if grid[i - d][j - d] != '*' or grid[i - d][j + d] != '*':\n                        break\n                    d += 1\n                d -= 1\n\n                # If a valid tick of size at least k is found, mark the cells\n                if d >= k:\n                    for h in range(d + 1):\n                        marked[i - h][j - h] = True\n                        marked[i - h][j + h] = True\n\n    # Validate the grid to ensure all '*' cells are part of a valid tick\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == '*' and not marked[i][j]:\n                return \"NO\"\n    return \"YES\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, m, k = map(int, data[index].split())\n        grid = [data[index + i + 1] for i in range(n)]\n        index += n + 1\n\n        result = can_form_ticks(n, m, k, grid)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases and the details for each test case including grid dimensions, minimum tick size, and grid pattern.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"Read the number of test cases.\",\n        \"For each test case, read the grid dimensions (n, m) and minimum tick size (k).\",\n        \"Read the grid pattern consisting of n lines with m characters each.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the grid can be formed by ticks of size at least k.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid.\",\n        \"Check if a tick of size at least k can be centered at each cell marked with '*'.\",\n        \"Ensure that all '*' cells can be part of a valid tick of size at least k.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Output the result for each test case.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"For each test case, output 'YES' if the grid can be formed by ticks of size at least k, otherwise output 'NO'.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases and details for each test case.\",\n    \"For each test case, analyze the grid to determine if it can be formed by ticks of size at least k.\",\n    \"Output the result for each test case based on the analysis.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular sheet of paper with a grid pattern': This refers to the grid structure where operations are performed.\n    'tick of size d': A pattern that involves painting cells in a specific diagonal manner.\n    'center cell': The focal point of the tick from which the pattern extends.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves determining if a grid pattern can be formed using specific tick patterns, where each tick has a center and extends diagonally.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'd > 0': Indicates that the tick size must be greater than zero.\n    '2d + 1 black cells': Specifies the number of cells painted black for a tick of size d.\n    'd \u2265 k': The size of each tick must be at least k.\n    Explanation: These phrases define constraints on the tick sizes and the number of cells involved in forming a tick.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented simultaneously when checking if a tick can be centered at each cell marked with '*'.

Initially, every cell in the grid is white. Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j); the top-left cell will be called (1, 1), and the bottom-right cell as (n, m). Casimir draws ticks of various sizes on the grid. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 1. The center cell (i, j) is painted black first. 2. Then exactly d cells diagonally from the top-left to the center and exactly d cells diagonally from the top-right to the center are also painted black. 3. Essentially, all cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for each h ranging from 0 to d are painted, and in particular, a tick has 2d + 1 black cells. An already painted cell will stay black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3. <image> You are given a portrayal of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m.
