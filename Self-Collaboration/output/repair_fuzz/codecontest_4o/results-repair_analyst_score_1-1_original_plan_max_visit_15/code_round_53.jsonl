{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",

inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'permutation'\n    Explanation: A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a particular order. In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Here, it is used to calculate the difference between the predicted ratings p and the new ratings q.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the new rating q_i for liked songs must be higher than q_j for disliked songs.\n    'minimum possible': This means that the sum of absolute differences between p and q should be as small as possible.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': Refers to finding the permutation q that results in the smallest sum of absolute differences between p and q.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings should be implemented simultaneously to ensure the permutation q is valid and satisfies the condition q_i > q_j for liked and disliked songs. This can be done by sorting and assigning ratings in a single loop or block.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: All songs are liked (e.g., s = \"111\")\n    Expected output: The permutation q should be the same as p because the sum of absolute differences will be zero.\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, any permutation is valid, but the one equal to p minimizes the sum of differences.\n\n    Case 2: All songs are disliked (e.g., s = \"000\")\n    Expected output: Any permutation q is valid, but the one equal to p minimizes the sum of differences.\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, the permutation equal to p will have the smallest sum of differences.\n\n    Case 3: Alternating likes and dislikes (e.g., s = \"101010\")\n    Expected output: Liked songs should have higher ratings than disliked songs, and the permutation should minimize the sum of differences.\n    Explanation: The permutation should be constructed such that liked songs have higher ratings than disliked songs, while minimizing the sum of absolute differences.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings will naturally handle these cases.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n

 'permutation'\n    Explanation: A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a particular order. In this context, it means that the predicted ratings and the new ratings must both be rearrangements of the numbers from 1 to n, with each number appearing exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value without regard to its sign. Here, it is used to calculate the difference between predicted and new ratings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the new rating for liked songs must be higher than the new rating for disliked songs. In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that the indices of liked songs in the new permutation are assigned higher values than those of disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This refers to finding the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between predicted and new ratings. In code, this can be implemented by sorting and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes these differences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Steps 3 and 4 should be considered simultaneously. Sorting the liked and disliked songs and then assigning new ratings should be done in a single process to ensure that the constraints are met efficiently.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: All songs liked\n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 111\n    Expected Output: 3 1 2\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences is the same as the predicted ratings.\n\n    Case 2: All songs disliked\n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 000\n    Expected Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences is the same as the predicted ratings.\n\n    Case 3: Alternating likes and dislikes\n    Input: 4, 4 3 2 1, 1010\n    Expected Output: 4 1 3 2\n    Explanation: Liked songs (1, 3) get the highest ratings (4, 3), and disliked songs (2, 4) get the lowest ratings (1, 2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Here, it is used to calculate the difference between the predicted ratings p and the new ratings q.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the new rating q_i for liked songs must be higher than q_j for disliked songs.\n    'minimum possible': This means that the sum of absolute differences between p and q should be as small as possible.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': Refers to finding the permutation q that results in the smallest sum of absolute differences between p and q.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings should be implemented simultaneously to ensure the permutation q is valid and satisfies the condition q_i > q_j for liked and disliked songs. This can be done by sorting and assigning ratings in a single loop or block.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: All songs are liked (e.g., s = \"111\")\n    Expected output: The permutation q should be the same as p because the sum of absolute differences will be zero.\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, any permutation is valid, but the one equal to p minimizes the sum of differences.\n\n    Case 2: All songs are disliked (e.g., s = \"000\")\n    Expected output: Any permutation q is valid, but the one equal to p minimizes the sum of differences.\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, the permutation equal to p will have the smallest sum of differences.\n\n    Case 3: Alternating likes and dislikes (e.g., s = \"101010\")\n    Expected output: Liked songs should have higher ratings than disliked songs, and the permutation should minimize the sum of differences.\n    Explanation: The permutation should be constructed such that liked songs have higher ratings than disliked songs, while minimizing the sum of absolute differences.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
