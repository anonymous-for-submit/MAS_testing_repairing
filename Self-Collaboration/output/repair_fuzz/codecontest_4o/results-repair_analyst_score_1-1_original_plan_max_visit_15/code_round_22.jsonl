{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate. Contradiction.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output.

of other players.\n    'crewmate': A player who always tells the truth about the role of other players.\n    'contradict': A situation where the comments made by players lead to logical inconsistencies.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This indicates that we need to find the highest number of imposters that can be logically assigned based on the comments without contradictions.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This means we need to find the largest possible count of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to assign roles to each player based on comments.\"\n    - \"Check for contradictions during traversal: if a player is assigned a role that conflicts with a previous assignment, mark the test case as contradictory.\"\n    These can be implemented in a single traversal loop where roles are assigned and contradictions are checked concurrently.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: With no comments, there are no contradictions, and all players can be imposters.\n    \n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, leading to a logical inconsistency, so the output is -1.\n    \n    Test case with all players claiming others are imposters (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 imposter\", \"2 3 imposter\", \"3 1 imposter\") = 3\n    Explanation: If all players claim others are imposters, they can all be imposters without contradiction.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, particularly for detecting contradictions and handling cases with no comments.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(n, m, comments):\n        if m == 0:\n            return n\n        # Implement graph traversal and contradiction detection logic\n        # Initialize roles and perform DFS/BFS to assign roles and check contradictions\n        # Return -1 if contradictions are found, otherwise return the count of imposters\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def solve_among_them():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t =

The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on the comments made by players.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This means we need to find the highest count of imposters that can be logically deduced from the comments without contradictions.\n    'at least': This phrase is not explicitly in the requirement but is implied in the logic of determining roles based on comments.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the largest possible number of imposters that can be deduced from the comments.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking contradictions and calculating the maximum number of imposters should be considered simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Iterate over each comment and update the roles of players based on the comment.\"\n    - \"Check for contradictions in comments, where a player is both claimed to be a crewmate and an imposter.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single loop where each comment is processed, and contradictions are checked immediately.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no contradictions, so all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, making it impossible to determine roles without contradiction.\n    3. Test case with all players claiming others as imposters (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 3 imposter, 3 1 imposter) = 2\n       Explanation: The maximum number of imposters can be 2, as one player must be a crewmate to validate the claims.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, especially for detecting contradictions.\n    ```\n    def detect_contradictions_and_calculate_max_imposters(comments, n):\n        roles = {}  #
