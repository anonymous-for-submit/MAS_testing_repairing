{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

If he does not answer correctly, he gets 0 points. Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible.

For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not. \n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points. If he does not answer correctly, he gets 0 points. Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. The distribution of points follows a specific configuration, ensuring that every number from 1 to m is used exactly once.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be.

The goal is to find a permutation that maximizes the surprise value.\n\n    'surprise value'\n    Explanation: The surprise value is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the expected points and the actual points received by each student. The task is to maximize this value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the goal is to find the permutation that results in the highest possible surprise value. In code, this means iterating over all permutations and selecting the one with the highest calculated surprise value.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This refers to the largest possible surprise value that can be achieved with any permutation of points. In code, this involves comparing calculated surprise values and keeping track of the largest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented in sequence, but the calculation of the surprise value for each permutation and the selection of the maximum should be done in a loop that iterates over all permutations.
