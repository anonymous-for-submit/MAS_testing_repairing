{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The flower's height changes depending on whether it is watered or not, and it can die if not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n    Implementation: Use a loop to check consecutive days in the list. If two consecutive days have a value of 0, set the height to -1.\n\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment the height by 1 if the current day is watered (a_i = 1) and the previous day wasn't (a_(i-1) = 0).\n\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment the height by 5 if both the current day and the previous day are watered (a_i = 1 and a_(i-1) = 1).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to checking consecutive watering or non-watering days should be implemented simultaneously within the loop that iterates over the days.

The flower's height changes depending on whether it is watered or not, and it can die if not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n    Implementation: Use a loop to check consecutive days in the list. If two consecutive days have a value of 0, set the height to -1.\n\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment the height by 1 if the current day is watered (a_i = 1) and the previous day wasn't (a_(i-1) = 0).\n\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment the height by 5 if both the current day and the previous day are watered (a_i = 1 and a_(i-1) = 1).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to checking consecutive watering or non-watering days should be implemented simultaneously within the loop that iterates over the days. This involves checking the conditions for growth or death in a single iteration block.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with all days watered: [1, 1, 1, 1] = 16\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm each day after the first, resulting in a total height of 1 + 5*3 = 16 cm.\n\n    Test case with alternating watering: [1, 0, 1, 0] = 3\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 1 cm on each watered day, resulting in a total height of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 cm.\n\n    Test case with no watering: [0, 0, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower dies after the first two days without watering, resulting in a height of -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n == 1 and a[0] == 0:\n            return -1\n        height = 1", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        if n == 1 and a[0] == 0:\n            results.append(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        height = 1\n        consecutive_no_water = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                if i > 0 and a[i - 1] == 1:\n                    height += 5\n                else:\n                    height += 1\n                consecutive_no_water = 0\n            else:\n                consecutive_no_water += 1\n                if consecutive_no_water == 2:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n        \n        results.append(height)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 241, "prompt": "Petya is a busy person and as a result, he sometimes forgets to water it.
