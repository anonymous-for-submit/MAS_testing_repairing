{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The trajectory is the path that the ball takes as it moves through the grid, determined by the values in each cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Indicates the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Indicates the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n    Explanation: These phrases define the constraints on the grid size and the number of balls, which are important for understanding the limits within which the solution must operate. In code, these constraints help in setting up loops and data structures efficiently.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Simulate the movement of each ball through the grid based on the predefined directions\" and \"Determine the exit column for each ball after it leaves the grid\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by simulating the ball's movement in a loop until it exits the grid, updating the grid and tracking the exit column in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           2\n           1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: The grid is of size 1x1, and the ball moves down immediately, exiting the grid from the same column it was dropped.\n    \n    Input: 2 2 1\n           1 3\n           2 2\n           1\n    Output: 2\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 1, moves right to column 2, then moves down and exits from column 2.\n    \n    Input: 3 3 1\n           1 1 3\n           2 2 2\n           2 2 2\n           3\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 3, moves left to column 2, then moves down and exits from column 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
