{"name": "1600_J. Robot Factory", "description": "You have received data from a Bubble bot. You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct. \n\nYour task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.

The order of bits corresponds to North, East, South, and West.\n\n    'connected components (rooms)'\n    Explanation: Rooms are formed by connected tiles without walls blocking the path between them. Identifying these components involves checking the binary representation of each tile.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'largest to smallest'\n    Explanation: The output requires sorting the room sizes from the largest to the smallest. This can be implemented using a sorting algorithm on the list of room sizes.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'largest'\n    Explanation: Refers to the biggest room size in terms of the number of tiles it contains. Sorting the room sizes in descending order will achieve this.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for parsing the input and converting tile values to binary representation can be implemented simultaneously as they are straightforward and sequential. However, identifying rooms and calculating their sizes should be handled separately due to the complexity of the flood fill algorithm.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1\n           0\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: A single tile with no walls blocking any side forms one room of size 1.\n\n    Input: 2 2\n           15 15\n           15 15\n    Output: 1 1 1 1\n    Explanation: Each tile is isolated by walls on all sides, resulting in four rooms of size 1.\n\n    Input: 3 3\n           0 0 0\n           0 0 0\n           0 0 0\n    Output: 9\n    Explanation: All tiles are connected without any walls, forming one large room of size 9.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
