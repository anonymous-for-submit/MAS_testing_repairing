{"name": "1618_B. Missing Bigram", "description": "Polycarp has come up with a new game to play with you. He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it.\n\nFor example, word \"abbaaba\" contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. Then, he writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. After that, he wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'. It should be possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n7\nab bb ba aa ba\n7\nab ba aa ab ba\n3\naa\n5\nbb ab bb\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nabbaaba\nabaabaa\nbaa\nbbabb\n\nNote\n\nThe first two testcases from the example are produced from the word \"abbaaba\". As listed in the statement, it contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nIn the first testcase, the 5-th bigram is removed. \n\nIn the second testcase, the 2-nd bigram is removed. However, that sequence could also have been produced from the word \"abaabaa\". It contains bigrams \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\" and \"aa\". The missing bigram is the 6-th one.\n\nIn the third testcase, all of \"baa\", \"aab\" and \"aaa\" are valid answers.", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1618, "sample_io": [{"input":

In this requirement, the bigrams are used to reconstruct the original word by identifying the sequence of these pairs.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n-2 bigrams'\n    This indicates that for a word of length n, there are n-2 bigrams provided, meaning one bigram is missing from the complete sequence. In code, this means we need to reconstruct a word of length n using the given n-2 bigrams.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps to reconstruct the word from bigrams should be implemented simultaneously:\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the reconstructed word.\n    - For each bigram in the sequence, append the first character of the bigram to the list if it is not already the last character in the list.\n    - After processing all bigrams, append the second character of the last bigram to complete the word.\n    These steps can be implemented in a single loop iterating over the bigrams.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with minimum length:\n    Input: 3, aa\n    Output: aaa\n    Explanation: With only one bigram 'aa', the word can be 'aaa' since it satisfies the condition of having one missing bigram.\n\n    Test case with all same bigrams:\n    Input: 5, aa aa aa\n    Output: aaaa\n    Explanation: The word 'aaaa' can be formed with the bigrams 'aa', 'aa', 'aa', and one missing 'aa'.\n\n    Test case with alternating bigrams:\n    Input: 5, ab ba ab\n    Output: ababa\n    Explanation: The word 'ababa' can be formed with the bigrams 'ab', 'ba', 'ab', and one missing 'ba'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it.\n\nFor instance, the word \"abbaaba\" includes bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. Then, he writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. After that, he wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists.

Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'.

However, that sequence could also have been produced from the word \"abaabaa\". It contains bigrams \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\" and \"aa\".
