{"name": "1615_A. Closing The Gap", "description": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. \n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3. The new heights will now be [2, 2, 2, 2], with an ugliness of 0.\n\nIn the third test case, you may do three operations: \n\n  1. with i = 3 and j = 1. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 1, 5], \n  2. with i = 5 and j = 4. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 2, 4], \n  3. with i = 5 and j = 3. The new array will now be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nThe resulting ugliness is 1. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1615, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1

min(a).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum possible ugliness': This means we need to find the smallest value of max(a) - min(a) after redistributing blocks between towers.\n    'any number of days': This implies that there is no limit to the number of operations we can perform to achieve the minimum ugliness.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This indicates that we need to achieve the smallest possible value of ugliness, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum heights of the towers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to calculating the minimum possible ugliness should be considered simultaneously:\n    - \"Find the maximum and minimum height of the towers.\"\n    - \"Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum height.\"\n    - \"Determine if the difference can be reduced to zero by redistributing blocks between towers.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single loop or function that processes each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with all towers having the same height: \n       Input: 1\n              3\n              5 5 5\n       Expected output: 0\n       Explanation: All towers are already of the same height, so the ugliness is 0.\n\n    2. Test case with two towers of different heights:\n       Input: 1\n              2\n              1 10\n       Expected output: 0\n       Explanation: We can move blocks from the taller tower to the shorter one until both are equal.\n\n    3. Test case with maximum height difference:\n       Input: 1\n              3\n              1 1 10000000\n       Expected output: 0\n       Explanation: We can redistribute blocks to make all towers equal in height.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of finding the max and min heights and redistributing blocks to equalize them will handle these cases.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def minimum_ugliness(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, heights in test_cases:\n        max_height = max(heights)\n        min_height = min(heights)\n        # Calculate the total number of blocks\n        total_blocks = sum(heights)\n        # Calculate the average height\n        average_height = total_blocks // n\n        # If the total number of blocks is divisible by n, we can make all towers equal\n        if total_blocks % n == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, the minimum ugliness is 1\n            results.append(1)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        heights = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, heights))\n    \n    results = minimum_ugliness(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 656, "prompt": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i.
