{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

A 'contradiction' occurs when the statements made by players cannot logically coexist, indicating an inconsistency in the roles assigned based on the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of imposters': This means we need to find the highest count of players that can be imposters without causing contradictions in the comments.\n    'at least': This phrase is not explicitly in the requirement but is implied in the need to ensure that the number of imposters is maximized while maintaining logical consistency.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the largest possible number of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps involving graph construction and contradiction checking should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, while constructing the graph, we can simultaneously check for contradictions using a graph traversal method like DFS or BFS. This allows for efficient role assignment and contradiction detection in one pass through the graph.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    2.

The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters or identify contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This means finding the highest count of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions. In code, this involves exploring all valid role assignments and selecting the one with the most imposters.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This indicates the need to find the largest possible number of imposters. In code, this can be implemented by evaluating all possible configurations and selecting the one with the highest count of imposters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph construction and contradiction checking should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - Constructing the graph and checking for contradictions can be done in a single traversal using DFS or BFS. This involves assigning roles and checking for consistency in one pass through the graph.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with a single contradictory comment (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, making it impossible to assign roles without conflict.\n    3. Test case with all players claiming each other as imposters (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 3 imposter, 3 1 imposter) = 2\n       Explanation: A valid assignment is possible with two imposters and one crewmate, as long as the roles are consistent.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to handle cases with no comments and direct contradictions:\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(n, m, comments):\n        if m == 0:\n            return n\n        #
