{"name": "1598_B. Groups", "description": "n students attended the first meeting of the Berland SU programming course (n is even). All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.\n\nEach student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not. \n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to choose two different week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of t testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains 5 integers, each of them is 0 or 1. If the j-th integer is 1, then the i-th student can attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. If the j-th integer is 0, then the i-th student cannot attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. \n\nAdditional constraints on the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is convenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to divide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days for the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of their group, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n4\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n2\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there is a way to meet all the constraints. For example, the first group can consist of the first and the third students, they will attend the lessons on Thursday (the fourth day); the second group can consist of the second and the fourth students, and they will attend the lessons on Tuesday (the second day).\n\nIn the second testcase, it is impossible to divide the students into groups so they attend the lessons on different days.",

concept]\n    'even number'\n    Explanation: The number of students, n, is always even, which ensures that they can be divided into two equal groups.\n\n    'convenient'\n    Explanation: A day is convenient for a student if they have marked it with a 1, meaning they are available to attend a lesson on that day.\n\n    'different days'\n    Explanation: The two groups must attend lessons on different weekdays.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'equal sizes': The two groups must have the same number of students, which is n/2 for each group.\n    Implementation: Ensure that the number of students in each group is exactly n/2.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the second subproblem should be implemented simultaneously:\n    - \"For each test case, iterate over all pairs of weekdays (i, j) where i != j.\"\n    - \"For each pair of weekdays, count the number of students who can attend on each of the two days.\"\n    - \"Check if it is possible to divide the students into two groups of equal size such that one group attends on day i and the other on day j.\"\n    These steps can be combined into a nested loop structure where you iterate over pairs of days and check the conditions in one go.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. n = 2, availability = [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]] = NO\n       Explanation: Each student is only available on a different day, making it impossible to form two groups with different days.\n    \n    2. n = 4, availability = [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]] = YES\n       Explanation: The first two students can attend on either of the first two days, and the last two on either of the last two days, allowing a valid division.\n    \n    3. n =

All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.\n\nEach student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not. \n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to select two separate weekdays to arrange the lessons for the groups (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient. Ensure the solution considers all possible combinations of weekdays while adhering to the constraints.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of t testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains 5 integers, each of them is 0 or 1.
