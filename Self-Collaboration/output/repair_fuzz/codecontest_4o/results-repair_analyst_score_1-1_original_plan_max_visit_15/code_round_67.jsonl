{"name": "1606_A. AB Balance", "description": "You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b.\n\nLet \\operatorname{AB}(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in s as a substring. Analogically, \\operatorname{BA}(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in s as a substring.\n\nIn one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s)?\n\nReminder:\n\nThe number of occurrences of string d in s as substring is the number of indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s| - |d| + 1) such that substring s_i s_{i + 1} ... s_{i + |d| - 1} is equal to d. For example, \\operatorname{AB}(aabbbabaa) = 2 since there are two indices i: i = 2 where aabbbabaa and i = 6 where aabbbabaa.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the resulting string s with \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nb\naabbbabaa\nbbbb\nabbaaa\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.\n\nIn the second test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. \n\nIn the third test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.\n\nIn the fourth test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.", "tags": ["strings"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1606, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n", "output":

The task is to make these counts equal with the minimum number of character replacements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum number of steps'\n    Explanation: This means the fewest possible character changes needed to make the counts of \"ab\" and \"ba\" equal. In code, this involves calculating the difference between the counts and making the necessary replacements to balance them.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps to calculate occurrences and determine the minimum steps to balance should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, after counting \"ab\" and \"ba\", the logic to decide if changes are needed and how many should be in the same code block to efficiently determine the solution.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: s = \"aaaa\" -> Output: \"aaaa\"\n    Explanation: Both AB(s) and BA(s) are 0, so no changes are needed.\n\n    Case 2: s = \"abab\" -> Output: \"abab\"\n    Explanation: AB(s) = 2 and BA(s) = 1, so one change is needed. Change the last 'b' to 'a' to make it \"abaa\" or change the first 'a' to 'b' to make it \"bbab\".\n\n    Case 3: s = \"baba\" -> Output: \"baba\"\n    Explanation: AB(s) = 1 and BA(s) = 2, so one change is needed. Change the last 'a' to 'b' to make it \"babb\" or change the first 'b' to 'a' to make it \"aaba\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
