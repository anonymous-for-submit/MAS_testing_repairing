In this requirement, odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending order (like a dictionary), and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending order (reverse dictionary order).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to defining and applying the custom sorting function should be implemented simultaneously.
