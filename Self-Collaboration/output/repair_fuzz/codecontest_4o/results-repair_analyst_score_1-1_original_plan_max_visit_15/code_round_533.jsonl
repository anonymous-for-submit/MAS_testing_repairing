{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

It consists of n rows and m columns.\n\n    'portal'\n    Explanation: A sub-rectangle within the main grid that meets specific conditions, including having a boundary of obsidian blocks and an interior of empty blocks.\n\n    'operation'\n    Explanation: The action of changing a block from obsidian to empty or vice versa.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5, b \u2265 4'\n    Explanation: The dimensions of the portal must be at least 5 rows and 4 columns. In code, this can be implemented by ensuring any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions that meet or exceed these values.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the smallest number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves keeping track of the least number of changes required across all possible sub-rectangles.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan are mostly sequential, but the calculation of operations for each sub-rectangle and the determination of the minimum number of operations could be considered simultaneously in a nested loop structure. This involves iterating over possible sub-rectangles and calculating the required operations in one go.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. A grid where all blocks are already in the portal configuration.\n       Explanation: The expected output is 0 operations since no changes are needed.\n    2. A grid where all blocks are obsidian.\n       Explanation: The expected output would be the maximum number of changes needed to create a portal, as all interior blocks need to be changed to empty.\n    3. A grid where all blocks are empty.\n       Explanation: The expected output would be the number of changes needed to create the obsidian boundary.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to ensure that the code can handle grids that are already in the desired configuration or require maximum changes. This involves checking the initial state of the grid and potentially short-circuiting the operation count if no changes are needed.\n\n    Example code snippet for handling edge cases:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_operations(grid, n, m):\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        for a in range(5, n+1):\n            for b in range(4, m", "Round_0": {"code": "def calculate_operations(grid, n, m):\n    min_operations = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n    for start_row in range(n):\n        for start_col in range(m):\n            # Iterate over all possible dimensions a and b\n            for a in range(5, n -
