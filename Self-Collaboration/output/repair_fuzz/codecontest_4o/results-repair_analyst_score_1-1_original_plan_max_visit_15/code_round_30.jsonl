{"name": "1600_J. Robot Factory", "description": "You have received data from a Bubble bot. You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges.

The task is to determine the size of rooms formed by these walls.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'from largest to tiniest': This indicates that the room sizes need to be sorted in descending order.\n    Implementation: Use a sorting function to order the room sizes from largest to smallest.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'largest', 'tiniest': These terms specify the order in which room sizes should be output.\n    Implementation: Use a sorting function to ensure the list of room sizes is in descending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for parsing input, converting tile numbers to binary, and determining wall positions should be implemented simultaneously as they are closely related.

You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you examine the data, you realize that you have the measurements of the construction, which is in rectangular shape: N x M.\n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges.
