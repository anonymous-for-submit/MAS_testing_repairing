{"name": "1579_A. Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

This means we need to check if count('A') == count('B') + count('C').\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'fewest': This indicates that the solution should aim to minimize the number of actions, but in this context, it is more about checking a condition rather than performing actions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"For each string, count the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C'\" and \"Check if the number of 'A's is equal to the sum of the number of 'B's and 'C's\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done in a single loop where you count the occurrences and check the condition.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: \"A\" = NO\n    Explanation: There is only one 'A' and no 'B' or 'C', so the condition is not met.\n    \n    Case 2: \"BC\" = NO\n    Explanation: There are no 'A's, so the condition cannot be met.\n    \n    Case 3: \"ABC\" = YES\n    Explanation: The number of 'A's (1) is equal to the sum of 'B's (1) and 'C's (1).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
