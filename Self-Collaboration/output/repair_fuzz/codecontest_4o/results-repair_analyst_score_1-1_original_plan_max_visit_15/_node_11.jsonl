Instead, it permits you to extract any segment of the provided array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset, and reintegrate it back into the identical position.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions:\n\n  1. You have the option to choose any indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the segment's limits.\n  2. The segment a[l \u2026 r] is then replaced with a cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. Cyclic shift is also illustrated by these relations: the series [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 1, and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 2.\n\nFor instance, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then selecting l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 results in a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is subsequently shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you obtain a segment [8, 3, 2] that then replaces the original elements of the segment. Finally, you have a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nArrange the given array a utilizing no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. It's important to mention that you don't need to reduce the number of cyclic shifts. Any approach using n or fewer cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2.

Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j), where the upper left cell is (1, 1) and the lower right cell is (n, m). Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted; in particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \u2265 k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \u2265 k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 19) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2.

requirement, a \"portal\" is a specific sub-rectangle configuration within a larger rectangle. It has specific conditions regarding the arrangement of obsidian and empty blocks, with obsidian blocks forming a border and empty blocks filling the interior, except for the corners which can be any type.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5, b \u2265 4': This means that the dimensions of the sub-rectangle (portal) must be at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    Implementation: Ensure that when iterating over possible sub-rectangles, only consider those with dimensions meeting these minimum requirements.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This refers to finding the smallest number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal.\n    Implementation: Track the number of operations for each sub-rectangle and update the minimum value found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking sub-rectangle conditions and calculating operations should be implemented simultaneously.

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    'sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400': This indicates a constraint on the total number of rows across all test cases, which can be used to optimize the code by limiting unnecessary computations.\n    'sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400': Similar to the constraint on n, this limits the total number of columns across all test cases.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': The goal is to find the least number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves comparing operation counts and selecting the smallest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Evaluate each sub-rectangle for portal conditions\" and \"Calculate operations needed for each sub-rectangle\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating over each sub-rectangle, checking its conditions, and calculating the required operations in a single loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Example: \n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions.\n\n    Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Case 3: A rectangle with alternating obsidian and empty blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    Output: 8\n    Explanation: Only the necessary border blocks"], "task_id": "codecontest/20"}
