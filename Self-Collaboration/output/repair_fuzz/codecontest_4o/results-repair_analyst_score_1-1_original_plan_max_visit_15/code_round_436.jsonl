{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

In code, this can be implemented by checking if the dimensions of sub-rectangles meet these criteria.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': Refers to the minimum number of operations needed to create a portal.\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the sub-rectangle that requires the least number of changes to become a portal. In code, this involves tracking the minimum operations across all sub-rectangles.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Check if a sub-rectangle is a valid portal\" and \"Calculate the number of operations needed to convert a sub-rectangle into a valid portal\" should be implemented simultaneously.\n    Explanation: While checking if a sub-rectangle is a valid portal, we can simultaneously count the operations needed to convert it into a portal.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already forms a portal.\n\n    Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Expected Output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be converted to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Case 3: A rectangle with dimensions smaller than the minimum portal size.\n    Input: \n    1\n    4 3\n    111\n    101\n    101\n    111\n    Expected Output: -1\n    Explanation: The rectangle is too small to form a portal, so", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_portal(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, grid in test_cases:\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible sub-rectangles of dimensions a by b\n        for a in range(5, n + 1):\n            for b in range(4, m + 1):\n                for start_row in range(n - a + 1):\n                    for start_col in range(m - b + 1):\n                        operations = 0\n                        # Check the borders and interior of the sub-rectangle\n                        for x in range(a):\n                            for y in range(b):\n                                current_block = grid[start_row + x][start_col + y]\n                                if (x == 0 or x == a - 1) and (y == 0 or y == b - 1):\n                                    # Corners can be any type, no operation needed\n                                    continue\n                                elif x == 0 or x == a - 1 or y == 0 or y == b - 1:\n                                    # Borders must be obsidian (1)\n                                    if current_block == '0':\n                                        operations += 1\n                                else:\n                                    # Interior must be empty (0)\n                                    if current_block == '1':\n                                        operations += 1\n                        \n                        # Update the minimum operations needed\n                        min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)\n        \n        # If no valid portal can be formed, return -1\n        if min_operations == float('inf'):\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            results.append(min_operations)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        test_cases.append((n, m, grid))\n    \n    results = min_operations_to_portal(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 436, "prompt": "CQXYM discovered a rectangle A with dimensions n by m, consisting of n rows with m columns of blocks, where each block can either be an obsidian block or empty, and CQXYM is able to convert an obsidian block to an empty block or vice versa in one operation.
