{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

The points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test.

The goal is to maximize this value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to find the permutation of points that results in the highest possible surprise value.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This refers to the highest possible value of the surprise value that can be achieved by any permutation of points.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to generating permutations and calculating surprise values should be considered simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Generate all possible permutations of points from 1 to m.\"\n    - \"Calculate the surprise value for each permutation using the formula \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single loop where each permutation is generated and evaluated for its surprise value.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: n = 1, m = 1, x = [0], s = [\"0\"]\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one question and the student expecting 0 points, the permutation is trivial, and the surprise value is maximized with any permutation.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 1, m = 10, x = [55], s = [\"1111111111\"]\n    Expected Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n    Explanation: The student expects the maximum possible score, and the permutation should be in descending order to maximize the surprise value.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 10, m = 1, x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], s = [\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one question and all students expecting 0 points, the permutation is trivial, and the surprise value is", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        x = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        s = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # To maximize the surprise value, we need to maximize the difference\n        # between expected and actual scores.
