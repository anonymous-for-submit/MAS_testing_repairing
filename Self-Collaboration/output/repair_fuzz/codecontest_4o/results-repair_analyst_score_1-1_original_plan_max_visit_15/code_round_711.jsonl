{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops changing.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5\n2 4 1 5 3\n5\n5 3 2 4 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nNote\n\nConsider the fist example.\n\n  * The first eversion: a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3], x = 3. [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. \n  * The second and following eversions: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], x = 5. [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the second example. \n\n  * The first eversion: a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1], x = 1. [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]. \n  * The second eversion: a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], x = 4. [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. \n  * The third and following eversions: a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], x = 5. [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 2.

The array is then replaced with the concatenation of these two parts.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'not greater than': means elements in the left part are less than or equal to \\( x \\).\n    'strictly greater than': means elements in the right part are greater than \\( x \\).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum number': means the smallest number of eversions required for the array to stop changing.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for performing the eversion operation and checking if the array changes should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the steps \"Perform the eversion operation on the array\" and \"Check if the array changes after the eversion\" should be in the same loop to efficiently determine when the array stops changing.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with already sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 0\n    Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no eversion is needed, and the number of eversions is 0.\n    \n    Test case with all elements the same: [2, 2, 2, 2] = 0\n    Explanation: Since all elements are the same, the array does not change after any eversion, so the number of eversions is 0.\n    \n    Test case with descending order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] = 1\n    Explanation: After one eversion, the array becomes [1, 5, 4, 3, 2], and no further eversions change the array, so the number of eversions is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
