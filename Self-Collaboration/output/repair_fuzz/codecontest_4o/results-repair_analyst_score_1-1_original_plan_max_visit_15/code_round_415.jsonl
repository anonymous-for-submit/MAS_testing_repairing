{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The growth rules are specific to consecutive watering and non-watering days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates a condition where the flower dies if not watered for two consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by checking pairs of consecutive days in the list.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This indicates the flower grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 1 when a day is watered.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This indicates the flower grows by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by checking if both the current and previous day are watered, then incrementing the height by 5.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to checking consecutive watering and non-watering days should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Check if the flower is watered on consecutive days to apply the special growth rule.\"\n    - \"Check if the flower is not watered for two consecutive days to determine if it dies.\"\n    These checks can be done in a single loop iterating over the list of days, using conditions to apply the growth or death rules.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 1 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it requires two consecutive days of non-watering to die.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 2 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 3 1 1 0\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the first two days due to consecutive watering, and does not grow on the third day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking consecutive days for watering and non-watering will naturally handle these scenarios.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def flower_growth(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, days in test_cases:\n        height = 1\n        consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if days[i] == 1:\n                if i > 0 and days[i - 1] == 1:\n                    height += 5\n                else:\n                    height += 1\n                consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n            else:\n                consecutive_unwatered_days += 1\n                if consecutive_unwatered_days == 2:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n        results.append(height)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        days = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, days))\n    \n    results = flower_growth(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, "session_historys": [{"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases and the details for each test case.\",\n      \"details\": \"Read the first line to get the number of test cases, t.
