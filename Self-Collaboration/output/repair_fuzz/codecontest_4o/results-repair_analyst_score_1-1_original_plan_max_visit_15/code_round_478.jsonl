{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

The boundary must be made of obsidian blocks, while the interior (except corners) must be empty blocks.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5, b \u2265 4'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the dimensions of the portal must be at least 5 rows and 4 columns. In code, this can be implemented by iterating over sub-rectangles with these minimum dimensions.\n    '1 < x < a', '1 < x < b'\n    Explanation: These phrases define the range for checking the boundary conditions of the portal. In code, this can be implemented using loops that iterate over these ranges to verify the conditions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the minimum number of operations needed to convert a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves keeping track of the least number of operations required across all potential portal locations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Iterate over potential portal locations\" and \"Verify portal conditions\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating over each sub-rectangle and checking its conditions in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: The rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions, so no operations are needed.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Expected Output: 12\n    Explanation: All boundary blocks need to be converted to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A rectangle with dimensions exactly matching the minimum portal size.\n    Input: \n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: The rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions, so", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_create_portal(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, grid in test_cases:\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of the portal\n        for start_row in range(n -

A rectangle with the minimum size of 5x4 but all blocks are empty: The expected output is the number of boundary blocks that need to be changed to obsidian.\n       Explanation: All boundary blocks need to be changed to obsidian, so the output is the count of these blocks.\n    3. A rectangle with the minimum size of 5x4 but all blocks are obsidian: The expected output is the number of interior blocks that need to be changed to empty.\n       Explanation: All interior blocks need to be changed to empty, so the output is the count of these blocks.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to check if a sub-rectangle is already a portal and return 0 operations in that case. Additionally, we need to ensure that the logic correctly counts the number of changes needed for both boundary and interior blocks.\n    ```python\n    def calculate_operations(sub_rectangle):\n        # Check if already a portal", "Round_0": {"code": "def calculate_operations(n, m, grid):\n    min_operations = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n    for start_row in range(n):\n        for start_col in range(m):\n            # Iterate over all possible sizes of sub-rectangles\n            for a in range(5, n -
