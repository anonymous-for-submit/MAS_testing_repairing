{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

can either be impostors or crewmates. Comments from players indicate relationships between them, which can be used to deduce the maximum number of impostors or identify contradictions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of imposters': This means we need to find the highest count of impostors that can be deduced from the comments without contradictions.\n    'contradict each other': This indicates a situation where comments provide conflicting information about the same players, making it impossible to determine a consistent set of impostors and crewmates.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This refers to finding the largest possible number of impostors that can be deduced from the comments without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking for contradictions and calculating the maximum number of impostors should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while updating relationships based on comments, we should simultaneously check for contradictions and calculate the potential number of impostors.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no contradictions, and all players can be considered impostors.\n    2. Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, making it impossible to determine a consistent set of impostors and crewmates.\n    3. Test case with all comments indicating the same relationship (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 imposter\", \"2 3 imposter\", \"1 3 imposter\") = 3\n       Explanation: All players can be impostors as there are no contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    - Implement a union-find or graph-based approach to manage relationships and detect contradictions.\n    - Use a data structure to track the state of each player (impostor or crewmate) and ensure consistency across comments.\n    -

An impostor is a player who is not truthful, while a crewmate is truthful. Contradict refers to conflicting comments that make it impossible to determine the roles without inconsistency.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This means we need to find the highest count of impostors that can be deduced from the comments without contradiction.\n    Implementation: This can be implemented by counting the nodes marked as impostors in a graph traversal, ensuring no contradictions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This refers to the largest possible number of impostors that can be identified without contradictions.\n    Implementation: Use a graph traversal to color nodes and count the maximum number of nodes that can be colored as impostors.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to color the graph with two colors representing 'imposter' and 'crewmate'.\"\n    - \"If a contradiction is

The task is to determine the maximum number of impostors based on comments, or identify contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the highest count of impostors that can be deduced from the comments without contradictions. In code, this can be implemented by traversing the graph and counting impostors while ensuring no contradictions arise.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the largest possible number of impostors. This can be implemented by using graph traversal techniques to explore all possible configurations and select the one with the highest impostor count.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while traversing the graph to count impostors, we should also check for contradictions in the comments.
