{"name": "1606_A. AB Balance", "description": "You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b.\n\nLet \\operatorname{AB}(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in s as a substring. Analogically, \\operatorname{BA}(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in s as a substring.\n\nIn one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s)?\n\nReminder:\n\nThe number of occurrences of string d in s as substring is the number of indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s| - |d| + 1) such that substring s_i s_{i + 1} ... s_{i + |d| - 1} is equal to d. For example, \\operatorname{AB}(aabbbabaa) = 2 since there are two indices i: i = 2 where aabbbabaa and i = 6 where aabbbabaa.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the resulting string s with \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nb\naabbbabaa\nbbbb\nabbaaa\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.\n\nIn the second test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. \n\nIn the third test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.\n\nIn the fourth test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.", "tags": ["strings"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1606, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n", "output":

The task is to make these counts equal with the minimum number of character replacements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrases showing quantity relationships are present in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the goal is to achieve the balance between 'AB(s)' and 'BA(s)' with the least number of character changes possible. In code, this means finding the smallest number of replacements needed to equalize the counts.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps to calculate occurrences and determine if modifications are needed should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, after counting 'ab' and 'ba', the decision to modify the string should be made immediately based on the counts. This can be implemented using an if-else statement to check if the counts are equal and decide on modifications.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: s = \"aaaa\" -> Output: \"aaaa\"\n    Explanation: Both 'AB(s)' and 'BA(s)' are 0, so no changes are needed.\n\n    Case 2: s = \"abab\" -> Output: \"abab\"\n    Explanation: 'AB(s)' = 2 and 'BA(s)' = 1, one change is needed to balance, e.g., change the last 'b' to 'a' to make 'AB(s)' = 1 and 'BA(s)' = 1.\n\n    Case 3: s = \"baba\" -> Output: \"baba\"\n    Explanation: 'AB(s)' = 1 and 'BA(s)' = 2, one change is needed to balance, e.g., change the first 'b' to 'a' to make 'AB(s)' = 1 and 'BA(s)' = 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
