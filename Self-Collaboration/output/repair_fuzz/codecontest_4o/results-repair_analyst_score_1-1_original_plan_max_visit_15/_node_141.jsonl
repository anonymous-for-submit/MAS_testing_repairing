Instead, it permits you to extract any segment of the provided array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset, and reintegrate it back into the identical position.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions:\n\n  1. You have the option to choose any indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the segment's limits.\n  2. The segment a[l \u2026 r] is then replaced with a cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. Cyclic shift is also illustrated by these relations: the series [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 1, and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 2.\n\nFor instance, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then selecting l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 results in a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is subsequently shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you obtain a segment [8, 3, 2] that then replaces the original elements of the segment. Finally, you have a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nArrange the given array a utilizing no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. It's important to mention that you don't need to reduce the number of cyclic shifts. Any approach using n or fewer cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2.

Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j), where the upper left cell is (1, 1) and the lower right cell is (n, m). Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted; in particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \u00d7 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n \u00d7 m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \u2265 k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \u2265 k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 19) \u2014 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2.

requirement, a \"portal\" is a specific sub-rectangle configuration within a larger rectangle. It has specific conditions regarding the arrangement of obsidian and empty blocks, with obsidian blocks forming a border and empty blocks filling the interior, except for the corners which can be any type.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5, b \u2265 4': This means that the dimensions of the sub-rectangle (portal) must be at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    Implementation: Ensure that when iterating over possible sub-rectangles, only consider those with dimensions meeting these minimum requirements.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This refers to finding the smallest number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal.\n    Implementation: Track the number of operations for each sub-rectangle and update the minimum value found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking sub-rectangle conditions and calculating operations should be implemented simultaneously.

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    'sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400': This indicates a constraint on the total number of rows across all test cases, which can be used to optimize the code by limiting unnecessary computations.\n    'sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400': Similar to the constraint on n, this limits the total number of columns across all test cases.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': The goal is to find the least number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves comparing operation counts and selecting the smallest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Evaluate each sub-rectangle for portal conditions\" and \"Calculate operations needed for each sub-rectangle\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating over each sub-rectangle, checking its conditions, and calculating the required operations in a single loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Example: \n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions.\n\n    Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Case 3: A rectangle with alternating obsidian and empty blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    Output: 8\n    Explanation: Only the necessary border blocks"], "task_id": "codecontest/20"}

Grandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome, so she wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s. She also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose. A string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "completions": ["def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_erase_to_palindrome(n, s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_letters = set(s)\n    min_erases = float('inf')\n    \n    for letter in unique_letters:\n        left, right = 0, n -

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other, and it is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay, so for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4.

Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4.

There are exactly M pairs of people that are friends with each other. The inhabitants of Baltia are eager to throw a thriving party, but they adhere to very strict definitions of what constitutes a party and when it is deemed successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i. Two friends can not be in the list of friends twice (no pairs are repeated) and a person can be friends with themselves (U_i \u2260 V_i).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to organize a successful party, print 5 numbers indicating which 5 people should be invited to the party. If it's not possible to organize a successful party, print -1 instead.

Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] = YES\n       Explanation: Each element can be its own subarray with an LIS of 1, resulting in an XOR of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to ensure that the XOR operation is correctly applied to the LIS lengths of the subarrays.

The result in each position is 1 if only one of the bits is 1, and 0 if both are 0 or both are 1.\n\n    'longest increasing subsequence (LIS)'\n    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence of a sequence is the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one. It is a classic problem in computer science and dynamic programming.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'longest': refers to the maximum length of an increasing subsequence within a subarray.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they build upon each other. However, generating all possible subarrays and calculating their LIS lengths can be computationally expensive. Instead, consider optimizing the approach by focusing on strategic splits that might lead to an XOR of zero.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with a sequence of strictly decreasing numbers:\n    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: Any split will result in LIS lengths that do not XOR to zero.\n\n    Test case with a sequence of identical numbers:\n    Input: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The entire sequence can be one subarray with LIS length 1, resulting in XOR of 0.\n\n    Test case with a sequence of alternating increase and decrease:\n    Input: [1, 3, 2, 4, 3]\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: Possible split: [1, 3], [2, 4], [3] with LIS lengths [2, 2, 1], XOR is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases efficiently.\n    Consider using dynamic programming or greedy strategies to find valid splits without generating all subarrays.\n    Example code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_split_to_zero_xor(sequence):\n        # Implement logic to find strategic splits\n        # Use dynamic programming or greedy approach to find LIS lengths\n        # Check XOR condition\n        pass\n    ```\n\nYES"], "task_id": "codecontest/88"}

For example, if the whole array is colored blue or red, one of the operations becomes unavailable.\n\nDetermine whether it is possible to make 0 or more steps such that the resulting array is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n?\n\nIn other words, check whether there exists a sequence of steps (possibly empty) such that after applying it, the array a contains in some order all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), each exactly once.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of input data sets in the test.\n\nThe description of each set of input data consists of three lines.

If the dragon is already poisoned, the effect is reset with the new attack.\n\n    'minimum possible value of k'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the smallest duration of the poison effect that is sufficient to deal at least h damage to the dragon.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least h damage'\n    Explanation: The total damage dealt to the dragon must be greater than or equal to h.

He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it.\n\nFor example, word \"abbaaba\" contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. Then, he writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. After that, he wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. Remember that each bigram is formed by two consecutive letters of the original word.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'.

The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right, with the cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, so after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc); initially, dr = 1 and dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position, and there is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print an integer \u2014 the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell.

The initial position of the robot is (6, 1) and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 8). See the illustration of this example in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example, the floor is the same, but the initial position of the robot is now (9, 9), and the position of the dirty cell is (1, 1). In this example, the robot went straight to the dirty cell and clean it. \n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, the floor has the size 9 \u00d7 8.

The initial position of the robot is (2, 2) and the position of the dirty cell is (5, 8). \n\n<image>\n\nIn the last example, the robot was already standing in the same column as the dirty cell, so it can clean the cell right away. \n", "completions": ["def robot_cleaner():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        r_b = int(data[index + 2])\n        c_b = int(data[index + 3])\n        r_d = int(data[index + 4])\n        c_d = int(data[index + 5])\n        index += 6\n        \n        #

This can be done by updating the robot's position and checking if it can clean the dirty cell in the same loop iteration.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. n = 1, m = 1, r_b = 1, c_b = 1, r_d = 1, c_d = 1 = 0\n       Explanation: The robot starts on the dirty cell, so it cleans it immediately.\n    2. n = 100, m = 100, r_b = 1, c_b = 1, r_d = 100, c_d = 100 = 198\n       Explanation: The robot will move diagonally across the entire grid, reflecting off the walls, and will take 198 seconds to clean the cell at (100, 100).\n    3. n = 10, m = 10, r_b = 5, c_b = 5, r_d = 5, c_d = 10 = 0\n       Explanation: The robot is already in the same row as the dirty cell, so it cleans it immediately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of simulating the robot's movement and checking the cleaning condition will naturally handle these cases. \n\nNO"], "task_id": "codecontest/160"}

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other, and it is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e, and each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay, so for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below.

Your program should efficiently calculate the number of segments [l;r] whose path of calculations only results in integers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe third line contains n symbols without spaces between them \u2014 the array b_1, b_2 \u2026 b_n (b_i= '/' or b_i= '*' for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of simple segments [l;r].\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n1 2 3\n*/*\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n6 4 10 1 2 15 1\n*/*/*//\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n8", "completions": ["def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    simple_segments_count = 0\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        x = 1\n        is_simple = True\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if b[r] == '*':\n                x *= a[r]\n            elif b[r] == '/':\n                if x % a[r] != 0:\n                    is_simple = False\n                    break\n                x //= a[r]\n            \n            if is_simple:\n                simple_segments_count += 1\n\n    return simple_segments_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    b = data[n+1]\n    \n    result = count_simple_segments(n, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    simple_segments = 0\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        x = 1\n        is_simple = True\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if b[r] == '*':\n                x *= a[r]\n            elif b[r] == '/':\n                if x % a[r] != 0:\n                    is_simple = False\n                    break\n                x //= a[r]\n            if is_simple:\n                simple_segments += 1\n\n    return simple_segments\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    b = data[n+1]\n    \n    result = count_simple_segments(n, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    simple_segments_count = 0\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        x = 1\n        is_simple = True\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if b[r] == '*':\n                x *= a[r]\n            elif b[r] == '/':\n                if x % a[r] != 0:\n                    is_simple = False\n                    break\n                x //= a[r]\n            \n            if is_simple:\n                simple_segments_count += 1\n\n    return simple_segments_count\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    b = data[n+1]\n    \n    result = count_simple_segments(n, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nmain()", "def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    def is_integer(x):\n        return x == int(x)\n\n    simple_segments_count = 0\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        x = 1\n        is_simple = True\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if b[r] == '*':\n                x *= a[r]\n            elif b[r] == '/':\n                if x % a[r] != 0:\n                    is_simple = False\n                    break\n                x //= a[r]\n            \n            if not is_integer(x):\n                is_simple = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_simple:\n            simple_segments_count += (n - l)\n\n    return simple_segments_count\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    b = data[n+1]\n    \n    result = count_simple_segments(n, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    simple_segments_count = 0\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        x = 1\n        is_simple = True\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if b[r] == '*':\n                x *= a[r]\n            elif b[r] == '/':\n                if x % a[r] != 0:\n                    is_simple = False\n                    break\n                x //= a[r]\n            if is_simple:\n                simple_segments_count += 1\n\n    return simple_segments_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    b = data[n+1]\n    \n    result = count_simple_segments(n, a, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def count_simple_segments(n, a, b):\n    simple_segments_count = 0\n\n    #

The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.", "completions": ["def can_form_ticks(n, m, k, field):\n    # Create a copy of the field to mark the cells that are part of valid ticks\n    marked = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Iterate over each cell to find potential tick centers\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if field[i][j] == '*':\n                # Check if a tick of size at least k can be drawn with center at (i, j)\n                d = 0\n                while True:\n                    if i -

Two colorings are considered different if at least one node is colored with a different color.\n\nThe answer may be too large, so output the answer modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains the integers k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 60) \u2014 the number of levels in the perfect binary tree you need to color.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of the different colorings modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n24576\n\n\nInput\n\n\n14\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n934234\n\nNote\n\nIn the picture below, you can see one of the correct colorings of the first example.\n", "completions": ["def count_good_colorings(k):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Adjacency rules based on Rubik's cube\n    adjacency_rules = {\n        'White': ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Orange'],\n        'Yellow': ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Orange'],\n        'Green': ['White', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Orange'],\n        'Blue': ['White', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Orange'],\n        'Red': ['White', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue'],\n        'Orange': ['White', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']\n    }\n    \n    # Number of colors\n    num_colors = len(adjacency_rules)\n    \n    # Base case for k = 1\n    if k == 1:\n        return num_colors\n    \n    # Calculate number of nodes\n    num_nodes = 2**k -

This can be done by calculating the mean and then using a hashmap to efficiently find pairs that satisfy the condition in one pass through the array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 3\n           3\n           1 1 1\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so any pair can be removed without changing the mean.\n    \n    Input: 3\n           4\n           1 2 3 4\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No pair of elements can be removed to keep the mean unchanged.\n    \n    Input: 3\n           5\n           5 5 5 5 5\n    Output: 10\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so any pair can be removed without changing the mean.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases efficiently.\n    The code should use a hashmap to store the frequency of each element and calculate the required value for each pair to maintain the mean. This will allow us to count valid pairs efficiently without explicitly checking each pair.\n\nYES"], "task_id": "codecontest/60"}

The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them, making it possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate, requiring max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy to travel. |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n).

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string. These letters don't have to be adjacent;\n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2.

So for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string.

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "completions": ["def flower_growth(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, days in test_cases:\n        height = 1\n        consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if days[i] == 1:\n                if i > 0 and days[i-1] == 1:\n                    height += 5\n                else:\n                    height += 1\n                consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n            else:\n                consecutive_unwatered_days += 1\n                if consecutive_unwatered_days == 2:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n        \n        results.append(height)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        days = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, days))\n    \n    results = flower_growth(test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def flower_growth(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, days in test_cases:\n        height = 1\n        consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if days[i] == 0:\n                consecutive_unwatered_days += 1\n                if consecutive_unwatered_days == 2:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n            else:\n                consecutive_unwatered_days = 0\n                if i > 0 and days[i -

Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n.

This can be done by iterating over each unique letter and performing the removal and palindrome check in one loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: n = 1, s = \"a\"\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: A single character is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.\n\n    Test case: n = 2, s = \"ab\"\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: It's impossible to make \"ab\" a palindrome by removing occurrences of a single letter.\n\n    Test case: n = 3, s = \"aaa\"\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The string is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of iterating over each unique letter and checking for palindrome formation will naturally handle these cases.\n\nYES"], "task_id": "codecontest/30"}

There are n cities in Omkarland, and unusually, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other, ensuring that any city is accessible from any other city via the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e, and each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay, so for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below.

For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays. For example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].

The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}.

This means that during the calculations, every division operation must result in an integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'r - l + 1'\n    Explanation: This phrase describes the number of operations or steps in the path of calculations for a segment [l; r]. It is implemented in code by iterating from l to r and counting the steps.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for calculating the path of calculations and checking if all results are integers should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the logic for iterating over the segment and updating x should be combined with the check for integer results in one loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Input: 2\n       a = [1, 1]\n       b = [/, *]\n       Output: 3\n       Explanation: All segments [1,1], [2,2], and [1,2] are simple because all operations result in integers.\n       \n    2. Input: 3\n       a = [2, 3, 5]\n       b = [*, /, *]\n       Output: 3\n       Explanation: Segments [1,1], [2,2], and [3,3] are simple. Segment [1,2] is not simple because 2 * 3 / 3 = 2, which is an integer, but [1,3] is not simple because 2 * 3 / 5 is not an integer.\n       \n    3. Input: 4\n       a = [10, 5, 2, 1]\n       b = [/, *, /, *]\n       Output: 4\n       Explanation: Segments [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], and [4,4] are simple. Segment [1,2] is not simple because 10 / 5 * 5 is not an integer.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where division results in non-integers.\n    ```python\n    def is_integer(x):\n        return x == int(x)\n\n    # In the loop where we calculate the path of calculations:\n    if b[i] == '/':\n        x"], "task_id": "codecontest/35"}

There are precisely M pairs of individuals who are friends with each other. The inhabitants of Baltia are eager to throw a thriving party, but they adhere to very strict definitions of what constitutes a party and when it is deemed successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a congregation of exactly 5 individuals. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i. Two friends can not be in the list of friends twice (no pairs are repeated) and a person can be friends with themselves (U_i \u2260 V_i).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to organize a successful party, print 5 numbers indicating which 5 people should be invited to the party. If it's not possible to organize a successful party, print -1 instead.

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. The process of painting these cells follows a symmetrical pattern. There is some symmetry in the way the cells are painted. \n3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j \u00b1 h) for all h between 0 and d are painted; in particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again.

{"index": 128, "parent": 110, "child": [], "score": true, "passes": 4, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "prompt": "n students were present at the inaugural meeting of the Berland SU programming course (n being an even number). All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday). The days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.\n\nEach student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson. They also specified which are not. \n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to select two separate weekdays to arrange the lessons for the groups (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of t testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains 5 integers, each of them is 0 or 1. If the j-th integer is 1, then the i-th student can attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. If the j-th integer is 0, then the i-th student cannot attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. \n\nAdditional constraints on the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is convenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to divide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days for the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of their group, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n4\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n2\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there is a way to meet all the constraints. For example, the first group can consist of the first and the third students, they will attend the lessons on Thursday (the fourth day); the second group can consist of the second and the fourth students, and they will attend the lessons on Tuesday (the second day).\n\nIn the second testcase, it is impossible to divide the students into groups so they attend the lessons on different days.", "completions": ["def can_divide_students(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, availability in test_cases:\n        possible = False\n        #
