{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    'sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400': This indicates a constraint on the total number of rows across all test cases, which can be used to optimize the code by limiting unnecessary computations.\n    'sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400': Similar to the constraint on n, this limits the total number of columns across all test cases.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': The goal is to find the least number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves comparing operation counts and selecting the smallest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Evaluate each sub-rectangle for portal conditions\" and \"Calculate operations needed for each sub-rectangle\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating over each sub-rectangle, checking its conditions, and calculating the required operations in a single loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: A rectangle with all blocks already forming a portal.\n    Example: \n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1111\n    1001\n    1001\n    1001\n    1111\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions.\n\n    Case 2: A rectangle with no obsidian blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    0000\n    Output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n    Case 3: A rectangle with alternating obsidian and empty blocks.\n    Example:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5 4\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    0101\n    1010\n    Output: 8\n    Explanation: Only the necessary border blocks", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_portal(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, grid in test_cases:\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n        for start_row in range(n):\n            for start_col in range(m):\n                # Iterate over all possible sizes of sub-rectangles\n                for a in range(5, n -

Explanation: In the context of the requirement, a \"portal\" is a specific sub-rectangle configuration within a larger rectangle. It has specific conditions regarding the arrangement of obsidian and empty blocks, with obsidian blocks forming a border and empty blocks filling the interior, except for the corners which can be any type.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'a \u2265 5, b \u2265 4': This means that the dimensions of the sub-rectangle (portal) must be at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    Implementation: Ensure that when iterating over possible sub-rectangles, only consider those with dimensions meeting these minimum requirements.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This refers to finding the smallest number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal.\n    Implementation: Track the number of operations for each sub-rectangle and update the minimum value found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to checking sub-rectangle conditions and calculating operations should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"For each sub-rectangle, check the conditions for being a portal.\"\n    - \"Calculate the number of changes needed to satisfy the portal conditions.\"\n    These can be combined into a single loop that iterates over each sub-rectangle, checks its current state, and calculates the required changes in one pass.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. A rectangle that is already a portal: If the input rectangle already satisfies the portal conditions, the expected output is 0 operations.\n       Explanation: No changes are needed if the rectangle is already a portal.\n    2. A rectangle with minimum dimensions (5x4) but all blocks are the opposite of what is needed: The expected output is the maximum number of changes needed to convert it into a portal.\n       Explanation: This tests the algorithm's ability to handle the worst-case scenario for a minimum-sized rectangle.\n    3. A rectangle with dimensions larger than the minimum but with no possible portal configuration: The expected output is the minimum number of operations needed for any possible sub-rectangle.\n       Explanation: This ensures the algorithm correctly identifies the best possible sub-rectangle to transform.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to ensure that:\n    -
