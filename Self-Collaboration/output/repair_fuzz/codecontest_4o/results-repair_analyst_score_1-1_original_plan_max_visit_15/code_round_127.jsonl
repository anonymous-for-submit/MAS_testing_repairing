{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2
