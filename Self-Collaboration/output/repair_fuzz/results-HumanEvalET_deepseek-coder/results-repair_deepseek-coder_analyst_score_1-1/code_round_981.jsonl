Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is a concatenation of all the elements in the list. The order of the strings in the resulting single string should match the order they appear in the list. A delimiter such as space or comma should not be added between the strings unless it is part of the strings themselves. Consider edge cases such as an empty list, where the result should be an empty string. Ensure that the function handles strings of varying lengths efficiently. Be sure to test your solution with different cases to ensure robustness of the implemented solution.\n>>> concatenate([])\n    ''\n    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])\n    'abc'\n    '''",
