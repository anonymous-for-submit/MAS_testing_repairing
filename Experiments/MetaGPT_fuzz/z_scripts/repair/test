You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b, and in one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b. What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve \operatorname{AB}(s) = \operatorname{BA}(s)?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.

Output

For each test case, print the resulting string s with \operatorname{AB}(s) = \operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


4
b
aabbbabaa
abbb
abbaab


Output


b
aabbbabaa
bbbb
abbaaa

Note

In the first test case, both \operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.

In the second test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. 

In the third test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.

In the fourth test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.
