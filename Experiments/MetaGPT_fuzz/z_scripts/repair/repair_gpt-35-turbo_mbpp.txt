multi-gen-prompt:
## Coding Question

### Description
Construct a Python function to determine the least number of rotations needed to obtain an identical string by considering all cyclic permutations. 

### Input
- A non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.

### Output
- An integer representing the minimum number of rotations needed such that the string becomes identical to the original configuration.

### Example
```python
# Example 1
input_string = "abcde"
output = 5 # Explanation: rotating each character results in original configuration after 5 rotations.

# Example 2
input_string = "aaaa"
output = 1 # Explanation: any rotation results in the identical string.

# Example 3
input_string = "abab"
output = 2 # Explanation: rotating by 2 positions gives the identical string.

# Example 4
input_string = "abcabc"
output = 3 # Explanation: rotating by 3 positions gives the identical string.
```

### Constraints
- The length of the input string will be between 1 and 1000.

multi-gen-prompt:
Write a function that handles edge cases effectively, especially when n is less than or equal to 1, to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1 efficiently and prevent excessive computation time for large n values.
multi-gen-prompt:
Write a function that takes in an integer n and calculates the harmonic sum of n-1, ensuring efficient handling for large values of n to prevent excessive computation time. Additionally, handle cases where n is less than or equal to 1 appropriately to address edge cases.
