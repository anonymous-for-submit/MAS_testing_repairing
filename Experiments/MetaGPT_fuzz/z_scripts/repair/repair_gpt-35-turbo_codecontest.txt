multi-gen-prompt:
Casimir can erase exactly one letter 'B' and one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string. This action reduces the length of the string by 2 each time and can be chosen independently on each turn. 

Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.

For example, with s = "ABCABC" he can obtain a string s = "ACBC" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.

For a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this? Provide an efficient solution that clearly explains the logic used to determine the sequence of actions.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

In Berland, n different types of banknotes are used, and banknotes of the i-th type have denomination 10^{a_i} burles (burles are the currency used in Berland); the denomination of banknotes of the first type is exactly 1. Let's denote f(s) as the minimum number of banknotes required to represent exactly s burles, with no way to do it with fewer banknotes. For example, if the denominations of banknotes used in Berland are 1, 10 and 100, then f(59) = 14: 9 banknotes with denomination of 1 burle and 5 banknotes with denomination of 10 burles can be used to represent exactly 9 ⋅ 1 + 5 ⋅ 10 = 59 burles. For a given integer k, find the minimum positive number of burles s that cannot be represented with k or fewer banknotes (that is, f(s) > k).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 9).

Find the string S', which is the lexicographically smallest permutation of S, that does not contain T as a subsequence.

You are given strings S and T, which are made up of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that T is a rearrangement of the string abc. Find the string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'. A string a is a permutation of string b if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings. A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:

a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100), consisting of lowercase English letters.

The second line of each test case contains a string T that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence, |T| = 3).

Note that there is no limit on the sum of |S| across all test cases.

The robot's starting position plays a crucial role in ensuring the successful execution of the command sequence without any interruption caused by falling off the board. This strategic decision-making is essential for maximizing the robot's performance.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.

In the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' — the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.

It is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

Print t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 ≤ r ≤ n) and c (1 ≤ c ≤ m), separated by a space — the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.

What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve AB(s) = BA(s)? It is required to consider a balanced approach where transforms are made symmetrically to minimize the total number of changes required. 

You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b. Let AB(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in s as a substring, and analogically, BA(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in s as a substring. In one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.

Output

For each test case, print the resulting string s with \operatorname{AB}(s) = \operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


4
b
aabbbabaa
abbb
abbaab


Output


b
aabbbabaa
bbbb
abbaaa

Note

In the first test case, both \operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.

In the second test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. 

In the third test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.

In the fourth test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.

Output

For each test case, print the resulting string s with \operatorname{AB}(s) = \operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


4
b
aabbbabaa
abbb
abbaab


Output


b
aabbbabaa
bbbb
abbaaa

Note

In the first test case, both \operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.

In the second test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. 

In the third test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.

In the fourth test case, \operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.
