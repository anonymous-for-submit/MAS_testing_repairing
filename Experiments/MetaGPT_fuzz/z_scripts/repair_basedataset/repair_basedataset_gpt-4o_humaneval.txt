        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one

    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True

    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
