    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:

    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]

You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
and now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals, which means you need to eat them until you reach the required amount.
you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals, the number of carrots left after your meals ] if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry. 
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]

    @need : integer
