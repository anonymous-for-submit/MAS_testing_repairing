An Armstrong number, also known as a narcissistic number, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because it has three digits. Each of the digits is raised to the power of three and then summed: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153. If the number is not an Armstrong number, the function should return false. If it is an Armstrong number, the function should return true.
