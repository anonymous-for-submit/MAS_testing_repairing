The function should efficiently return the maximum element from a list. It should handle edge cases such as empty lists and be compatible with various Python versions. Documentation should be clear to facilitate easy integration.
requirement pool:
- Implement the function to find the maximum element in a list

- Provide detailed error messages for invalid inputs
We will implement a function that validates the input planet names against a predefined list of planets in the solar system. The function will determine the indices of the given planets and return the planets that lie between them, sorted by their proximity to the sun. We will use a simple list to store the planet names and handle invalid inputs by returning an empty tuple.

- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions.
- Add error handling for non-string inputs.
- Include comprehensive unit tests for various scenarios.
We will implement a simple and efficient function using Python's list comprehension to filter strings containing a specified substring. This approach is both high-performance and easy to understand, making it suitable for handling large lists. We will ensure compatibility with different Python versions by using standard library features.


requirement analysis:
The function should efficiently filter a list of strings based on the presence of a specified substring. It should handle edge cases such as empty lists and substrings gracefully, ensuring performance is maintained even with large datasets.
requirement pool:
- Implement the main filtering function.
- Optimize for performance with large datasets.
- Ensure compatibility with various input formats.
- Provide detailed documentation and examples.
- Include error handling for invalid inputs.
We will implement a simple function using Python's built-in capabilities to filter a list of strings based on the presence of a specified substring. The function will be optimized for performance by using list comprehensions, which are efficient for iterating over lists. We will ensure compatibility with various input formats by handling edge cases such as empty lists and substrings. The function will be case-sensitive by default, but this can be adjusted based on user feedback.


requirement analysis:
The requirement is to create a function that filters a list of strings based on the presence of a given substring. The function should be efficient, handle edge cases, and be easy to use and integrate.
