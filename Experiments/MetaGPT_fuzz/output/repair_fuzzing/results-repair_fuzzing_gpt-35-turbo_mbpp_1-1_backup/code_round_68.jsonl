We will leverage the collections library to efficiently count occurrences of numbers in a list.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'count occurrences': Refers to the number of times a specific number appears in the given list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the frequency function:\n    - Import the Counter class from the collections module.\n    - Define the function frequency(lst, num) that takes a list and a number as input.\n    - Use Counter(lst) to create a dictionary with the count of each element in the list.\n    - Return the count of the given number from the Counter dictionary.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    counts = Counter(lst)\n    return counts[num]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(frequency([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n# [edge case] \n    frequency([1, 2, 3], 4) = 0\n    Explanation: The number 4 does not appear in the list [1, 2, 3], so the expected output is 0.\n\n    frequency([1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 2) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears 3 times in the list [1, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\n    frequency([], 5) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so any number will have a count of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The Counter class efficiently handles counting occurrences in lists.\n", "requirement pool:\n- Implement a function that iterates through the list and counts occurrences of a given number\n- Handle
