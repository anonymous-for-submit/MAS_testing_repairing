Initialize a variable sum_series to 0.\n    2. Iterate from i=0 to n // 2.\n    3. Calculate the value using the formula (n - 2*i) and add it to sum_series.\n    4. Return the final sum_series value.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_series(6) = 12\n    Explanation: For n=6, the series would be 6 + (6-2) + (6-4) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers both even and odd values of n correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to iterate through the series (n - 2*i) for i=0 to n // 2 and sum the values. It should handle both even and odd values of n by adjusting the stopping condition appropriately.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core logic to iterate through the series and calculate the sum\n- Add input validation to ensure n is a positive integer\n- Include unit tests to verify the function's correctness\nWe will use Python and the built-in functions to implement the sum_series function as
