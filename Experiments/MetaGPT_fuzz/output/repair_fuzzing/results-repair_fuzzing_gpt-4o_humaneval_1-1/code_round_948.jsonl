Return a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The digit '0' is even, so the expected output is (1, 0).\n    \n    even_odd_count(-101) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The digits '1' and '1' are odd, and '0' is even, so the expected output is (1, 2).\n    \n    even_odd_count(111) = (0, 3)\n    Explanation: All digits are '1', which are odd, so the expected output is (0, 3).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of iterating over each character and checking if it is a digit will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count even and odd digits in an integer input, ignoring any non-numeric characters.

The function will convert the input to a string, filter out non-numeric characters, and count even and odd digits. We will ensure the function handles negative numbers by considering the absolute value of the input. The function will be optimized for performance by using efficient list comprehensions and built-in functions.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'integer'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves processing an integer input, which may include negative values. The core concept is to handle the integer as a string to count even and odd digits.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the input integer to a string to handle each digit separately.\n    2. Use the absolute value of the integer to ignore the negative sign.\n    3. Filter out non-numeric characters, though in this case, the input is an integer, so this step is more about ensuring robustness.\n    4. Count even digits by checking if each digit modulo 2 equals zero.\n    5. Count odd digits by checking if each digit modulo 2 equals one.\n    6. Return a tuple with counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 is considered an even digit, so the count of even digits is 1 and odd digits is 0.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-101) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The digits are 1, 0, and 1. The digit 0 is even, and the digits 1 are odd, resulting in a count of (1, 2).\n    \n    even_odd_count(222) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: All digits are even (2), so the count of even digits is 3 and odd digits is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of converting the number to a string and using absolute value handles these cases naturally.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count even and odd digits in an integer input, ignoring any non-numeric characters.

If it is a digit, we will determine if it is even or odd and update the respective count. This approach ensures that non-numeric characters are ignored and both positive and negative integers are handled efficiently. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to achieve this without any additional libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even and odd digits'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count the number of even and odd digits in the integer, ignoring any non-numeric characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
