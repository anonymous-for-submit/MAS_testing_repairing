Edge cases such as empty lists should be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to calculate the sum of odd numbers at even indices\n- Optimize the function for performance with large lists\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty lists\n- Provide comprehensive documentation for the function\n- Test the function with various list inputs to ensure accuracy\nWe will implement a function that iterates over the list, checking each element at even indices to determine if it is odd. If it is, we will add it to a running total. This approach ensures that we only traverse the list once, optimizing performance for large lists. We will handle edge cases such as empty lists by returning 0, as there are no elements to sum.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd numbers': Refers to integers that are not divisible by 2.\n    'even indices': Refers to positions in the list that are divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of odd numbers at even indices.\n    2. Iterate over the list using an index `i` and check if the index is even.\n    3. If the index is even, check if the element at that index is odd.\n    4. If the element is odd, add it to `total_sum`.\n    5. After iterating through the list, return `total_sum`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The only element is at index 0 (even) and is odd, so the sum is 1.\n    \n    solution([2]) = 0\n    Explanation: The only element is at index 0 (even) but is not odd, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    solution([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no elements to sum, resulting in a sum of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic naturally handles these cases by iterating over the list and checking conditions.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should iterate over the list, checking each even index for an odd number, and summing these numbers. It should be efficient and handle edge cases like very large lists or lists with no odd numbers at even indices.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sum odd numbers at even indices.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large lists.\n- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.\n- Include unit tests to verify functionality.\nWe will use a simple list comprehension to iterate over the list and sum the odd numbers located at even indices. This approach is efficient for small to medium-sized lists and maintains compatibility with Python 3.x. For large lists, Python's built-in functions are sufficient to handle the performance requirements without needing external libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd numbers'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to numbers that are not divisible by 2.\n\n    'even indices'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to positions in the list that are divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
