After iterating through all numbers, return the counter value.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fizz_buzz(0) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no numbers below 0, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    fizz_buzz(11) = 0\n    Explanation: The only number below 11 is 0, which is not divisible by 11 or 13, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    fizz_buzz(14) = 1\n    Explanation: The numbers below 14 that are divisible by 11 or 13 are 11 and 13. The number 13 contains the digit '7' once, so the expected output is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
