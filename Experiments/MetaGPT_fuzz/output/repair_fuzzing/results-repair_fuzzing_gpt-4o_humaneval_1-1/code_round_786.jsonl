The function will be documented with clear examples and edge cases will be considered, such as empty arrays and arrays with all identical elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'palindromic'\n    Explanation: A palindromic array is one that reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for an array to be palindromic, the first element must be equal to the last element, the second element must be equal to the second-to-last element, and so on.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum number of elements'\n    Explanation: This refers to the smallest count of changes needed to make the array palindromic. In code, this can be implemented by counting mismatches between corresponding elements from the start and end of the array and summing them up.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to find the least number of changes required.
