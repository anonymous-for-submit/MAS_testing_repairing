Handle potential errors such as division by zero or invalid operators.\n\n# [edge case]\n    do_algebra(['+'], [5, 0]) = 5\n    Explanation: The expression is '5 + 0', which evaluates to 5.\n\n    do_algebra(['//'], [5, 0]) = Error\n    Explanation: The expression '5 // 0' results in a division by zero error.\n\n    do_algebra(['**', '+'], [2, 3, 0]) = 9\n    Explanation: The expression is '2 ** 3 + 0', which evaluates to 8 + 0 = 8.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: operator list length must be one less than operand list length.\")\n        \n        try:\n            expression = ''.join(f\"{operand[i]} {operator[i]} \" for i in range(len(operator))) + str(operand[-1])\n            return eval(expression)\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n        except Exception as e:\n            return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n"], "scores": [0.6124, 0.6124, 1.0, 1.0, 0.845, 1.0, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, false, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [79, 79, 129, 129, 109, 129, 79, 79, 79, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef do_algebra(operator: list[str], operand: list[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and evaluates an algebraic expression from the given operators and operands.\n\n    Parameters:\n    operator (list[str]): A list of algebraic operators ('+', '-', '*', '//', '**').\n    operand (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The result of the evaluated expression.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input lists are invalid or if division by zero occurs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input lists\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: operator list length must be one less than operand list length.\")\n\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression string\n        expression = ''.join(f\"{operand[i]} {operator[i]} \" for i in range(len(operator))) + str(operand[-1])\n        \n        # Evaluate the expression using eval()\n        result = eval(expression)\n        \n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# result = do_algebra(['**', '+'], [2, 3, 0])\n# print(result)  # Output: 9\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 131, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 131}
