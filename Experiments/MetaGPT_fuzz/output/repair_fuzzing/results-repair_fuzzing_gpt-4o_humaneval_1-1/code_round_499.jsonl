We will use Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently iterate over the string and check the conditions. The function will handle edge cases gracefully, such as strings shorter than 3 characters or strings with repeating characters. We will provide detailed error messages for non-happy strings and comprehensive documentation with examples.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'happy'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, a string is considered \"happy\" if it is at least 3 characters long and every 3 consecutive characters are distinct.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 3': The string must have a minimum length of 3 characters.\n    Implementation: Check if the length of the string is greater than or equal to 3 using `len(s) >= 3`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Check if the length of the string `s` is at least 3. If not, return `False`.\n2. Iterate through the string, checking every set of 3 consecutive characters.\n3. For each set of 3 characters, check if all characters are distinct.\n4. If any set of 3 consecutive characters is not distinct, return `False`.\n5. If all sets of 3 consecutive characters are distinct, return `True`.\n\n# [edge case]\n    is_happy('') = False\n    Explanation: The string is empty, so it does not meet the minimum length requirement of 3.\n    \n    is_happy('ab') = False\n    Explanation: The string has only 2 characters, which is less than the required minimum length of 3.\n    \n    is_happy('aaa') = False\n    Explanation: The string has 3 characters, but they are not distinct.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already checks for the minimum length and distinctness of every set of 3 consecutive characters.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_happy(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the string is happy.\n    A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be checked.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the string is happy, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the string length is less than 3\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate through the string, checking every set of 3 consecutive characters\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n        # Extract the current set of 3 consecutive characters\n        triplet = s[i:i+3]\n        \n        # Check if all characters in the triplet are distinct\n        if len(set(triplet)) != 3:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all sets of 3 consecutive characters are distinct, return True\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(is_happy(\"abc\"))  # Expected: True\n# print(is_happy(\"aab\"))  # Expected: False\n# print(is_happy(\"abca\")) # Expected: True\n# print(is_happy(\"aaa\"))  # Expected: False\n# print(is_happy(\"ab\"))   # Expected: False\n# print(is_happy(\"\"))     # Expected: False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 499, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 70}
