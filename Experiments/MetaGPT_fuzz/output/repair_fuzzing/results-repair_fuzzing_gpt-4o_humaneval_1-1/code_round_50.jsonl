Return the largest prime factor from the list of prime factors.\n\n# [edge case]\n    largest_prime_factor(2) = 2\n    Explanation: Although 2 is a prime number, it is also its own largest prime factor.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(4) = 2\n    Explanation: The prime factors of 4 are [2, 2], and the largest prime factor is 2.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(6) = 3\n    Explanation: The prime factors of 6 are [2, 3], and the largest prime factor is 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic using sympy's prime factorization will naturally handle these cases correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently compute the largest prime factor of a given integer greater than 1. It should handle both small and large numbers, ensuring performance optimization. The output should be straightforward, providing only the largest prime factor.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to find the largest prime factor.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance with large numbers.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases gracefully.\n- Provide documentation and examples for user understanding.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\nWe will implement a function to find the largest prime factor using a combination of trial division and optimizations for performance. The function will utilize the sympy library to efficiently check for prime numbers and factorize large numbers. This approach ensures accuracy and performance, especially for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'prime factor'\n    Explanation: A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number itself. The task is to find the largest such factor for a given number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than 1': This indicates that the input number n is always greater than 1, which simplifies the problem as we don't need to handle cases where n is 1 or less.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This means we need to find the biggest prime factor of the given number n.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    2. Divide n by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2, keeping track of the largest factor.\n    3. Move to the next odd numbers and repeat the division process.\n    4. If n becomes a prime number greater than 2, it is the largest prime factor.\n    5. Return the largest prime factor found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(2) = 2\n    Explanation: The smallest prime number is 2, and if n is 2, then 2 is its largest prime factor.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(9) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 9 has prime factors 3 and 3, and the largest is 3.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(15) = 5\n    Explanation: The number 15 has prime factors 3 and 5, and the largest is 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
