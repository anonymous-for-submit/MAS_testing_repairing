It should handle large strings without performance degradation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Optimize for time complexity\n- Optimize for space complexity\n- Ensure case insensitivity\n- Handle large input strings efficiently\n- Provide clear documentation\nWe will implement a function that uses a set to store characters, which inherently ensures uniqueness and provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions. This approach is both time and space efficient. We will convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity before processing.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: This refers to the unique characters in the string, ignoring case differences. For example, 'a' and 'A' are considered the same character.\n\n    'case insensitivity'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
