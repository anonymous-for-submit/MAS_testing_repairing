Handle edge cases for numbers 0 and 1 by returning an empty list.\n3. Start with the smallest prime number, 2, and divide the input number by it as long as it is divisible.\n4. For each division, append the prime number to the list of factors.\n5. Increment the divisor and repeat the process until the input number is reduced to 1.\n6. Return the list of prime factors.\n\n# [edge case]\n    factorize(0) = []\n    Explanation: The number 0 has no prime factors, so the function should return an empty list.\n    \n    factorize(1) = []\n    Explanation: The number 1 has no prime factors, so the function should return an empty list.\n    \n    factorize(2) = [2]\n    Explanation: The number 2 is a prime number itself, so its only prime factor is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases for numbers like 0 and 1.\n    ```python\n    if n <= 1:\n        return []\n    ```\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sympy import primerange\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Factorizes the given integer into its prime factors.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer to be factorized.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: A list of prime factors of n in ascending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases for 0 and 1\n    if n <= 1:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize the list to store prime factors\n    prime_factors = []\n\n    # Start with the smallest prime number, 2\n    for prime in primerange(2, n + 1):\n        # Divide n by the prime number as long as it is divisible\n        while n % prime == 0:\n            prime_factors.append(prime)\n            n //= prime\n\n        # If n is reduced to 1, break out of the loop\n        if n == 1:\n            break\n\n    return prime_factors\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(factorize(8))  # Output: [2, 2, 2]\n# print(factorize(18)) # Output: [2, 3, 3]\n# print(factorize(0))  # Output: []\n# print(factorize(1))  # Output: []\n# print(factorize(2))  # Output: [2]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 139, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 140}
