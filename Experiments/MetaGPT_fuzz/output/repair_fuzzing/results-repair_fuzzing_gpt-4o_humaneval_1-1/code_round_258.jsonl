Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The digit '0' is considered even, so the count of even digits is 1 and odd digits is 0.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-101) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The digits are '1', '0', and '1'. '0' is even, and both '1's are odd, resulting in (1, 2).\n    \n    even_odd_count(222) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: All digits are '2', which are even, resulting in (3, 0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
