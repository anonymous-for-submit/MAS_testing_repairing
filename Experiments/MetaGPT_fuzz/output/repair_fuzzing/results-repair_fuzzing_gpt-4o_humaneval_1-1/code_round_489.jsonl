The solution should be optimized for speed and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle large values of n\n- Return accurate largest prime factor\n- Optimize performance for quick calculations\n- Ensure solution is scalable\n- Provide user-friendly documentation\nWe will use the sympy library, which is a powerful tool for symbolic mathematics in Python, to efficiently compute the largest prime factor of a given integer. Sympy provides a function called 'primefactors' that can be used to obtain all prime factors of a number, and we can simply return the largest one. This approach ensures accuracy and efficiency, especially for large numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'prime factor'\n    Explanation: A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number itself. The requirement is to find the largest prime factor of the given integer n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means we need to find the biggest prime factor among all prime factors of n.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Use the sympy library's 'primefactors' function to get all prime factors of n.\n    2. Return the largest prime factor from the list obtained.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(2) = 2\n    Explanation: The smallest possible input greater than 1 is 2, which is a prime number itself, so its largest prime factor is 2.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(4) = 2\n    Explanation: The number 4 has prime factors [2, 2], and the largest prime factor is 2.\n    \n    largest_prime_factor(6) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 6 has prime factors [2, 3], and the largest prime factor is 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of sympy's 'primefactors' function inherently handles these cases by returning all prime factors, from which we can select the largest one.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom sympy import primefactors\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the largest prime factor of a given integer n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): An integer greater than 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The largest prime factor of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get all prime factors of n using sympy's primefactors function\n    prime_factors = primefactors(n)\n    \n    # Return the largest prime factor\n    return max(prime_factors)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(largest_prime_factor(2))  # Expected output: 2\n    print(largest_prime_factor(4))  # Expected output: 2\n    print(largest_prime_factor(6))  # Expected output: 3\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 489, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 50}
