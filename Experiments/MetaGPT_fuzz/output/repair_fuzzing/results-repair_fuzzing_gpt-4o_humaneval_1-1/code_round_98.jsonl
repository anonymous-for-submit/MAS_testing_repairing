We will handle edge cases such as empty arrays gracefully by returning an empty list if the input is empty.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers'\n    Explanation: The array consists of integers that are zero or positive, meaning no negative numbers are included.\n\n    'binary representation'\n    Explanation: Each integer in the array is converted to its binary form, and the number of '1's in this form is used for sorting.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'according to number of ones'\n    Explanation: The primary sorting criterion is the count of '1's in the binary representation of each integer.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The integers should be sorted in increasing order based on the number of '1's in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of '1's, they should be sorted by their decimal value.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Check if the input array is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n2. Define a custom key function for sorting:\n   - Convert each integer to its binary representation.\n   - Count the number of '1's in this binary form.\n   - Use a tuple (count_of_ones, original_value) as the key for sorting.\n3. Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with the custom key to sort the array.\n4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([]) = []\n    Explanation: The input array is empty, so the output should also be an empty list.\n\n    sort_array([0, 0, 0]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, which have zero '1's in their binary representation. The order remains unchanged.\n\n    sort_array([3, 7, 8]) = [8, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: Binary representations are 3 ('11'), 7 ('111'), and 8 ('1000'). The counts of '1's are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Sorted by count of '1's and then by value gives [8, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using Python's sorting with a custom key function will handle these cases correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_array(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation.\n    If two numbers have the same number of ones, they are sorted by their decimal value.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A sorted list based on the criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    # Define a custom key function for sorting\n    def custom_sort_key(x: int) -> tuple:\n        # Convert the integer to its binary representation and count the number of '1's\n        count_of_ones = bin(x).count('1')\n        # Return a tuple (count_of_ones, original_value) as the key for sorting\n        return (count_of_ones, x)\n\n    # Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with the custom key to sort the array\n    sorted_array = sorted(arr, key=custom_sort_key)\n\n    # Return the sorted array\n    return sorted_array\n\n# Example usage:\n# sorted_result = sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])\n# print(sorted_result)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 98, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 98}
