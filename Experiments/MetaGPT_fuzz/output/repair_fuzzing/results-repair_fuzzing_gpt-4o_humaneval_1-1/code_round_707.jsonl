Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n    2. Count the number of '1's in each binary representation.\n    3. Use Python's sorting capabilities with a custom key function that sorts first by the count of '1's and then by the decimal value.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([0, 0, 0]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, which have zero '1's in their binary representation, so they remain in their original order.\n\n    sort_array([1, 2, 4, 8]) = [1, 2, 4, 8]\n    Explanation: Each number has exactly one '1' in its binary representation, so they are sorted by their decimal value.\n\n    sort_array([3, 7, 15]) = [3, 7, 15]\n    Explanation: All numbers have more than one '1' in their binary representation but differ in decimal value. They should be sorted by decimal value since they have different counts of '1's.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a custom key function for sorting will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_array(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation.\n    If two numbers have the same number of ones, they are sorted by their decimal value.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a custom key function for sorting\n    def sort_key(x: int) -> tuple[int, int]:\n        # Count the number of '1's in the binary representation of the integer\n        ones_count = bin(x).count('1')\n        # Return a tuple with the count of '1's and the integer itself for secondary sorting\n        return (ones_count, x)\n\n    # Sort the array using the custom key function\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=sort_key)\n\n    return sorted_arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    print(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    print(sort_array([3, 7, 15]))       # Expected output: [3, 7, 15]\n    print(sort_array([0, 0, 0]))        # Expected output: [0, 0, 0]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 707, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 309}
