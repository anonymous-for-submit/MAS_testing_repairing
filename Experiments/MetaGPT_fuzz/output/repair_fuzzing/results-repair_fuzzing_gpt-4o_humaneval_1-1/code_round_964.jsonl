This will allow us to identify and retain only those elements that appear once, while maintaining their original order.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'duplicates'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, duplicates refer to elements in the list that appear more than once. The task is to remove these duplicates and retain only elements that appear once.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'appear once': means that we need to retain elements that have a count of exactly one in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Use the `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the original list and check the count of each element.\n    3. Retain elements that have a count of exactly one, ensuring their original order is maintained.\n    4. Return the list of retained elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    remove_duplicates([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list has no elements, so the expected output is also an empty list.\n    \n    remove_duplicates([1, 1, 1, 1]) = []\n    Explanation: All elements are duplicates, so none should be retained, resulting in an empty list.\n    \n    remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: All elements appear once, so they should all be retained in their original order.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using `collections.Counter` and iterating through the list will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently remove duplicates while maintaining the original order of elements. It should handle large lists without significant performance degradation and provide clear documentation for ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must remove duplicates while maintaining order\n- The function should handle large datasets efficiently\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples\n- Include error handling for non-integer inputs\n- Optimize for minimal memory usage\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the list while maintaining a set to track seen elements. This approach ensures that we maintain the order of elements and efficiently remove duplicates. We will use Python's built-in data structures to achieve this, ensuring minimal memory usage and high efficiency. The function will include comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'remove duplicates'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to remove elements from the list that appear more than once, ensuring that only unique elements remain in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than once': This means any element that appears two or more times in the list should be removed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Create an empty dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the count of each element in the dictionary.\n    3. Create a new list to store elements that appear exactly once.\n    4. Iterate through the original list again, and for each element, check its count in the dictionary.\n    5. If the count is 1, append the element to the new list.\n    6.
