It should handle large strings without performance degradation and provide clear documentation for ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement case-insensitive unique character counting.\n- Optimize performance for large input strings.\n- Ensure the function is easy to use and well-documented.\n- Provide examples for common use cases.\n- Test the function with various string inputs.\nWe will use Python's built-in set data structure to efficiently count unique characters in a string while ignoring case sensitivity. The function will convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity and then use a set to filter out duplicate characters. This approach is optimal for performance, especially with large strings, as set operations are generally fast and efficient.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'unique characters'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to characters that appear only once in the string, ignoring case sensitivity.\n\n    'ignoring case'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store characters from the string, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of unique characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of unique characters is 0.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('aAaA') = 1\n    Explanation: All characters are 'a' in different cases, which are considered the same when ignoring case, so the unique count is 1.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('123abcABC') = 6\n    Explanation: The unique characters are '1', '2', '3', 'a', 'b', and 'c', ignoring case for letters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of a set and converting the string to lowercase inherently handles these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count distinct characters in a string, ignoring case sensitivity.
