We will also ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings and provide clear examples in the docstring.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: This refers to the unique characters present in the string, ignoring any duplicates and considering case insensitivity.\n\n    'regardless of case'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store characters from the string, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('aAaA') = 1\n    Explanation: The string contains only one distinct character 'a', regardless of case.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('123!@#') = 6\n    Explanation: All characters are distinct and non-alphabetic, so each is counted separately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of a set naturally handles duplicates and case insensitivity, and the logic already accounts for empty strings.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to develop a function that counts distinct characters in a string, treating uppercase and lowercase as the same. The function should be efficient and handle large strings gracefully.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count distinct characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large strings.\n- Ensure the function treats uppercase and lowercase characters as the same.\n- Develop a simple user interface for input.\n- Include error handling for non-string inputs.\nWe will implement a function that counts distinct characters in a string, treating uppercase and lowercase as the same. To optimize performance for large strings, we will use Python's built-in set data structure, which allows for efficient membership testing and automatic handling of duplicates. This approach will ensure that the function is both fast and memory-efficient. We will also use the 'str.lower()' method to normalize the case of characters before counting.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to unique characters in the string, ignoring case differences. For example, 'a' and 'A' are considered the same character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the entire string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store characters, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n    3. Iterate through the string and add each character to the set.\n    4. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('aaaa') = 1\n    Explanation: All characters are the same ('a'), so there is only one distinct character.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('AaAa') = 1\n    Explanation: 'A' and 'a' are considered the same due to case insensitivity, resulting in one distinct character.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
