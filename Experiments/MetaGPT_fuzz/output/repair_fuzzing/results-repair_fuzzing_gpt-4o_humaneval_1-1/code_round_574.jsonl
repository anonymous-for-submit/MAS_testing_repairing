We will provide comprehensive documentation with examples to illustrate the function's usage. The function will also handle edge cases, such as when one or both inputs are zero, by defining the GCD of zero and any number as the absolute value of the non-zero number, and the GCD of zero and zero as zero.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'greatest common divisor'\n    Explanation: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

The original logic of taking absolute values and using the Euclidean algorithm inherently handles these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately compute the greatest common divisor of two integers, including handling negative numbers.

The function will handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value of the inputs, ensuring the result is always non-negative. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without additional libraries, as they are sufficient for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'greatest common divisor'\n    Explanation: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n    'non-negative'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the GCD should be non-negative, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': means the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Take the absolute value of both integers to ensure non-negative results.\n    - Implement the Euclidean algorithm:\n        - While b is not zero, set a to b and b to a % b.\n    - Return the final value of a, which is the GCD.\n\n# [edge case] \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: The GCD of zero and zero is defined as zero.\n    \n    greatest_common_divisor(-25, 15) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD should be non-negative, so we take the absolute values of the inputs.\n    \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD of zero and any non-zero number is the non-zero number itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if a == 0 and b == 0:\n            return 0\n        a, b = abs(a), abs(b)\n        (other code using Euclidean algorithm)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Parameters:\n    a (int): First integer, can be negative.\n    b (int): Second integer, can be negative.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The greatest common divisor, always non-negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle the edge case where both numbers are zero\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Take the absolute value of both integers to ensure non-negative results\n    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)\n\n    # Implement the Euclidean algorithm\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 574, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 268}
