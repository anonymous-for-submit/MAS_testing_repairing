It should be efficient enough to handle large strings.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sort characters within words.\n- Ensure punctuation is handled correctly.\n- Optimize performance for large input strings.\n- Add error handling for non-string inputs.\n- Create unit tests to validate functionality.\nWe will implement a function that sorts characters within each word of a string while preserving the order of words and spaces. The function will handle punctuation by treating it as part of the word, sorting it along with letters and numbers. We will use Python's built-in sorted function to achieve this efficiently. The function will be optimized for performance to handle large strings by processing each word individually.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version of it'\n    Explanation: This means that each word in the string should have its characters sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n\n    'preserve the order of words and spaces'\n    Explanation: The function should maintain the original sequence of words and spaces in the input string, only altering the internal character order of each word.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Split the input string into words using spaces as delimiters.\n    2. For each word, sort its characters in ascending order based on ASCII values.\n    3. Join the sorted characters back into a word.\n    4. Reconstruct the sentence by joining the sorted words with spaces, ensuring that the original spacing is preserved.\n    5. Return the reconstructed sentence.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string since there are no words or characters to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('a') = 'a'\n    Explanation: A single character word should return itself as there are no other characters to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('   ') = '   '\n    Explanation: A string with only spaces should return the same string, preserving the spaces.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of splitting by spaces and joining back will naturally handle these cases correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a string input and returns a string where each word's characters are sorted by ASCII value.\n    Preserves the original order of words and spaces.\n    Handles punctuation correctly.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string containing words and spaces.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string with each word's characters sorted by ASCII value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words using spaces as delimiters\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    \n    # Process each word to sort its characters\n    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]\n    \n    # Reconstruct the sentence by joining the sorted words with spaces\n    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(anti_shuffle(\"hello world\"))  # Output: \"ehllo dlorw\"\n    print(anti_shuffle(\"a quick brown fox\"))  # Output: \"a cikqu bnorw fox\"\n    print(anti_shuffle(\"   \"))  # Output: \"   \"\n    print(anti_shuffle(\"a\"))  # Output: \"a\"\n    print(anti_shuffle(\"\"))  # Output: \"\"\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 967, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 376}
