This approach ensures high performance and usability without the need for additional libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum' and 'product'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves calculating the sum and product of a list of integers. The sum is the total of all integers added together, while the product is the result of multiplying all integers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'empty': In the context of the requirement, an empty list should result in a sum of 0 and a product of 1. This is a special case handling for lists with no elements.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize two variables, `total_sum` and `total_product`, to store the sum and product respectively.\n    - Set `total_sum` to 0 and `total_product` to 1 initially.\n    - Iterate through each integer in the list:\n        - Add the integer to `total_sum`.\n        - Multiply `total_product` by the integer.\n    - Return a tuple containing `total_sum` and `total_product`.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: An empty list results in a sum of 0 and a product of 1, as specified in the requirement.\n    \n    sum_product([0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: A list with a single element 0 results in a sum of 0 and a product of 0 because multiplying by zero yields zero.\n    \n    sum_product([1, -1]) = (0, -1)\n    Explanation: The sum of 1 and -1 is 0, and the product is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for empty lists and handles multiplication correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [94, 94, 94, 94, 94, 94, 94, 94, 94, 94], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum and product of a list of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers: List of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Tuple containing sum and product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize sum and product\n    total_sum = 0\n    total_product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to calculate sum and product\n    for number in numbers:\n        total_sum += number\n        total_product *= number\n    \n    return total_sum, total_product\n\n# Edge case examples\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test with an empty list\n    print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)\n    \n    # Test with a list containing zero\n    print(sum_product([0]))  # Expected output: (0, 0)\n    \n    # Test with a list containing positive and negative numbers\n    print(sum_product([1, -1]))  # Expected output: (0, -1)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 309, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 136}
