Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences of the digit '7'.\n    2. Iterate through numbers from 0 to n-1.\n    3. For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.\n    4. If divisible, convert the number to a string and count occurrences of '7'.\n    5. Add the count to the counter.\n    6. Return the final count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fizz_buzz(11) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no numbers less than 11 that are divisible by 11 or 13, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    fizz_buzz(14) = 1\n    Explanation: The number 7 is less than 14 and divisible by itself (7), but not by 11 or 13, so it should not be counted. However, the number 13 is divisible by itself and contains the digit '7', so the expected output is 1.\n    \n    fizz_buzz(26) = 1\n    Explanation: The number 22 is divisible by 11 and contains the digit '7', so the expected output is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already considers numbers strictly less than 'n' and checks for divisibility by 11 or 13.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than 'n' that are divisible by 11 or 13.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The upper limit (exclusive) for checking numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The count of '7's in numbers divisible by 11 or 13 below 'n'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the counter for occurrences of the digit '7'\n    count_of_sevens = 0\n\n    # Iterate over numbers from 0 to n-1\n    for number in range(n):\n        # Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13\n        if number % 11 == 0 or number % 13 == 0:\n            # Convert the number to a string\n            number_str = str(number)\n            # Count occurrences of '7' in the string representation of the number\n            count_of_sevens += number_str.count('7')\n\n    # Return the total count of '7's found\n    return count_of_sevens\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 479, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 33}
