This approach is efficient for large strings due to the average O(1) time complexity for set operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'unique characters'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to characters that appear only once in the string, ignoring case sensitivity.\n\n    'ignoring case'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical, e.g., 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store characters from the string, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of unique characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of unique characters is 0.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('aaaa') = 1\n    Explanation: All characters are the same ('a'), so there is only one unique character.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('AaBbCc') = 3\n    Explanation: Ignoring case, 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the unique characters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of a set inherently handles duplicates and case insensitivity, and an empty string will naturally result in a set size of 0.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count unique characters in a string, ignoring case. It should handle edge cases like empty strings and be optimized for performance with large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count unique characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large strings.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.\n- Include unit tests to verify functionality.\nWe will use Python's built-in set to efficiently count unique characters, converting the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity. This approach is simple and fast, suitable for handling large strings. We will also handle edge cases like empty strings by returning zero.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'unique characters'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to characters that appear only once in the string, ignoring case sensitivity.\n\n    'ignoring case'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
