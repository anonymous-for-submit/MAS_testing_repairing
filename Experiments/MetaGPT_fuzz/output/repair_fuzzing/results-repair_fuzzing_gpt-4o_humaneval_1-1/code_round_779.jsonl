Check if n is less than or equal to 1, and handle it as an invalid input since n > 1 is assumed.\n2. Initialize a variable to store the largest prime factor found.\n3. Divide n by 2 repeatedly until it is odd, updating the largest prime factor to 2 if applicable.\n4. Iterate over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of n.\n   - For each odd number, divide n by it as long as it divides evenly, updating the largest prime factor.\n5. If n is still greater than 2 after the loop, it must be a prime number itself, so update the largest prime factor.\n6.
