Filter out negative numbers from the array since the requirement specifies non-negative integers.\n    2. Convert each integer to its binary form and count the number of '1's.\n    3. Use Python's sorted function with a custom key that sorts first by the count of '1's and then by the decimal value.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_array([0, 0, 0]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, which have zero '1's in their binary form, so they remain in their original order.\n\n    sort_array([1, 2, 4, 8]) = [1, 2, 4, 8]\n    Explanation: Each number has exactly one '1' in its binary form, so they are sorted by their decimal value.\n\n    sort_array([-1, -2, -3]) = []\n    Explanation: Negative numbers are excluded from the sorting process as they are not non-negative integers.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        arr = [x for x in arr if x >= 0]  # Filter out negative numbers\n        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.8584, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8584, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8584], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 97, 113, 113, 113, 113, 97, 113, 113, 97], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_array(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the count of ones in their binary form.\n    For numbers with the same count of ones, sorts by decimal value.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out negative numbers\n    non_negative_arr = [x for x in arr if x >= 0]\n    \n    # Sort the array using a custom key\n    # The key is a tuple: (count of '1's in binary form, decimal value)\n    sorted_arr = sorted(non_negative_arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n    \n    return sorted_arr\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n# print(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n# print(sort_array([-1, -2, -3]))     # Output: []\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 846, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 309}
