Handle the edge case where the list is empty by returning (0, 1).\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so the sum is 0 and the product is set to 1 by default.\n    \n    sum_product([0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: The list contains a single element, 0, so both the sum and product are 0.\n    \n    sum_product([-1, -2, -3]) = (-6, -6)\n    Explanation: The sum of negative numbers is -6, and the product is also -6.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already considers these scenarios by initializing sum and product appropriately and handling empty lists.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately compute the sum and product of a list of integers, handling edge cases such as empty lists by returning (0, 1). It should be optimized for performance, especially with large lists, and should be easy to use without requiring additional setup or libraries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate calculation of sum and product\n- Handle empty list edge case\n- Optimize performance for large lists\n- Ensure ease of use\n- Provide comprehensive documentation\nWe will implement a simple Python function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. The function will handle edge cases such as empty lists by returning a tuple (0, 1). We will use Python's built-in sum function for calculating the sum and the math.prod function for calculating the product, ensuring efficient performance even for large lists. No additional libraries are required, keeping the solution lightweight and easy to use.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum': The total obtained by adding all the integers in the list.\n    'product': The result of multiplying all the integers in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Check if the list is empty.\n    2. If the list is empty, return (0, 1) as the sum and product.\n    3. If the list is not empty, calculate the sum using Python's built-in `sum` function.\n    4. Calculate the product using Python's `math.prod` function.\n    5. Return a tuple containing the sum and product.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so the sum is 0 and the product is 1 by definition.\n    \n    sum_product([0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: The list contains a single element which is 0, so both the sum and product are 0.\n    \n    sum_product([1, -1]) = (0, -1)\n    Explanation: The sum of 1 and -1 is 0, and the product is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
