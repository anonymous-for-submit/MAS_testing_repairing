The function should efficiently handle both small and large lists of operations, providing immediate feedback when the balance is negative.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core function to track balance and detect negative values.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Ensure the function provides immediate feedback.\n- Add logging for debugging purposes.\n- Create a user-friendly interface for inputting operations.\nWe will implement a simple function using Python that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance. If the balance ever drops below zero, the function will immediately return True. This approach ensures immediate feedback and efficient handling of large datasets. We will use the built-in list and integer types, which are optimal for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that the account balance becomes negative at any point during the operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance.\n    - Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    - Update the `balance` by adding each operation value.\n    - Check if `balance` is less than 0 after each update.\n    - If `balance` is less than 0, return True immediately.\n    - If the loop completes without `balance` dropping below 0, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation itself causes the balance to drop below zero, so the function should return True.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations are zero, so the balance never drops below zero, and the function should return False.\n    \n    below_zero([1, -1, 1, -1]) = False\n    Explanation: The balance fluctuates but never drops below zero, so the function should return False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the balance drops below zero during iteration is sufficient.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if the balance goes below zero at any point during the operations.\n\n    Parameters:\n    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the balance goes below zero at any point, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0  # Initialize the starting balance to zero\n\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation  # Update the balance with the current operation\n        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance is below zero\n            return True  # Return True immediately if balance drops below zero\n\n    return False  # Return False if balance never drops below zero\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 844, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 379}
