This approach ensures optimal performance even for large values of n, as it avoids iteration and directly computes the result. The function will be well-documented to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum of numbers from 1 to n'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to calculate the sum of all integers starting from 1 up to and including n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'from 1 to n inclusive': This indicates that the sum should include both the starting number (1) and the ending number (n).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The requirement can be efficiently implemented using the mathematical formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: n * (n + 1) / 2. This formula provides a direct computation without the need for iteration, ensuring optimal performance.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: If n is 0, there are no numbers to sum, so the result should be 0.\n    sum_to_n(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is simply 1.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: If n is negative, there are no positive integers to sum, so the result should be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n <= 0:\n            return 0\n        return n * (n + 1) // 2\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n inclusive using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The upper limit of the range to sum.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of all numbers from 1 to n.\n    \n    Example:\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases where n is less than or equal to 0\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 217, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 51}
