For n >= 4, use a loop to compute each subsequent element by summing the last four elements.\n4. Update the list or array to keep only the last four computed values.\n5. Continue this process until reaching the n-th element.\n6. Return the n-th element.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fib4(0) = 0\n    Explanation: The base case for n=0 is explicitly defined as 0.\n    \n    fib4(1) = 0\n    Explanation: The base case for n=1 is explicitly defined as 0.\n    \n    fib4(2) = 2\n    Explanation: The base case for n=2 is explicitly defined as 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The base cases are already defined in the initial list, and the logic naturally handles these cases by returning the pre-defined values for n < 4.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should compute the fib4 sequence efficiently without using recursion. It should handle base cases directly and use an iterative approach for other values. The function should be optimized for performance and easy to maintain.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the fib4 sequence calculation without recursion.\n- Optimize the function for performance.\n- Ensure the function is well-documented and maintainable.\n- Include test cases to verify the correctness of the function.\n- Consider edge cases and handle them appropriately.\nWe will implement the fib4 sequence calculation using an iterative approach to avoid recursion. This will ensure efficient computation of the sequence, especially for larger values of n. The function will handle base cases directly and use a loop to compute subsequent values. We will use simple list data structures to store intermediate results, which will help in maintaining the code and optimizing performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'Fib4 number sequence'\n    Explanation: This is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it is defined with a different base case and recursive relation. The sequence starts with specific initial values and each subsequent value is the sum of the previous four values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'first few elements': refers to the initial base cases of the sequence, specifically fib4(0), fib4(1), fib4(2), and fib4(3).\n    'n-th element': refers to the position in the sequence for which we need to compute the value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the first four base cases: [0, 0, 2, 0].\n2. If n is less than 4, return the value at index n from the list.\n3. For n >= 4, use a loop to compute the sequence iteratively:\n   - Start from index 4 and go up to n.\n   - Calculate the current value as the sum of the last four values in the list.\n   - Update the list by removing the oldest value and appending the new calculated value.\n4. Return the last value in the list as the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fib4(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly corresponds to the base case defined in the sequence.\n    \n    fib4(3) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly corresponds to the base case defined in the sequence.\n    \n    fib4(4) = 2\n    Explanation: Calculated as fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) + fib4(0) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
