It should handle edge cases like strings shorter than three characters and strings with repeating patterns.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to check for happy strings\n- Optimize the function for performance with large inputs\n- Write comprehensive test cases for various scenarios\n- Document the function usage and edge cases\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the string, checking every set of three consecutive characters to ensure they are distinct. The function will first check if the string length is at least three, returning False if not. For performance optimization, we will use a sliding window approach to minimize redundant checks. The function will be simple and efficient, suitable for integration into larger projects.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'happy'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, a string is considered \"happy\" if its length is at least 3 and every set of 3 consecutive letters are distinct.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 3': This means the string must have a minimum length of 3 to be considered for further checks.\n    Implementation: Check if `len(s) >= 3`.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If so, return False.\n    2. Iterate through the string using a sliding window of size 3.\n    3. For each window, check if all three characters are distinct.\n    4. If any window has non-distinct characters, return False.\n    5. If all windows have distinct characters, return True.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_happy('') = False\n    Explanation: The string is empty, so it does not meet the minimum length requirement of 3.\n    \n    is_happy('ab') = False\n    Explanation: The string length is less than 3, so it cannot be happy.\n    \n    is_happy('abcabcabc') = True\n    Explanation: Every set of 3 consecutive letters ('abc', 'bca', 'cab', etc.) are distinct.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already checks for the minimum length and distinctness of every set of three consecutive characters.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110, 110], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_happy(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the string is happy.
