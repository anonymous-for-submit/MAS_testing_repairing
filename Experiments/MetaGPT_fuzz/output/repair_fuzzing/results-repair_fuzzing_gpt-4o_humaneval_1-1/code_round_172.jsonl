In code, this can be implemented using Python's `bin()` function followed by `count('1')`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The integers should be sorted in increasing order based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted by their decimal value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n    2. Count the number of ones in each binary representation.\n    3. Sort the array using a custom key that first sorts by the number of ones and then by the decimal value for ties.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([0, 0, 0]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All numbers are zero, and their binary representation has zero ones. The sorted order remains unchanged.\n\n    sort_array([1, 2, 4]) = [1, 2, 4]\n    Explanation: Binary representations are '1', '10', and '100', respectively. Each has one '1', so they are sorted by their decimal values.\n\n    sort_array([3, 7, 8]) = [8, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: Binary representations are '11', '111', and '1000'. Number of ones are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Sorted by number of ones first, then by decimal value for ties.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a custom sort key will handle these cases correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately sort arrays based on the number of ones in their binary representation, with ties broken by decimal value. It should handle non-negative integers and provide examples for clarity.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement sorting based on binary representation\n- Ensure performance optimization for large arrays\n- Provide clear documentation and usage examples\n- Handle edge cases like empty arrays\n- Consider extending functionality to negative integers\nWe will implement a function that sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. For numbers with the same count of ones, we will sort them by their decimal value. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this efficiently. The function will handle edge cases like empty arrays and provide clear documentation and examples. We will not extend functionality to negative integers as the requirement is unclear on this aspect.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the array consists of non-negative integers, meaning all numbers are zero or positive.\n\n    'binary representation'\n    Explanation: Each integer should be converted to its binary form to count the number of ones.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'number of ones'\n    Explanation: This refers to counting the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of each integer. In code, this can be implemented using Python's `bin()` function followed by `count('1')`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The integers should be sorted in increasing order based on the number of ones in their binary representation, and for similar counts, by their decimal value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n    2. Count the number of ones in each binary representation.\n    3. Sort the array using a custom key that first sorts by the count of ones and then by the integer value itself.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty array should return an empty array as there are no elements to sort.\n\n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 0 is '0', which contains no ones, so it remains unchanged.\n\n    sort_array([1, 1, 1]) = [1, 1, 1]\n    Explanation: All elements are identical with the same number of ones in their binary representation, so the order remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
