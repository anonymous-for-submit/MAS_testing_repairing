Despite the collision, the cars continue moving in their respective directions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'number of collisions': The requirement specifies that each car from one set will collide with exactly one car from the other set, resulting in n collisions. This means the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in one set.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The logic is straightforward: since each car from one set collides with exactly one car from the opposite set, the number of collisions is equal to n. Therefore, the function should simply return n.\n\n# [edge case]\n    car_race_collision(0) = 0\n    Explanation: If there are no cars (n=0), there can be no collisions, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    car_race_collision(1) = 1\n    Explanation: With one car in each direction, there will be exactly one collision.\n    \n    car_race_collision(1000000) = 1000000\n    Explanation: With a large number of cars, each car from one set will collide with one car from the other set, resulting in 1000000 collisions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of returning n directly handles all cases, including edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other. Each set contains 'n' cars, and they move at the same speed. The function should be efficient and handle large values of 'n' without performance issues.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main collision calculation logic\n- Optimize the function for large inputs\n- Ensure the output is user-friendly\n- Add error handling for invalid inputs\n- Include detailed documentation and examples\nWe will implement a simple function that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other. Since each car from the left set will collide with each car from the right set, the number of collisions will be n * n. This approach is efficient and handles large values of n without performance issues.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'collision'\n    In the requirement, a collision occurs when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left. Despite the collision, cars continue moving in their original direction.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n * n': This indicates that each car from one set will collide with each car from the other set, resulting in n squared collisions.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. The function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars in each set.\n    2. Calculate the total number of collisions as n * n.\n    3. Return the calculated number of collisions.\n\n# [edge case] \n    car_race_collision(0) = 0\n    Explanation: If there are no cars in either set, there can be no collisions.\n    \n    car_race_collision(1) = 1\n    Explanation: With one car in each set, there will be exactly one collision.\n    \n    car_race_collision(1000000) = 1000000000000\n    Explanation: With a large number of cars, the function should handle large values of n efficiently, resulting in 1000000 * 1000000 collisions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
