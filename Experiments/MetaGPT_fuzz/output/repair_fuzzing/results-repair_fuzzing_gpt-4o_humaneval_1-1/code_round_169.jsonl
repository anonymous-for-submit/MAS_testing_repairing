If the index is even and the element is odd, it will be added to the sum. We will use built-in Python functions for simplicity and efficiency. The function will handle large lists efficiently by using a single pass through the list. We will also include comprehensive documentation and examples to ensure clarity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd elements': refers to numbers in the list that are not divisible by 2.\n    'even positions': refers to indices in the list that are divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of odd elements at even positions.\n    2. Iterate over the list using an index.\n    3. For each element, check if the index is even.\n    4. If the index is even, check if the element is odd.\n    5. If both conditions are met, add the element to `total_sum`.\n    6. After iterating through the list, return `total_sum`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The single element is at an even position (index 0) and is odd, so it is included in the sum.\n    \n    solution([2]) = 0\n    Explanation: The single element is at an even position (index 0) but is not odd, so it is not included in the sum.\n    \n    solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 9\n    Explanation: The odd elements at even positions are 1 (index 0) and 5 (index 4), so the sum is 1 + 5 = 6.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for checking both the index and the value of each element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently sum odd numbers located at even indices in a list. It must handle edge cases such as lists with no odd numbers at even indices and ensure compatibility with Python 3.x.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must correctly identify odd numbers at even indices.\n- The function should handle large lists efficiently.\n- The function should include clear documentation and examples.\n- The function should be compatible with Python 3.x.\n- The function should handle edge cases gracefully.\nWe will use built-in Python functions to efficiently iterate over the list and sum the odd numbers located at even indices. This approach ensures compatibility with Python 3.x and handles large lists without performance issues. The function will include a clear docstring with examples to aid understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd elements': refers to numbers that are not divisible by 2.\n    'even positions': refers to indices in the list that are divisible by 2 (0-based index).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable to store the sum of odd elements at even positions.\n    2. Iterate over the list using a loop, checking each element's index.\n    3. For each element, check if the index is even and the element is odd.\n    4. If both conditions are met, add the element to the sum.\n    5. Return the final sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0, which is an odd number, so the sum is 1.\n    \n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are even numbers, so no odd elements are present at even positions, resulting in a sum of 0.\n    \n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) = 15\n    Explanation: Odd elements at even positions are 1 (index 0), 5 (index 2), and 9 (index 4). Their sum is 15.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
