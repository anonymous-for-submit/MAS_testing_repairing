Initialize a variable to store the sum of odd elements at even positions.\n    2. Iterate over the list using a loop, checking each element's index.\n    3. If the index is even and the element is odd, add the element to the sum.\n    4. Return the final sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0, which is an odd number, so the sum is 1.\n    \n    solution([2]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0, which is an even number, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 9\n    Explanation: Odd elements at even positions are 1 (index 0) and 5 (index 4), so the sum is 1 + 5 = 6.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of iterating through the list and checking conditions will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to efficiently compute the sum of odd integers located at even indices in a list. The solution must handle large lists without compromising performance or accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle large lists\n- Accurately compute the sum of odd elements at even positions\n- Optimize performance for better user experience\n- Ensure solution reliability across different input cases\n- Provide clear documentation for user understanding\nWe will implement a function that iterates over the list, checking for odd numbers at even indices. To efficiently handle large lists, we will use list comprehension for concise and fast processing. The function will be optimized to minimize time complexity by avoiding unnecessary operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd elements': refers to numbers in the list that are not divisible by 2.\n    'even positions': refers to indices in the list that are divisible by 2 (0-based index).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Iterate over the list using a loop or list comprehension.\n    2. Check if the index is even (i.e., index % 2 == 0).\n    3. Check if the element at that index is odd (i.e., element % 2 != 0).\n    4. Sum all elements that meet both conditions.\n    5. Return the sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0, which is an odd number, so the sum is 1.\n    \n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements at even positions (indices 0 and 2) are even numbers, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) = 15\n    Explanation: Odd elements at even positions are 1 (index 0), 5 (index 2), and 9 (index 4). Their sum is 15.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
