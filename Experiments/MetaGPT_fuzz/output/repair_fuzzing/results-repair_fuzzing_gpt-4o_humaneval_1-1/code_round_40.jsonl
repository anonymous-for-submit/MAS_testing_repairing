The focus is on efficiency and clarity.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Fib4 sequence function without recursion\n- Ensure the function handles large input values efficiently\n- Maintain code readability and simplicity\n- Include inline comments for clarity\n- Optimize for minimal memory usage\nWe will implement the Fib4 sequence using an iterative approach to ensure efficiency and avoid recursion. This approach will utilize a loop to compute the sequence values, storing only the necessary previous four values to minimize memory usage. The function will be simple and include inline comments for clarity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'Fib4 number sequence'\n    Explanation: This is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but each term is the sum of the previous four terms. The initial terms are defined as fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, and fib4(3) = 0.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'sum of the previous four terms': This indicates that each term in the sequence is calculated by adding the four preceding terms. In code, this can be implemented by maintaining a list or array of the last four computed values and updating it iteratively.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a list or array to store the first four terms: [0, 0, 2, 0].\n    - If n is less than 4, return the nth term directly from the initialized list.\n    - For n >= 4, use a loop to compute each term from fib4(4) to fib4(n).\n    - In each iteration, calculate the current term as the sum of the last four terms.\n    - Update the list or array to include the new term and discard the oldest term.\n    - Return the nth term after completing the loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    fib4(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly returns the initial value defined for fib4(0).\n    \n    fib4(1) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly returns the initial value defined for fib4(1).\n    \n    fib4(2) = 2\n    Explanation: Directly returns the initial value defined for fib4(2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The initial values are predefined and can be directly returned for n < 4.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.027, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 2, 74, 74, 74, 74], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef fib4(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the n-th term of the Fib4 sequence.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The index of the term to compute.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The n-th term of the Fib4 sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first four terms of the Fib4 sequence\n    fib4_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    # If n is less than 4, return the nth term directly from the initialized list\n    if n < 4:\n        return fib4_sequence[n]\n\n    # Iterate to compute the n-th term for n >= 4\n    for i in range(4, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the current term as the sum of the last four terms\n        next_term = sum(fib4_sequence)\n        \n        # Update the list to include the new term and discard the oldest term\n        fib4_sequence = fib4_sequence[1:] + [next_term]\n\n    # Return the nth term after completing the loop\n    return fib4_sequence[-1]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 40, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 40}
