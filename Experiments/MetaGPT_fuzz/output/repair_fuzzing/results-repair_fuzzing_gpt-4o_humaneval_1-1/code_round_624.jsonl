The use of a set naturally handles duplicates and case insensitivity, and the logic already accounts for empty strings.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count distinct characters in a string, ignoring case sensitivity. It should handle edge cases like empty strings and be optimized for performance with large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count distinct characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large strings.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.\n- Conduct performance testing and optimization.\nWe will implement a function that utilizes Python's built-in set data structure to efficiently count distinct characters in a string. The function will convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity and then use a set to extract unique characters. This approach is optimal for performance and accuracy, especially with large strings. We will also handle edge cases such as empty strings by returning zero.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to unique characters in the string, ignoring case differences.
