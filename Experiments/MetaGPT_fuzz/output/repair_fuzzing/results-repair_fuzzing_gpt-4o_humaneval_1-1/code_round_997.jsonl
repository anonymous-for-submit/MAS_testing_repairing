For each element, check if its index is a multiple of 3:\n   - If true, square the element and add it to `total_sum`.\n4. If the index is not a multiple of 3, check if it is a multiple of 4:\n   - If true, cube the element and add it to `total_sum`.\n5. If neither condition is met, add the element as is to `total_sum`.\n6. Return `total_sum`.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sum_squares([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no elements to process, resulting in a sum of 0.\n    \n    sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 0]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, and regardless of their index, the sum remains zero.\n    \n    sum_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 1^2 + 2 + 3 + 4^3 + 5 + 6^2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 64 + 5 + 36 = 111\n    Explanation: Indexes 0 and 6 are multiples of 3, so their elements are squared. Index 4 is a multiple of 4 but not of 3, so its element is cubed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
