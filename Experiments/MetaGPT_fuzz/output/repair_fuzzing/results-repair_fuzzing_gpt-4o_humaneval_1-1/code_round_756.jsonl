The function will iterate over the list, apply transformations based on index conditions, and calculate the sum. Built-in functions are chosen for simplicity and performance, avoiding unnecessary complexity from external libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'multiple of 3': An index is a multiple of 3 if it can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\n    'multiple of 4': An index is a multiple of 4 if it can be divided by 4 without a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'multiple of 3': This means the index % 3 == 0.\n    'multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3': This means the index % 4 == 0 and index % 3 != 0.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the list elements.\n2. Iterate over the list using an index.\n3. For each element, check if its index is a multiple of 3:\n   - If true, square the element.\n4. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3:\n   - Cube the element.\n5. Add the transformed or original element to the sum.\n6. Return the total sum.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sum_squares([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 0]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, so regardless of transformations, the sum remains zero.\n\n    sum_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) = 1^2 + 2 + 3 + 4^3 + 5 + 6^2 + 7 + 8 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 64 + 5 + 36 + 7 + 8 = 126\n    Explanation: Indexes 0 and 6 are multiples of 3, so their elements are squared. Index 4 is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, so its element is cubed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for empty lists and zero values.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to handle different index conditions for squaring and cubing elements, ensuring that the sum is computed correctly. It should be efficient and maintain readability for ease of understanding and maintenance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function logic to handle index-based operations\n- Optimize performance for large lists\n- Ensure accurate handling of negative numbers\n- Provide comprehensive documentation\n- Include test cases for edge scenarios\nWe will implement a simple Python function using built-in capabilities to handle the index-based operations for squaring and cubing elements. The function will iterate over the list, check the index conditions, and apply the appropriate mathematical operation. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency without the need for additional libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'multiple of 3' and 'multiple of 4'\n    Explanation: These are conditions based on the index of the list elements. An index is a multiple of 3 if it can be divided by 3 without a remainder, and similarly for 4.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'multiple of 3': This means the index % 3 == 0.\n    'multiple of 4': This means the index % 4 == 0.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable to store the sum of the entries.\n    - Iterate over the list using a loop.\n    - For each element, check if its index is a multiple of 3:\n        - If true, square the element and add it to the sum.\n    - Else, check if its index is a multiple of 4:\n        - If true, cube the element and add it to the sum.\n    - If neither condition is met, add the element as is to the sum.\n    - Return the final sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_squares([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no elements to process, resulting in a sum of 0.\n    \n    sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 0]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, regardless of their index, resulting in a sum of 0.\n    \n    sum_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 91\n    Explanation: Index 0 (1) is squared to become 1, index 3 (4) is cubed to become 64, and other elements are added as is. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 64 + 5 + 6 = 81.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
