The original logic handles empty lists and zero values naturally.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to efficiently transform list elements based on their index, ensuring correct application of squaring and cubing rules. It should handle edge cases like empty lists and provide clear examples for user understanding.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function logic for index-based transformations.\n- Optimize performance for large lists.\n- Include comprehensive examples in documentation.\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions.\n- Provide error handling for invalid inputs.\nWe will implement the function using pure Python to ensure simplicity and high usability. The function will iterate over the list, applying the specified transformations based on the index of each element. We will use list comprehensions for efficient processing and ensure compatibility with different Python versions. Edge cases like empty lists will be handled gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'multiple of 3'\n    Explanation: An index is a multiple of 3 if it can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\n\n    'multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3'\n    Explanation: An index is a multiple of 4 if it can be divided by 4 without a remainder, and it should not be divisible by 3.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'multiple of 3': means index % 3 == 0\n    'multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3': means index % 4 == 0 and index % 3 != 0\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum.\n2. Iterate over the list using an index.\n3. For each element, check if the index is a multiple of 3:\n   - If true, square the element and add it to `total_sum`.\n4. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3:\n   - Cube the element and add it to `total_sum`.\n5. If neither condition is met, add the element as is to `total_sum`.\n6. Return `total_sum`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_squares([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    sum_squares([0,0,0,0]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, so regardless of squaring or cubing, the sum remains zero.\n    \n    sum_squares([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) = 285\n    Explanation: Index 0 (1) is squared, index 3 (4) is cubed, index 6 (7) is squared. The sum is calculated as: 1^2 + 2 + 3 + 4^3 + 5 + 6 + 7^2 + 8 + 9 = 285.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
