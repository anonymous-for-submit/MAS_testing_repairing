It must handle edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with a single element efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement sorting based on binary representation\n- Handle edge cases such as empty arrays\n- Optimize performance for large arrays\n- Provide clear documentation\n- Ensure compatibility with different data types\nWe will implement a function that sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. For numbers with the same count of ones, we will sort them by their decimal value. We will use Python's built-in sorted function with a custom key to achieve this. The function will handle edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers'\n    Explanation: The array consists of integers that are zero or positive, meaning no negative numbers are included.\n\n    'binary representation'\n    Explanation: Each integer will be converted to its binary form, and the number of '1's in this form will be used for sorting.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The numbers should be sorted from smallest to largest based on the specified criteria.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'similar'\n    Explanation: When two numbers have the same number of '1's in their binary representation, they should be sorted by their decimal value.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n2. Count the number of '1's in each binary representation.\n3. Use Python's `sorted()` function with a custom key that sorts primarily by the count of '1's and secondarily by the decimal value.\n4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty array should return an empty array as there are no elements to sort.\n\n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: A single-element array should return the same array as there is nothing to sort.\n\n    sort_array([3, 7, 8]) = [8, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: In binary, 3 is '11', 7 is '111', and 8 is '1000'. The number of '1's are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. So, 8 comes first, followed by 3 and then 7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using Python's `sorted()` function with a custom key will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113, 113], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_array(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation.\n    For numbers with the same count of ones, sorts by decimal value.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a custom key function for sorting\n    def sort_key(x: int) -> tuple[int, int]:\n        # Count the number of '1's in the binary representation of x\n        ones_count = bin(x).count('1')\n        # Return a tuple with the count of '1's and the number itself\n        return (ones_count, x)\n\n    # Use the sorted function with the custom key\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=sort_key)\n\n    return sorted_arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(sort_array([]))  # Expected output: []\n    print(sort_array([0]))  # Expected output: [0]\n    print(sort_array([3, 7, 8]))  # Expected output: [8, 3, 7]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 568, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 309}
