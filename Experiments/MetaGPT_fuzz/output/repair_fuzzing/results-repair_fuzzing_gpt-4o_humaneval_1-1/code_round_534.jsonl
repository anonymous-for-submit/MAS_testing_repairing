The original logic of splitting, sorting, and reconstructing handles these cases naturally.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should take a string input and return a string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending ASCII order. It must preserve the original order of words and spaces. The function should handle punctuation and be efficient with large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sort characters within each word.\n- Ensure the function maintains the order of words and spaces.\n- Handle punctuation correctly within the words.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large strings.\n- Add error handling for non-string inputs.\nWe will implement a function that processes a string by splitting it into words, sorting the characters of each word based on their ASCII values, and then reconstructing the sentence while preserving the original spaces. We will use Python's built-in 'sorted' function for sorting characters within each word. The function will handle punctuation by treating them as part of the words they are attached to, ensuring they are sorted along with the letters. This approach will efficiently handle large strings due to the optimized nature of Python's sorting algorithms.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that each word in the string should have its characters sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending': means that characters should be sorted from smallest to largest based on ASCII values.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Split the input string into words while preserving spaces.\n    2. For each word, sort the characters based on their ASCII values using Python's built-in 'sorted' function.\n    3. Reconstruct the sentence by joining the sorted words while maintaining the original spaces.\n    4. Return the reconstructed sentence.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string as there are no words to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('a b c') = 'a b c'\n    Explanation: Each word is a single character, so sorting does not change the order.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('   ') = '   '\n    Explanation: A string with only spaces should return the same string as there are no words to sort.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of splitting and sorting will naturally handle these cases correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a string and returns an ordered version of it where each word's characters are sorted in ascending ASCII order.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string containing words and spaces.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string with each word's characters sorted, maintaining the original order of words and spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into words while preserving spaces\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    \n    # Sort characters in each word based on their ASCII values\n    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]\n    \n    # Reconstruct the sentence by joining the sorted words while maintaining the original spaces\n    ordered_sentence = ' '.join(sorted_words)\n    \n    return ordered_sentence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(anti_shuffle('hello world'))  # Output: 'ehllo dlorw'\n    print(anti_shuffle('a b c'))        # Output: 'a b c'\n    print(anti_shuffle('   '))          # Output: '   '\n    print(anti_shuffle(''))             # Output: ''\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 534, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 288}
