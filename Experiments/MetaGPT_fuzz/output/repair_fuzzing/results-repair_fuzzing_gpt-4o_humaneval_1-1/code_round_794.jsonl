{"task_id": "HumanEval/115", "prompt": "def max_fill(grid, capacity):\t\n'''You are given a rectangular grid of wells, and each row represents a single well where each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water. Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, and all buckets have the same capacity. Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells. Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\nExample 1:\n        Input: \n            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]\n            bucket_capacity : 1\n        Output: 6\n\n

We will ensure the function handles edge cases such as empty grids or maximum capacity efficiently. The function will be documented with examples and edge case handling.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid of wells'\n    Explanation: This refers to a 2D list where each sublist represents a row of wells, and each element in the sublist is either 0 or 1, indicating the presence or absence of water.\n\n    'bucket capacity'\n    Explanation: This is the maximum number of water units a bucket can hold at one time. It determines how many times you need to lower the bucket to empty the wells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'number of times'\n    Explanation: This refers to the total number of operations needed to lower the bucket to extract all the water from the wells. In code, this can be implemented by dividing the total number of 1s by the bucket capacity and rounding up to account for any remainder.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the total number of bucket operations.\n2. Iterate over each row in the grid.\n3. For each row, count the number of 1s (units of water).\n4. Calculate the number of bucket operations needed for that row by dividing the count of 1s by the bucket capacity and rounding up.\n5. Add this number to the total counter.\n6. Return the total counter as the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no units of water in any well, so no bucket operations are needed.\n\n    max_fill([[1,1,1], [1,1,1]], 3) = 2\n    Explanation: Each row has exactly 3 units of water, which matches the bucket capacity, so each row requires exactly one operation.\n\n    max_fill([[1,0,1], [0,1,0]], 2) = 2\n    Explanation: The first row has 2 units of water and requires one operation. The second row has 1 unit of water and requires another operation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for cases with no water and cases where the number of water units is less than or equal to the bucket capacity.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to efficiently calculate the number of times buckets need to be lowered to empty the wells.
