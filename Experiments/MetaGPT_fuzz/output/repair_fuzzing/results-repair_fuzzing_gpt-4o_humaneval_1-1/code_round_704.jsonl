Return True if the result is an integer, otherwise return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    simplify(\"1/1\", \"1/1\") = True\n    Explanation: Both fractions are equal to 1, and their multiplication results in 1, which is an integer.\n    \n    simplify(\"2/3\", \"3/2\") = True\n    Explanation: The multiplication results in 1, which is an integer.\n    \n    simplify(\"5/7\", \"7/5\") = True\n    Explanation: The multiplication results in 1, which is an integer.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic of checking if the denominator of the resulting fraction is 1 will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to parse string representations of fractions, multiply them, and determine if the result is an integer. It should handle valid inputs efficiently and return a boolean value.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement fraction parsing and multiplication.\n- Determine if the product of fractions is an integer.\n- Optimize the function for performance.\n- Handle large numbers efficiently.\n- Ensure the function is easy to use and understand.\nWe will use the 'fractions' module from Python's standard library to handle the parsing and multiplication of fractions. This module provides a Fraction class that can easily handle arithmetic operations and check if the result is an integer. The function will convert the string inputs into Fraction objects, multiply them, and check if the resulting fraction has a denominator of 1, which indicates that it is an integer.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'fraction'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves working with fractions, which are numbers expressed as the quotient of two integers, a numerator and a denominator.\n\n    'integer'\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to check if the result of multiplying two fractions is an integer, meaning a whole number without any fractional part.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
