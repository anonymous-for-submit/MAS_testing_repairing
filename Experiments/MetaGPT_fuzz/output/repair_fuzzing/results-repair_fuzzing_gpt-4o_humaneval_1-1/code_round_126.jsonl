Convert the input number to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.\n    2. Initialize two counters, one for even digits and one for odd digits.\n    3. Iterate over each digit in the number:\n        - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n        - For each digit, convert it back to an integer and check if it is even or odd.\n        - Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.\n    4. Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 is considered an even digit, so the count of even digits is 1 and odd digits is 0.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-111) = (0, 3)\n    Explanation: All digits are odd, so the count of even digits is 0 and odd digits is 3.\n    \n    even_odd_count(2222) = (4, 0)\n    Explanation: All digits are even, so the count of even digits is 4 and odd digits is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of converting the number to its absolute value and iterating over each digit will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count even and odd digits in any integer, including negative numbers. It should be optimized for performance to handle large integers efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate counting of even and odd digits\n- Handle negative integers correctly\n- Optimize for performance with large numbers\n- Provide clear and concise output\n- Include error handling for non-integer inputs\nWe will implement a function that iterates through each digit of the integer, checking if it is even or odd, and count them accordingly. The function will handle negative numbers by converting them to positive before processing. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to ensure optimal performance, especially for large integers. The function will return a tuple with counts of even and odd digits. We will also include error handling for non-integer inputs by raising a ValueError.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even' and 'odd'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, 'even' refers to digits that are divisible by 2 without a remainder, while 'odd' refers to digits that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'quantity of even and odd digits': This means we need to count the number of even and odd digits in the given integer.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
