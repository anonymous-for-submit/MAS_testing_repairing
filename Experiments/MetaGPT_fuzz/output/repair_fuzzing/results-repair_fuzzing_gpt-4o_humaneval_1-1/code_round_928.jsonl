This approach ensures efficient computation. We will handle the edge case where n is zero by returning zero directly. The function will include a detailed docstring with examples to enhance user understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum of numbers from 1 to n'\n    Explanation: This refers to the arithmetic series where you add all integers starting from 1 up to the integer n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Check if n is zero. If so, return 0 immediately as the sum of numbers up to zero is zero.\n    2. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    3. Return the calculated sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: When n is zero, there are no numbers to sum, so the result is zero.\n    sum_to_n(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is simply 1.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Since the requirement does not specify behavior for negative numbers, we assume the sum is zero as there are no positive integers to add.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is negative.\n        if n <= 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code using the arithmetic series formula)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.\n    If n is zero or negative, return 0.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range to sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)\n        1\n        >>> sum_to_n(0)\n        0\n        >>> sum_to_n(-5)\n        0\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 928, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 51}
