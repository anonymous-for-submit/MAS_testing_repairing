If it is, we will reverse its case using the built-in Python string method `swapcase()`. Non-letter characters will remain unchanged. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, especially for large strings, as it processes each character in constant time.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'reverse its case'\n    Explanation: This means changing lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Iterate over each character in the string.\n    - Check if the character is a letter using `isalpha()`.\n    - If it is a letter, use `swapcase()` to reverse its case.\n    - If it is not a letter, keep it unchanged.\n    - Return the modified string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"\") = \"\"\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string as there are no characters to process.\n    \n    solve(\"1234\") = \"1234\"\n    Explanation: Since all characters are non-letters, they remain unchanged.\n    \n    solve(\"aBcD\") = \"AbCd\"\n    Explanation: Each letter's case is reversed, resulting in \"AbCd\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
