For integers with the same number of ones, we will sort them by their decimal value. To ensure performance optimization for large arrays, we will utilize Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function. This approach leverages Python's efficient sorting algorithm while allowing us to define a specific sorting criterion.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers'\n    Explanation: The array consists of integers that are zero or positive, meaning no negative numbers are included.\n\n    'binary representation'\n    Explanation: Each integer will be converted to its binary form, and the number of '1's in this form will be used for sorting.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The integers should be sorted from the smallest to the largest based on the number of '1's in their binary representation, and for ties, by their decimal value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n    2. Count the number of '1's in each binary representation.\n    3. Use Python's built-in sorting function with a custom key that sorts first by the count of '1's and then by the integer value itself.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_array([0, 0, 0]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, which have zero '1's in their binary representation, so they remain in their original order.\n    \n    sort_array([3, 7, 8]) = [8, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: Binary representations are '11', '111', and '1000'. The counts of '1's are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Sorted by count of '1's gives [8, 3, 7].\n    \n    sort_array([5, 3, 10]) = [3, 5, 10]\n    Explanation: Binary representations are '101', '11', and '1010'. The counts of '1's are 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Sorted by decimal value gives [3, 5, 10].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using Python's built-in sorting with a custom key function will handle these cases correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8584, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8584, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 113, 113, 113, 97, 113, 113, 113, 97, 113], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef sort_array(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation.\n    For integers with the same number of ones, sorts by decimal value.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (List[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    List[int]: A sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def custom_sort_key(x: int) -> tuple:\n        \"\"\"\n        Custom key function for sorting.\n        \n        Parameters:\n        x (int): A non-negative integer.\n        \n        Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the count of '1's in the binary representation of x and x itself.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Convert the integer to binary and count the number of '1's\n        ones_count = bin(x).count('1')\n        return (ones_count, x)\n    \n    # Sort the array using the custom key\n    sorted_array = sorted(arr, key=custom_sort_key)\n    \n    return sorted_array\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_array = [3, 7, 8, 5, 3, 10]\n    sorted_result = sort_array(example_array)\n    print(f\"Sorted array: {sorted_result}\")\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 442, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 218}
