We will handle edge cases for n < 4 by returning predefined values directly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'Fib4 number sequence'\n    Explanation: This is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but each term is the sum of the previous four terms. The sequence starts with specific values for the first four terms.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n-th element': Refers to the position in the sequence for which we need to compute the value. In code, this is implemented by iterating up to the n-th position.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'efficiently': Indicates that the solution should be optimized for performance, avoiding recursion and minimizing space usage.\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a list or array to store the first four values of the sequence: [0, 0, 2, 0].\n    - If n is less than 4, return the pre-defined value directly.\n    - Use a loop to compute values from the 5th position up to the n-th position.\n    - In each iteration, calculate the next value as the sum of the last four values.\n    - Update the list or array to keep only the last four computed values.\n    - Return the value at the n-th position.\n\n# [edge case]\n    fib4(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly return the pre-defined value for n = 0.\n    \n    fib4(1) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly return the pre-defined value for n = 1.\n    \n    fib4(3) = 0\n    Explanation: Directly return the pre-defined value for n = 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already includes direct returns for n < 4.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef fib4(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence.\n\n    The Fib4 sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but each term is the sum of the previous four terms.\n    The sequence starts with specific values for the first four terms: [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position in the sequence for which we need to compute the value.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The n-th element of the Fib4 sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Predefined values for the first four terms of the sequence\n    initial_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    # Handle edge cases where n is less than 4\n    if n < 4:\n        return initial_values[n]\n\n    # Initialize the list to store the last four computed values\n    last_four_values = initial_values[:]\n\n    # Compute the sequence iteratively from the 5th position up to the n-th position\n    for i in range(4, n + 1):\n        next_value = sum(last_four_values)\n        # Update the list to keep only the last four computed values\n        last_four_values = last_four_values[1:] + [next_value]\n\n    # Return the value at the n-th position\n    return last_four_values[-1]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 343, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 40}
