We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle lists efficiently, ensuring the function performs well even with large lists of operations. Edge cases such as empty lists or lists with net zero effect will be handled gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'balance': refers to the current amount of money in the bank account after each operation.\n    'below zero': indicates that the balance is less than zero, meaning the account is overdrawn.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'zero balance': means the initial balance of the account is 0.\n    'falls below zero': means the balance becomes negative.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance.\n    2. Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    3. Update the `balance` by adding the current operation value.\n    4. Check if `balance` is less than zero after each update.\n    5. If `balance` is less than zero, return True immediately.\n    6. If the loop completes without `balance` falling below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([]) = False\n    Explanation: There are no operations, so the balance remains at zero, which is not below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations have a net zero effect, so the balance remains at zero, which is not below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([-1, 1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation causes the balance to fall below zero, even though subsequent operations bring it back to zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for these scenarios by checking if the balance falls below zero during iteration.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently iterate through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance and checking if it ever falls below zero. It should handle edge cases such as an empty list or operations that sum to zero without errors.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function logic to track balance changes.\n- Optimize for performance with large lists of operations.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty lists.\n- Provide clear documentation and examples for users.\n- Consider additional features like transaction categorization.\nWe will implement a simple function that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance. The function will check if the balance ever falls below zero and return True if it does, otherwise False. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle the list efficiently, ensuring performance even with large lists. Edge cases such as empty lists will be handled gracefully by returning False, as no operations mean the balance cannot fall below zero.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to check if the balance of the account ever falls below zero during the sequence of operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'zero balance': The account starts with a balance of zero, and we need to track changes to this balance based on the operations provided.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `balance` to zero.\n    - Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    - Update the `balance` by adding each operation value.\n    - Check if `balance` falls below zero after each update.\n    - If it does, return True immediately.\n    - If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([]) = False\n    Explanation: With no operations, the balance remains at zero, so it cannot fall below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations have a net zero effect, so the balance remains at zero throughout.\n    \n    below_zero([-1, 1, 0]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation causes the balance to fall below zero immediately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
