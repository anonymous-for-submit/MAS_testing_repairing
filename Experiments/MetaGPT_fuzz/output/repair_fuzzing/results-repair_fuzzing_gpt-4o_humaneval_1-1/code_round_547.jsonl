Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum.\n2. Iterate over the list using an index.\n3. For each index, check if it is a multiple of 3:\n   - If true, square the element at that index and add it to `total_sum`.\n4. If the index is not a multiple of 3, check if it is a multiple of 4:\n   - If true, cube the element at that index and add it to `total_sum`.\n5. If neither condition is met, add the element as is to `total_sum`.\n6. Return `total_sum`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_squares([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no elements to process, resulting in a sum of 0.\n\n    sum_squares([0, 0, 0, 0]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, and any power of zero is still zero, resulting in a sum of 0.\n\n    sum_squares([1, -1, 1, -1]) = -1\n    Explanation: Index 0 (multiple of 3) is squared (1^2 = 1), index 3 (multiple of 4) is cubed (-1^3 = -1), and indices 1 and 2 remain unchanged. The sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The function will iterate over the list, applying the specified transformations based on the index of each element. We will use a simple loop to check the index conditions and apply the appropriate mathematical operation. This approach will handle edge cases like empty lists naturally and will be efficient for moderately large lists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'multiple of 3' and 'multiple of 4'\n    Explanation: These terms refer to the index positions in the list.
