If it is not in the set, add it to the set and include it in the result list.\n    5. Return the result list containing only unique elements.\n\n# [edge case]\n    remove_duplicates([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list has no elements, so the expected output is also an empty list.\n\n    remove_duplicates([1, 1, 1, 1]) = []\n    Explanation: All elements are duplicates, so they should be removed, resulting in an empty list.\n\n    remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: All elements are unique, so none are removed, and the output is the same as the input.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a set to track seen elements and a list comprehension to filter out duplicates will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently remove duplicates from a list of integers while preserving the order of the first occurrence of each element. It should be optimized for large inputs and provide clear documentation for users.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently remove duplicates from a list\n- Preserve the order of first occurrences\n- Handle large inputs effectively\n- Provide clear documentation\n- Optimize memory usage\nWe will use a combination of a set to track seen elements and a list to maintain the order of first occurrences. This approach ensures that we efficiently remove duplicates while preserving the order of elements. The set provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups, which is crucial for handling large inputs effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'remove duplicates'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to remove elements that appear more than once in the list, ensuring that only unique elements remain.\n\n    'efficient solutions'\n    Explanation: The requirement emphasizes the need for a solution that can handle large inputs effectively, suggesting the use of data structures or algorithms with optimal time complexity.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than once': This indicates that any element appearing more than one time in the list should be removed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
