We will ensure the function is easy to integrate into larger systems by keeping it simple and well-documented.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum': The total obtained by adding all the integers in the list.\n    'product': The result of multiplying all the integers in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

Calculate the product by iterating through the list and multiplying each element.\n    5. Return a tuple containing the sum and product.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so by definition, the sum is 0 and the product is 1.\n    \n    sum_product([0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: The list contains a single element which is 0, so the sum is 0 and the product is also 0.\n    \n    sum_product([1, -1]) = (0, -1)\n    Explanation: The sum of 1 and -1 is 0, and their product is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for an empty list by returning (0, 1), and handles other cases naturally through iteration and calculation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately compute the sum and product of a list of integers, including handling edge cases like empty lists.

For performance optimization, we will use efficient iteration techniques to handle large lists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum' and 'product'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to calculate both the sum and the product of all integers in the list.
