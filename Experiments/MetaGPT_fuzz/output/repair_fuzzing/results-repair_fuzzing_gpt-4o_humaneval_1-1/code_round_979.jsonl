This approach ensures both accuracy and performance, making it suitable for handling large values of n. The built-in pow function is highly efficient and optimized for modular arithmetic, which aligns with our requirement for efficient computation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'modulo'\n    Explanation: In mathematics, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. In this requirement, it means calculating the remainder when 2 raised to the power of n is divided by p.\n\n    'efficient for large values of n'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the solution should be optimized to handle very large values of n without running into performance issues or excessive computation time.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrase showing quantity relationship in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'efficient'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the solution should be efficient, particularly for large values of n. This implies using an algorithm that minimizes computational complexity and time, such as using Python's built-in pow function with three arguments for modular exponentiation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Use Python's built-in pow function with three arguments: pow(2, n, p).\n    2. This function efficiently computes (2^n) % p using an optimized algorithm.\n    3. Return the result of the pow function.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: Any number to the power of 0 is 1, so 2^0 % 101 is 1.\n    \n    modp(1, 1) = 0\n    Explanation: 2^1 is 2, and 2 % 1 is 0 because any number modulo 1 is always 0.\n    \n    modp(1000000, 2) = 0\n    Explanation: Any power of 2 is even, and any even number modulo 2 is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of Python's built-in pow function with three arguments inherently handles these cases efficiently.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    Calculate 2^n % p efficiently using Python's built-in pow function.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The exponent value.\n    p (int): The modulus value.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The result of 2^n % p.\n    '''\n    # Use Python's built-in pow function with three arguments to compute (2^n) % p\n    result = pow(2, n, p)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases to verify the function works correctly\n    print(modp(0, 101))  # Expected output: 1\n    print(modp(1, 1))    # Expected output: 0\n    print(modp(1000000, 2))  # Expected output: 0\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 979, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 443}
