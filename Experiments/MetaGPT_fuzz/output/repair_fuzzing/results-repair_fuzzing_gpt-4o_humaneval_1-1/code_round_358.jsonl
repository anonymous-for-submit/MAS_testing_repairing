If valid, it will proceed to calculate the area using Heron's formula and round the result to two decimal places. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle large numbers efficiently, as Python's int type can handle arbitrarily large values. We will also ensure that the function returns -1 for invalid triangles.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'valid triangle'\n    Explanation: A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
