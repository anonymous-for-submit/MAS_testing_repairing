It must accurately detect any point where the balance falls below zero, providing reliable results for users concerned about overdrafts.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient algorithm for balance tracking\n- Ensure accurate detection of negative balance\n- Optimize for large datasets\n- Provide clear documentation for user understanding\n- Enhance user interface for better experience\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function will return True. This approach ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without any additional libraries, as they are sufficient for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, it means that the balance of the bank account becomes negative at any point during the operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance of the account.\n    2. Iterate through each operation in the list:\n        a. Add the operation value to `balance`.\n        b. Check if `balance` is less than 0.\n        c. If `balance` is less than 0, return True immediately.\n    3. If the loop completes without `balance` falling below 0, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation itself makes the balance negative, so the function should return True.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations are zero, so the balance never falls below zero, and the function should return False.\n    \n    below_zero([1, -1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance becomes negative after the third operation, so the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the balance falls below zero during iteration is sufficient to handle all edge cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if the balance falls below zero at any point during the operations.\n\n    Parameters:\n    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the balance to 0\n    balance = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each operation in the list\n    for operation in operations:\n        # Update the balance with the current operation\n        balance += operation\n        \n        # Check if the balance is less than 0\n        if balance < 0:\n            # Return True if the balance falls below zero\n            return True\n    \n    # Return False if the balance never falls below zero\n    return False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 546, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 295}
