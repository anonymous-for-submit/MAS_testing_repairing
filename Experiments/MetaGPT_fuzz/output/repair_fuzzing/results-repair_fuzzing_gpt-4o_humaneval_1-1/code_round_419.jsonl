It must accurately track the account balance and immediately return True if the balance falls below zero at any point, ensuring reliability and user trust.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to track account balance.\n- Ensure real-time feedback when balance goes below zero.\n- Optimize for handling large lists of operations.\n- Test for edge cases such as consecutive withdrawals.\n- Consider user interface elements for displaying balance status.\nWe will implement a simple function that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running total of the account balance. If at any point the balance drops below zero, the function will immediately return True. This approach ensures real-time feedback and is efficient for handling large lists of operations. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without additional libraries, as they are sufficient for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that the account balance becomes negative at any point during the operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance.\n    - Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    - For each operation, update the `balance` by adding the operation value.\n    - Check if the `balance` is below zero after each update.\n    - If `balance` is below zero, return True immediately.\n    - If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation itself causes the balance to drop below zero, so the function should return True.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations are zero, so the balance never drops below zero, and the function should return False.\n    \n    below_zero([1, -1, 1, -1]) = False\n    Explanation: The balance fluctuates but never drops below zero, so the function should return False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the balance drops below zero during iteration is sufficient.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Determines if the account balance drops below zero at any point during the operations.\n\n    Args:\n        operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the balance drops below zero at any point, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0  # Initialize the starting balance\n\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation  # Update the balance with the current operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True  # Return True immediately if balance drops below zero\n\n    return False  # Return False if balance never drops below zero\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 419, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 259}
