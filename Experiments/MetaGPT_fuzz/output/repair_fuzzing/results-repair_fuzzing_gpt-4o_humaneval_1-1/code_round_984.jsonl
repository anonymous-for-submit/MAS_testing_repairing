This approach ensures accuracy and performance, especially for large strings.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that we should count the overlapping appearances of the substring in the original string. For example, in the string \"aaaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears three times: \"aa\" (starting at index 0), \"aa\" (starting at index 1), and \"aa\" (starting at index 2).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Import the 're' module to use regular expressions.\n    2. Use the `re.finditer()` function to find all overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.\n    3. Count the number of matches found by `re.finditer()`.\n    4. Return the count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: The empty substring is considered to appear at every position between characters and at the start and end of the string. Therefore, it appears four times in 'abc'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code using re module)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count all instances of a substring within a string, including overlapping occurrences.

This approach ensures accuracy in counting overlapping substrings. We will avoid using complex regex solutions to maintain simplicity and efficiency. The function will handle edge cases such as empty strings by returning 0 when the main string or substring is empty.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, 'overlapping' means that the function should count instances where the substring appears in the original string, even if these instances overlap with each other.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function should iterate through the original string using a sliding window approach. At each position, it checks if the substring matches the current slice of the original string. If a match is found, it increments a counter and continues to the next position, allowing for overlapping matches.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    \n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: The empty substring is considered to appear at every position in the original string, including before the first character and after the last character. Therefore, it appears four times in 'abc'.\n    \n    how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') = 3\n    Explanation: The substring 'aa' appears three times in 'aaaa' when considering overlapping occurrences: positions 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case of an empty substring.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count overlapping occurrences of a substring within a string, handling edge cases such as empty strings and ensuring performance efficiency for large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate counting of overlapping substrings\n- Handle edge cases like empty strings\n- Optimize performance for large strings\n- Provide clear documentation\n- Include examples for better understanding\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the string and counts overlapping occurrences of the substring.
