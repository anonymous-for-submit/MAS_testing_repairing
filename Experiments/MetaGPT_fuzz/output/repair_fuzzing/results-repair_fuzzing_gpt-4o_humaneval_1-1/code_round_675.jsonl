The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are intense. They are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->

The function will calculate the absolute difference between each pair of corresponding elements in the lists. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle list operations efficiently. The function will be optimized to handle large datasets by leveraging list comprehensions, which are both concise and performant. We will ensure that the function can handle negative numbers as part of the input. For simplicity and performance, we will assume that inputs are strictly integers, as handling non-integer inputs would require additional validation and conversion logic.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'absolute difference'\n    Explanation: The absolute difference between two numbers is the non-negative difference between them, calculated as |a - b|.
