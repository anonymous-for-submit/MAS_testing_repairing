If the character is a letter, we will reverse its case using the built-in string method. If the string contains no letters, we will reverse the entire string. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'reverse its case'\n    Explanation: This means changing uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n\n    'reverse the string'\n    Explanation: This means reversing the order of characters in the string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
