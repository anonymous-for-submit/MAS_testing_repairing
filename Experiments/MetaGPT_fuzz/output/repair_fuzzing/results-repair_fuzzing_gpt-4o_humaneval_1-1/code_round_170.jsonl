The original logic of checking the balance after each operation will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently determine if any sequence of operations results in a negative balance. It must handle both small and large lists of operations, ensuring performance and accuracy. The documentation should be clear to facilitate ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core function to detect negative balance.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Ensure the function is well-documented and easy to understand.\n- Add additional test cases for edge scenarios.\n- Consider user feedback for further improvements.\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle the list operations efficiently, ensuring the function performs well even with large datasets. The function will be documented with clear examples to ensure ease of understanding and use.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that the balance of the account should be checked to see if it ever becomes negative during the sequence of operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance.\n    - Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    - Update the `balance` by adding the current operation value.\n    - Check if `balance` is less than 0 after each update.\n    - If `balance` is less than 0, return True immediately.\n    - If the loop completes without `balance` falling below 0, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation itself makes the balance negative, so the function should return True.\n    \n    below_zero([0]) = False\n    Explanation: A zero operation does not change the balance, so it remains zero and never falls below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([1, -1, 1, -1]) = False\n    Explanation: The balance oscillates between 0 and positive values but never falls below zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
