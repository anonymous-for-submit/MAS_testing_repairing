Initialize an empty list to store the prime factors.\n    2. Start dividing the number by the smallest prime (2) and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible.\n    3. Move to the next possible divisor and repeat the process until the number becomes 1.\n    4. Append each divisor to the list of prime factors as many times as it divides the number.\n    5. Return the list of prime factors sorted from smallest to largest.\n\n# [edge case] \n    factorize(1) = []\n    Explanation: The number 1 has no prime factors, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    \n    factorize(0) = []\n    Explanation: The number 0 cannot be factorized into prime numbers, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    \n    factorize(-8) = []\n    Explanation: Negative numbers are not typically factorized into prime factors, so the expected output is an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n <= 1:\n            return []\n        (other code for factorization)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.\n    Each factor must be repeated in the list as many times as it occurs in the factorization process.\n    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to be factorized.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: List of prime factors in ascending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases where n is less than or equal to 1\n    if n <= 1:\n        return []\n\n    prime_factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n\n    # Continue factorization until n becomes 1\n    while n > 1:\n        # Check if the current divisor is a factor of n\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            prime_factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        # Move to the next possible divisor\n        divisor += 1\n\n    return prime_factors\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 703, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 187}
