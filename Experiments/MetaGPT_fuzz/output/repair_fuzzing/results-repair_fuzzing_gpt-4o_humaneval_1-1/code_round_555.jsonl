The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are definitely worth noting down. It can be interesting when you start comparing them with others. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->

The function will assume that both input lists are of equal length and contain integer values.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'absolute difference'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves calculating the absolute difference between the actual score and the guessed score for each match.
