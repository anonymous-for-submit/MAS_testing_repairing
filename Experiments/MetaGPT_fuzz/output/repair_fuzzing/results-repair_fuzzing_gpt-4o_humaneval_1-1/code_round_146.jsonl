The function will handle punctuation by treating them as part of the words they are attached to.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the function should return a version of the input string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending': means that the characters in each word should be sorted from the smallest to the largest ASCII value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Split the input string into words while preserving spaces.\n    2. For each word, sort its characters using the sorted() function.\n    3. Reconstruct the sentence by joining the sorted words while maintaining the original order of words and spaces.\n    4. Return the reconstructed sentence.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string as there are no words to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('a b c') = 'a b c'\n    Explanation: Each word is a single character, so sorting does not change them.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('123 321') = '123 123'\n    Explanation: Sorting the characters in '321' results in '123', while '123' remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of splitting, sorting, and reconstructing will naturally handle these cases correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should take a string input and return a version where each word's characters are sorted by ASCII value. It must preserve the original order of words and spaces, handling special characters appropriately.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sort characters in each word\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings and special characters\n- Optimize the function for performance with large inputs\n- Add comprehensive test cases for various input scenarios\n- Document the function usage and examples\nWe will implement a function that processes the input string by splitting it into words, sorting the characters of each word based on their ASCII values, and then reconstructing the string while preserving the original order of words and spaces. We will use Python's built-in sorted function for sorting characters efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version'\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, an \"ordered version\" of a string means that each word in the string is transformed such that its characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

Reconstruct the string by joining the sorted words while preserving the original order of words and spaces.\n    4. Return the reconstructed string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string since there are no words to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('a') = 'a'\n    Explanation: A single character word should return itself as there are no other characters to sort.\n    \n    anti_shuffle('   ') = '   '\n    Explanation: A string with only spaces should return the same number of spaces since there are no words to sort.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
