For each operation, update the balance by adding the operation value to the current balance.\n    4. Check if the updated balance is less than zero.\n    5. If the balance is below zero at any point, return True.\n    6. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The single operation is a withdrawal that immediately takes the balance below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations are zero, so the balance never changes from zero.\n\n    below_zero([1, -1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance goes to zero after the first two operations and then falls below zero with the third operation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the balance falls below zero during iteration will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to efficiently track the balance of a bank account through a series of operations and determine if it ever falls below zero. It should handle both small and large lists of operations, providing accurate and timely results.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to check for negative balance.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Ensure the function provides clear and concise output.\n- Add error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Include logging for debugging purposes.\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the list of operations, maintaining a running balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle the list operations efficiently, ensuring the function can process large datasets quickly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'balance'\n    Explanation: The balance refers to the current amount of money in the bank account after each operation (deposit or withdrawal) is applied.\n\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: This means the balance becomes negative, indicating that withdrawals have exceeded deposits.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `balance` to zero to represent the starting balance of the account.\n    2. Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    3. Update the `balance` by adding the current operation value (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals).\n    4. Check if the `balance` falls below zero after each operation.\n    5. If the balance is below zero at any point, return True.\n    6. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([-1]) = True\n    Explanation: The first operation is a withdrawal of 1, which immediately causes the balance to fall below zero.\n\n    below_zero([0]) = False\n    Explanation: A zero operation does not change the balance, so it remains at zero and does not fall below zero.\n\n    below_zero([1, -1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance starts at 1, then falls to 0 after the second operation, and finally falls below zero after the third operation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
