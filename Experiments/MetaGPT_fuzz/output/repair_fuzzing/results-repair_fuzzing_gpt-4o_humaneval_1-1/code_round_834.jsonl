The function must preserve the original order of words and spaces, handling punctuation correctly.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sort characters within each word.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings and punctuation.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large input strings.\n- Add comprehensive test cases to validate functionality.\n- Document the function usage and edge cases.\nWe will implement a function that processes a string by splitting it into words, sorting the characters of each word, and then reconstructing the string while preserving the original spaces and punctuation. We will use Python's built-in sorted function to sort the characters within each word. The function will handle edge cases such as empty strings, punctuation, and multiple spaces between words.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version of it'\n    Explanation: This means that each word in the string should have its characters sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n\n    'keep the order of words and blank spaces'\n    Explanation: The original sequence of words and spaces in the input string should remain unchanged in the output.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Split the input string into a list of words and spaces.\n    2. For each word, sort its characters in ascending order using the `sorted` function.\n    3. Reconstruct the string by joining the sorted words with their original spaces.\n    4. Return the reconstructed string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string since there are no words or spaces to process.\n\n    anti_shuffle('   ') = '   '\n    Explanation: A string with only spaces should return the same number of spaces, as there are no words to sort.\n\n    anti_shuffle('a b c') = 'a b c'\n    Explanation: Each word is a single character, so sorting does not change them, and the spaces should be preserved.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of splitting by spaces and sorting each word individually will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a string input and returns a new string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending ASCII order.\n    Preserves the original order of words and spaces, handling punctuation correctly.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The ordered version of the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the input string into a list of words and spaces\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    \n    # Sort characters in each word\n    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]\n    \n    # Reconstruct the string with sorted words, preserving original spaces\n    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(anti_shuffle('hello world'))  # Output: 'ehllo dlorw'\n    print(anti_shuffle('a b c'))        # Output: 'a b c'\n    print(anti_shuffle('   '))          # Output: '   '\n    print(anti_shuffle(''))             # Output: ''\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 834, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 334}
