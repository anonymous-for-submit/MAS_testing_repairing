The collections.OrderedDict will be used to preserve the order of elements as it inherently maintains the order of insertion. This approach is optimal for handling large datasets due to its efficiency in both time and space complexity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'eliminate all elements that occur more than once'\n    Explanation: This means that any integer appearing more than once in the list should be removed entirely from the list.\n\n    'maintaining the order of elements'\n    Explanation: The remaining elements after removal should appear in the same order as they did in the original list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than once': This indicates that any integer appearing two or more times should be removed from the list.\n    Implementation: Use a frequency count to identify elements that appear more than once and remove them.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
