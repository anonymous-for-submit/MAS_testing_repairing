The original logic using `sorted()` with a custom key will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted by their decimal value. The examples provided in the requirements illustrate the expected behavior of the function.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement sorting based on binary representation\n- Handle edge cases with negative numbers\n- Optimize for performance with large arrays\n- Provide clear documentation and examples\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a function that sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they will be sorted by their decimal value. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this. The function will handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays with a single element. We will not handle negative numbers as the requirement specifies non-negative integers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the array consists of integers that are zero or positive, meaning no negative numbers should be considered.\n\n    'binary representation'\n    Explanation: Each integer in the array should be converted to its binary form to count the number of ones.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'quantity of ones'\n    Explanation: This refers to the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of each integer. In code, this can be implemented using the `bin()` function to convert a number to binary and then using `count('1')` to count the ones.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'ascending order'\n    Explanation: The numbers should be sorted from smallest to largest based on the specified criteria (number of ones, then decimal value).\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.\n2. Count the number of ones in each binary representation.\n3. Sort the array based on the number of ones. If two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them by their decimal value.\n4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty array should return an empty array as there are no elements to sort.\n\n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: An array with a single element should return the same element as there is nothing to compare or sort.\n\n    sort_array([1, 1, 1]) = [1, 1, 1]\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so the sorted array remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of sorting based on binary ones and then by decimal value will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8673, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8584, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [113, 113, 98, 113, 113, 113, 97, 113, 113, 113], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_array(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation.\n    If two numbers have the same number of ones, they are sorted by their decimal value.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    list[int]: A sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a custom key function for sorting\n    def sort_key(x: int) -> tuple:\n        # Convert the number to binary and count the number of '1's\n        ones_count = bin(x).count('1')\n        # Return a tuple with the number of ones and the number itself\n        return (ones_count, x)\n\n    # Sort the array using the custom key function\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=sort_key)\n    \n    return sorted_arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n    print(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n    print(sort_array([]))               # Expected output: []\n    print(sort_array([0]))              # Expected output: [0]\n    print(sort_array([1, 1, 1]))        # Expected output: [1, 1, 1]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 972, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 465}
