Implement error handling for cases like division by zero and invalid operators.\n\n# [edge case]\n    do_algebra(['+'], [1, 2]) = 3\n    Explanation: The simplest case with one operator and two operands, resulting in 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n    do_algebra(['//'], [5, 0]) = Error or Exception\n    Explanation: Floor division by zero should raise an error or exception.\n\n    do_algebra(['**', '+'], [2, 3, 0]) = 9\n    Explanation: The expression evaluates as 2 ** 3 + 0 = 8 + 0 = 8.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Operator list must have one less element than operand list.\")\n        \n        try:\n            expression = str(operand[0])\n            for i in range(len(operator)):\n                expression += f\" {operator[i]} {operand[i+1]}\"\n            result = eval(expression)\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n        except Exception as e:\n            return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n        \n        return result\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 79, 79, 79, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef do_algebra(operator: list[str], operand: list[int]) -> int:\n    '''\n    Constructs and evaluates an algebraic expression from the given operators and operands.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    operator (list[str]): A list of algebraic operators.\n    operand (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The result of the evaluated expression.\n    \n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the operator list length is not equal to operand list length minus one.\n    ZeroDivisionError: If division by zero occurs.\n    '''\n    \n    # Validate the input lists\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Operator list must have one less element than operand list.\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Construct the algebraic expression\n        expression = str(operand[0])\n        for i in range(len(operator)):\n            expression += f\" {operator[i]} {operand[i+1]}\"\n        \n        # Evaluate the expression using eval\n        result = eval(expression)\n        \n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return \"Error: Division by zero.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n    \n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 402, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 257}
