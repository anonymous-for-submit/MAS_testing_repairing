It should be efficient and easy to use, providing results in a simple tuple format.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must handle positive, negative, and zero values.\n- The function should return a tuple with counts of even and odd digits.\n- The function should be optimized for performance.\n- The function should have a simple and intuitive interface.\n- The function should include error handling for non-integer inputs.\nWe will implement a simple function that iterates over the digits of the integer, checking each digit to determine if it is even or odd. The function will handle negative numbers by converting them to positive before processing. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently handle the integer input and return the result as a tuple. The function will also include basic error handling to ensure non-integer inputs are managed gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even and odd digits'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. Even digits are those divisible by 2, while odd digits are not.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the integer to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.\n    2. Initialize two counters, one for even digits and one for odd digits.\n    3. Iterate over each digit of the integer:\n        - Convert the digit to an integer.\n        - Check if the digit is even (digit % 2 == 0) and increment the even counter if true.\n        - Otherwise, increment the odd counter.\n    4. Return a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 has one digit which is even.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-101) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The number -101 has one even digit (0) and two odd digits (1, 1).\n    \n    even_odd_count(222) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 222 has three even digits and no odd digits.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
