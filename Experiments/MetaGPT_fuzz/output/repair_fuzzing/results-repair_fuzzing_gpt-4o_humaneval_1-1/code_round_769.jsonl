To ensure case insensitivity, we will convert the string to lowercase before processing. This approach is optimal for performance as set operations are generally fast and suitable for handling large strings. The function will be simple to integrate into existing projects due to its straightforward interface.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: This refers to the unique characters present in the string, ignoring any duplicates. For example, in the string 'xyzXYZ', the distinct characters are 'x', 'y', and 'z', regardless of their case.\n\n    'regardless of case'\n    Explanation: This means that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical. For example, 'X' and 'x' should be considered the same character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store characters from the string, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('aaaa') = 1\n    Explanation: All characters are the same, so there is only 1 distinct character.\n    \n    count_distinct_characters('AaAa') = 1\n    Explanation: The function is case insensitive, so 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of a set and converting to lowercase inherently handles these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately count distinct characters in a string, ignoring case sensitivity. It should be optimized for performance, especially with large strings, and provide clear documentation for ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate counting of distinct characters\n- Performance optimization for large strings\n- Case insensitivity in character counting\n- Clear and concise documentation\n- User-friendly function interface\nWe will implement a function that counts distinct characters in a string, ignoring case sensitivity. We will use Python's built-in set data structure to efficiently handle distinct character counting, as it automatically handles uniqueness. This approach is optimal for performance, especially with large strings, due to the average O(1) time complexity for insertions in a set. We will also provide clear documentation and examples for ease of use.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count unique characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. This means 'a' and 'A' are considered the same character.\n\n    'regardless of case'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the function should treat uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as identical, so 'a' and 'A' are not counted separately.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
