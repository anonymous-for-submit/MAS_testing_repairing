The function will utilize Python's built-in set data structure to efficiently handle distinct character counting. This approach ensures optimal performance even with large input strings. We will also handle special characters and spaces by considering all characters in the string. The function will include basic error handling to ensure that non-string inputs are managed gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distinct characters'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count unique characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity.
