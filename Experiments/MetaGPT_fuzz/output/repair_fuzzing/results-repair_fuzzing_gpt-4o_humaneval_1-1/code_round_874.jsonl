It is a fundamental concept in number theory and is used to find the remainder of a division operation.\n\n    'power'\n    Explanation: 'Power' refers to the mathematical operation of exponentiation, where a number (the base) is raised to the power of another number (the exponent). In this requirement, it involves computing 2 raised to the power of n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'raised to the power of': This indicates an exponential relationship where 2 is multiplied by itself n times.
