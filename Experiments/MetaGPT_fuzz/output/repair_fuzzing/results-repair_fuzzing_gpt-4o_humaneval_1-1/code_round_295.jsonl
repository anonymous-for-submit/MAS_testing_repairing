Return the final result after all operations have been applied.\n\n# [edge case] \n    do_algebra(['+'], [0, 0]) = 0\n    Explanation: Both operands are zero, and addition of zero results in zero.\n    \n    do_algebra(['**'], [2, 0]) = 1\n    Explanation: Exponentiation with zero as the exponent results in one (2**0 = 1).\n    \n    do_algebra(['//'], [5, 0]) = Error or undefined\n    Explanation: Floor division by zero is undefined and should raise an error.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Operator list length must be one less than operand list length.\")\n        \n        result = operand[0]\n        for i in range(len(operator)):\n            if operator[i] == '+':\n                result += operand[i + 1]\n            elif operator[i] == '-':\n                result -= operand[i + 1]\n            elif operator[i] == '*':\n                result *= operand[i + 1]\n            elif operator[i] == '//':\n                if operand[i + 1] == 0:\n                    raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n                result //= operand[i + 1]\n            elif operator[i] == '**':\n                result **= operand[i + 1]\n        return result\n"], "scores": [0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 1.0, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124, 0.6124], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [79, 79, 79, 79, 129, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef do_algebra(operator: list[str], operand: list[int]) -> int:\n    '''\n    Evaluates an algebraic expression based on the given operators and operands.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    operator (list[str]): A list of algebraic operators ('+', '-', '*', '//', '**').\n    operand (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The result of the evaluated expression.\n    \n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the operator list length is not one less than the operand list length.\n    ZeroDivisionError: If a division by zero is attempted.\n    '''\n    # Validate that the length of the operator list is one less than the length of the operand list\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Operator list length must be one less than operand list length.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result with the first operand\n    result = operand[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the operator list and apply each operator to the current result and the next operand\n    for i in range(len(operator)):\n        if operator[i] == '+':\n            result += operand[i + 1]\n        elif operator[i] == '-':\n            result -= operand[i + 1]\n        elif operator[i] == '*':\n            result *= operand[i + 1]\n        elif operator[i] == '//':\n            if operand[i + 1] == 0:\n                raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n            result //= operand[i + 1]\n        elif operator[i] == '**':\n            result **= operand[i + 1]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported operator: {operator[i]}\")\n    \n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 295, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 209}
