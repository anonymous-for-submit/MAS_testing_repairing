The function will be optimized for performance by using a single pass through the list, ensuring it handles large datasets efficiently. Edge cases such as an empty list or operations that sum to zero will be considered. The function will strictly process integer operations as per the requirement.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'below zero'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to check if the balance of the account ever falls below zero during the sequence of operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to represent the starting balance.\n    - Iterate through each operation in the list.\n    - Update the `balance` by adding each operation value.\n    - If at any point `balance` becomes less than 0, return True.\n    - If the loop completes without `balance` falling below zero, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([]) = False\n    Explanation: An empty list means no operations, so the balance never changes and remains zero, which is not below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([0, 0, 0]) = False\n    Explanation: All operations are zero, so the balance remains zero throughout, which is not below zero.\n    \n    below_zero([-1, 1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance starts at 0, goes to -1 after the first operation, which is below zero, so the function returns True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already considers these scenarios by checking if the balance falls below zero during iteration.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if the balance falls below zero at any point during the sequence of operations.\n\n    Parameters:\n    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero\n\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation  # Update the balance with the current operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero\n\n    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 2, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 2}
