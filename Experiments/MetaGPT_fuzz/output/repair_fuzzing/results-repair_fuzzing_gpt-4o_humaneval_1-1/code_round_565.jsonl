If the position is even and the element is odd, it will be added to the sum. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to ensure efficient handling of large lists. The function will include clear documentation to explain its purpose and usage. Negative numbers will be considered odd if they are not divisible by 2.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd elements at even positions'\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that we need to identify elements that are odd numbers and are located at even indices in the list. In Python, list indices start at 0, so even positions are indices like 0, 2, 4, etc.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of odd elements at even positions.\n    - Iterate over the list using a loop with index tracking.\n    - For each element, check if the index is even using `index % 2 == 0`.\n    - If the index is even, check if the element is odd using `element % 2 != 0`.\n    - If both conditions are met, add the element to `sum`.\n    - Return the final value of `sum`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0 (an even position), and it is odd, so the sum is 1.\n    \n    solution([2]) = 0\n    Explanation: The list has only one element at index 0 (an even position), but it is not odd, so the sum is 0.\n    \n    solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 4\n    Explanation: Odd elements at even positions are 1 (index 0) and 3 (index 2), so the sum is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already considers all elements and checks their positions and values accordingly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should iterate over the list, checking each element's position. If the position is even and the element is odd, it should be added to the sum. The function must handle edge cases such as very large lists and lists with no odd elements at even positions.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to sum odd elements at even positions.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large lists.\n- Write comprehensive documentation and examples.\n- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x.\n- Consider edge cases and write tests for them.\nWe will use built-in Python functions to iterate over the list and sum the odd elements located at even positions. This approach is simple and efficient for handling large lists, as it avoids the overhead of importing additional libraries. The function will be optimized for performance by using list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'odd elements': refers to integers that are not divisible by 2.\n    'even positions': refers to indices in the list that are divisible by 2 (0-based index).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
