We will handle edge cases by returning 0 when no even numbers are found at odd indices.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even elements': refers to numbers in the list that are divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n    'odd indices': refers to positions in the list that are odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable `sum_even` to 0 to keep track of the sum of even numbers at odd indices.\n    2. Iterate over the list using an index.\n    3. For each element, check if the index is odd.\n    4. If the index is odd, check if the element is even.\n    5. If both conditions are met, add the element to `sum_even`.\n    6.
