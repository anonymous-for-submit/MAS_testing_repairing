The original logic of using a counter to track unmatched brackets will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should correctly identify whether a sequence of brackets is properly matched. It should handle edge cases such as empty strings and unbalanced brackets efficiently. Performance is crucial for handling large inputs, and the function should be well-documented for ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main bracket validation logic\n- Optimize the function for performance with large inputs\n- Write comprehensive documentation and examples\n- Include additional test cases for edge scenarios\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a function to validate bracket sequences using a simple stack-based approach. This method efficiently checks for matching brackets by pushing open brackets onto a stack and popping them when a matching close bracket is encountered. This approach ensures linear time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs. We will use Python's built-in list as a stack for optimal performance. Comprehensive documentation will be provided to explain the function's usage and edge case handling.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'matching close bracket'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that for every open bracket '(', there must be a corresponding close bracket ')' that appears after it in the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

If the character is a close bracket ')':\n        - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False because there is no matching open bracket.\n        - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.\n    5. After iterating through the string, check if the stack is empty.\n        - If it is empty, return True because all open brackets have matching close brackets.\n        - If it is not empty, return False because there are unmatched open brackets.\n\n# [edge case] \n    correct_bracketing(\"\") = True\n    Explanation: An empty string has no brackets, so technically all brackets are matched.\n    \n    correct_bracketing(\"(((((\") = False\n    Explanation: There are only open brackets with no matching close brackets.\n\n    correct_bracketing(\"(()))\") = False\n    Explanation: There is an extra close bracket without a matching open bracket.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
