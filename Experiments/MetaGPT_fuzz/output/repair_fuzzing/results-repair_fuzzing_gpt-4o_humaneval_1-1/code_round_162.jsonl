The function will ensure that the operators and operands are combined correctly, respecting operator precedence. We will use the 'operator' module from Python's standard library to map string operators to their corresponding functions, ensuring efficient and accurate calculations. Error handling will be included to manage invalid inputs, such as mismatched list lengths or unsupported operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'algebraic expression'\n    Explanation: This refers to a mathematical phrase that can include numbers, operators, and sometimes variables. In this requirement, it involves combining numbers (operands) with operations (operators) to form a valid expression.\n\n    'operator precedence'\n    Explanation: This is the rule that defines the order in which operations are performed in an expression. For example, multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'equal to': The length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one.
