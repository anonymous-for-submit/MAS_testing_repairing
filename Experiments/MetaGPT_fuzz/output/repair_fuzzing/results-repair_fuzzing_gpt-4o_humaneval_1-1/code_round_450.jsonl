It is a fundamental concept in number theory.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': means the largest integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:\n        - If either number is zero, return the absolute value of the other number.\n        - Use a loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm: replace the larger number with the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number, until one of the numbers becomes zero.\n        - Return the absolute value of the non-zero number as the GCD.\n\n# [edge case] \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD of 0 and any non-zero integer is the absolute value of the non-zero integer.\n    \n    greatest_common_divisor(-3, -9) = 3\n    Explanation: The GCD should be positive, even if both numbers are negative. The GCD of 3 and 9 is 3.\n    \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: The GCD of two zeros is conventionally defined as 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if a == 0:\n            return abs(b)\n        elif b == 0:\n            return abs(a)\n        elif a == 0 and b == 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code using Euclidean algorithm)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases where one or both numbers are zero\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif a == 0:\n        return abs(b)\n    elif b == 0:\n        return abs(a)\n\n    # Implement the Euclidean algorithm\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(greatest_common_divisor(48, 18))  # Output: 6\n# print(greatest_common_divisor(-3, -9))  # Output: 3\n# print(greatest_common_divisor(0, 5))    # Output: 5\n# print(greatest_common_divisor(0, 0))    # Output: 0\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 450, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 9}
