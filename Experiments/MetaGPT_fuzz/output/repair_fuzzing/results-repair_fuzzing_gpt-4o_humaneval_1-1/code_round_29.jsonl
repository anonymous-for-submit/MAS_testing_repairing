The function should be accurate and handle edge cases like 1 and even numbers effectively.\nrequirement pool:\n- Optimize for large inputs\n- Ensure accurate prime detection\n- Handle edge cases like 1 and even numbers\n- Provide efficient performance\n- Document the function for user understanding\nWe will implement a function using the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm that can efficiently determine if a number is prime, especially suitable for large inputs. This approach balances efficiency and accuracy, and is widely used for large numbers. We will use the 'sympy' library to leverage its optimized functions for primality testing.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'prime'\n    Explanation: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n    'optimize for large inputs'\n    Explanation: The requirement emphasizes the need for an efficient algorithm to handle large numbers, suggesting the use of advanced techniques like probabilistic tests or optimized libraries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'efficiently'\n    Explanation: The solution should be able to handle large inputs quickly, implying the need for an algorithm with a low time complexity.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Check if the number is less than or equal to 1, return False as it is not prime.\n    2. Check if the number is 2 or 3, return True as these are prime numbers.\n    3. If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, return False.\n    4. Use a loop to check divisibility from 5 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 6 (to skip even numbers and multiples of 3).\n    5. If any divisor is found, return False.\n    6. If no divisors are found, return True.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_prime(0) = False\n    Explanation: 0 is not a prime number as it does not meet the definition of having exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n    \n    is_prime(1) = False\n    Explanation: 1 is not a prime number as it only has one positive divisor (itself).\n\n    is_prime(2) = True\n    Explanation: 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already considers numbers less than or equal to 1 and handles them appropriately.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.9857, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 0, 69, 70, 70], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a number is prime using the Miller-Rabin test.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to test for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 1\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Use sympy's isprime function which implements the Miller-Rabin test\n    return isprime(n)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 29, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 29}
