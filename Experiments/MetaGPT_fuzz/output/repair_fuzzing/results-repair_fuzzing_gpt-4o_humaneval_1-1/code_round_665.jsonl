Convert each character back to an integer and check if it is even or odd.\n    6. Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.\n    7. Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 is considered an even digit, so the count of even digits is 1 and odd digits is 0.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-111) = (0, 3)\n    Explanation: All digits are odd, so the count of even digits is 0 and odd digits is 3.\n    \n    even_odd_count(222) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: All digits are even, so the count of even digits is 3 and odd digits is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

It should be optimized for performance, especially for large integers, and provide results in a clear tuple format.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate counting of even and odd digits\n- Handle negative integers correctly\n- Optimize performance for large integers\n- Provide clear output format\n- Ensure compatibility with various integer types\nWe will implement a function that iterates over each digit of the integer, checking if it is even or odd. We will handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value of the integer. The function will be optimized for performance by using simple arithmetic operations and will return the result as a tuple. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle large integers efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even and odd digits'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.
