The function will handle negative numbers by converting them to positive before processing. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to ensure the function is efficient and straightforward, without the need for additional libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even' and 'odd'\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, 'even' refers to digits that are divisible by 2 without a remainder, while 'odd' refers to digits that have a remainder when divided by 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

Check if the digit is even or odd by converting it back to an integer and using modulo operation.\n    6. Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.\n    7. Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 is considered an even digit, so the count of even digits is 1 and odd digits is 0.\n    \n    even_odd_count(-101) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The digits are 1, 0, and 1. The digit 0 is even, and the digits 1 are odd, resulting in counts of (1, 2).\n    \n    even_odd_count(222) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: All digits are even, so the count of even digits is 3 and odd digits is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
