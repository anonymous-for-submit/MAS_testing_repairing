The function should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and examples provided.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the heap sort algorithm\n- Ensure the function is efficient and performs well\n- Provide documentation and usage examples\n- Test compatibility across different Python versions\n- Optimize for large datasets\nWe will implement the heap sort algorithm using Python's built-in heapq library, which provides efficient heap operations. This will ensure the function is both efficient and easy to understand. The function will handle edge cases like empty lists and non-integer elements by raising appropriate exceptions.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'heap sort'\n    Explanation: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving it to the sorted region.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Import the heapq library to utilize its heap operations.\n    2. Convert the input list into a heap using heapq.heapify().\n    3. Initialize an empty list to store the sorted elements.\n    4. Use a loop to extract the smallest element from the heap using heapq.heappop() and append it to the sorted list.\n    5. Continue until all elements are extracted from the heap.\n    6. Return the sorted list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    heap_sort([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list is already sorted, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    \n    heap_sort([5]) = [5]\n    Explanation: A single-element list is already sorted, so the expected output is the same single-element list.\n    \n    heap_sort([3, 3, 3]) = [3, 3, 3]\n    Explanation: A list with all identical elements is already sorted, so the expected output is the same list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of heap sort will naturally handle these cases correctly.\n"], "test": ["def check(heap_sort):\n\tassert heap_sort([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0])==[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]",
