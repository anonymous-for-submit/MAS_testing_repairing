We will use Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities to split the input string into words and filter them based on their length. The function will handle large text inputs efficiently by leveraging list comprehensions for concise and fast execution. We will also ensure that the function is well-documented with examples to aid understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'words': In the context of this requirement, words are sequences of characters separated by spaces in the input string.\n    'length of at least 4 characters': This means that the words must have a minimum of four characters to be included in the result.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 4 characters': This indicates that the length of the word should be greater than or equal to four. In code, this can be implemented using a condition like `len(word) >= 4`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1.

It should handle lists of varying lengths and types, ensuring that the mapping between elements is consistent.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core function logic to compare patterns\n- Optimize the function for performance with large inputs\n- Write comprehensive tests to cover edge cases\n- Document the function usage with examples\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. The function will map elements from the first list to the second list and ensure that the mapping is consistent. We will use Python's built-in data structures to achieve this efficiently. The function will handle edge cases such as lists of different lengths by returning False immediately if the lengths differ.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sequence'\n    Explanation: The requirement is about checking if two lists follow the same sequence or pattern. This means that the elements in the first list should map consistently to the elements in the second list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

Compare the two sums and return True if they are equal, otherwise return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    areEquivalent(1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: The only divisor of 1 is itself, so both numbers have a sum of divisors equal to 1.\n    \n    areEquivalent(0, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Divisors are typically defined for positive numbers, so this case is not valid under normal divisor definitions.\n\n    areEquivalent(6, 28) = False\n    Explanation: The sum of divisors for 6 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12, and for 28 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56. Since these sums are not equal, the function should return False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if num1 <= 0 or num2 <= 0:\n            return False\n        (other code)\n"], "test": ["def check(areEquivalent):\n\tassert areEquivalent(36,57) == False", "def check(areEquivalent):\n\tassert areEquivalent(2,4) == False", "def

We will ensure the function is case-sensitive as the requirement does not specify case insensitivity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sequence \"std\"'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find how many times the exact sequence of characters 'std' appears in the given string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Define the function `count_occurance` that takes a string as input.\n    2. Use the built-in string method `.count()` to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string.\n    3. Return the count obtained from the `.count()` method.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_occurance(\"\") = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so 'std' cannot appear, resulting in a count of 0.\n    \n    count_occurance(\"std\") = 1\n    Explanation: The string is exactly 'std', so it appears once.\n    \n    count_occurance(\"stdd\") = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence 'std' appears once at the beginning of the string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of the `.count()` method inherently handles these cases by returning 0 when the substring is not found and counting exact matches correctly.\n"], "test": ["def

It should handle various string inputs and provide results quickly.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm for finding the longest palindromic subsequence.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large input strings.\n- Provide detailed documentation and examples for user understanding.\n- Include interactive examples to demonstrate the function's usage.\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions.\nWe will implement a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. This approach will use a 2D table to store the lengths of palindromic subsequences for different substrings, ensuring high performance even for large input strings. We will utilize Python's built-in capabilities without any external libraries, as the problem is algorithmic in nature and does not require additional dependencies.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'palindromic subsequence'\n    Explanation: A palindromic subsequence is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. It does not need to be contiguous within the original string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'longest': Refers to finding the subsequence with the maximum length that satisfies the palindromic property.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'longest': Indicates that among all possible palindromic subsequences, we need to find the one with the greatest length.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.\n    2. Set `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`, since a single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n    3. Iterate over the length of substrings from 2 to n (length of the string).\n    4. For each substring length, iterate over all possible starting indices.\n    5. If the characters at the start and end of the current substring are the same, set `dp[start][end] = dp[start+1][end-1] + 2`.\n    6. Otherwise, set `dp[start][end] = max(dp[start+1][end], dp[start][end-1])`.\n    7. The result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    lps(\"\") = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the longest palindromic subsequence is of length 0.\n    \n    lps(\"A\") = 1\n    Explanation: A single character is a palindrome by itself, so the longest palindromic subsequence is of length 1.\n    \n    lps(\"AB\") = 1\n    Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence can only be one of the characters, either 'A' or 'B', so the length is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The dynamic programming approach inherently handles these cases by initializing single character palindromes and considering empty substrings.\n"], "test": ["def check(lps):\n\tassert lps(\"TENS FOR

Return the new tuple containing the maximum values for each position.\n\n# [edge case] \n    maximize_elements((), ()) = ()\n    Explanation: Both tuples are empty, so the result is also an empty tuple.\n    \n    maximize_elements(((1, 2),), ((3, 4),)) = ((3, 4),)\n    Explanation: The function should handle single-element tuples correctly, returning the maximum for each position.\n\n    maximize_elements(((5, 6), (7, 8)), ((5, 6), (7, 8))) = ((5, 6), (7, 8))\n    Explanation: When both tuples have identical elements, the result should be the same as the input tuples.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using `zip` and `max` will naturally handle empty tuples and single-element tuples correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently compare elements of two tuples and return a new tuple with the maximum values from each position. It should handle edge cases such as tuples of different lengths and provide clear error messages if inputs are invalid.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function logic to compare tuple elements\n- Ensure the function handles tuples of varying lengths\n- Provide documentation and examples for user guidance\n- Optimize the function for large datasets\n- Maintain compatibility with Python 3.x\nWe will implement a function called maximize_elements that takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples containing the maximum values at each position. The function will handle tuples of different lengths by raising an error, as this ensures data integrity and avoids assumptions about missing data. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently compare and construct the resulting tuple. The function will be optimized for large datasets by leveraging tuple comprehensions and will be compatible with Python 3.x.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum value'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the maximum value between corresponding elements of two tuples of tuples.\n\n    'tuples'\n    Explanation: A tuple is an ordered collection of elements, which can be compared element-wise.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': means that for each position in the tuples, we need to select the larger value between the two tuples.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Check if both input tuples have the same length. If not, raise an error.\n    2. Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n    3. For each pair of sub-tuples, compare corresponding elements and select the maximum value.\n    4. Construct a new tuple of tuples with these maximum values.\n    5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5)), ((6, 7), (3, 9))) = ((6, 7), (4, 9))\n    Explanation: Each element is compared with its counterpart, and the maximum is selected.\n    \n    maximize_elements(((1, 3),), ((6, 7),)) = ((6, 7),)\n    Explanation: Single element tuples are compared directly.\n\n    maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5)), ((6, 7),))
