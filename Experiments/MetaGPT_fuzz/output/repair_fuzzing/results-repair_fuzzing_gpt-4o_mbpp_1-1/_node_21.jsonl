We will use Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities to split the input string into words and filter them based on their length. The function will handle large text inputs efficiently by leveraging list comprehensions for concise and fast execution. We will also ensure that the function is well-documented with examples to aid understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'words': In the context of this requirement, words are sequences of characters separated by spaces in the input string.\n    'length of at least 4 characters': This means that the words must have a minimum of four characters to be included in the result.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 4 characters': This indicates that the length of the word should be greater than or equal to four. In code, this can be implemented using a condition like `len(word) >= 4`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Split the input string into individual words using the `split()` method.\n2. Iterate over each word and check if its length is greater than or equal to 4.\n3. Collect all words that meet this condition into a list.\n4.
