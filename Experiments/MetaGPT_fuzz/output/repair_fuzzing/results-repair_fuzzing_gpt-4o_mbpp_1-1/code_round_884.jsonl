The function should be able to handle large values of n and return accurate results. Memoization is crucial for optimizing performance and reducing computation time.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement memoization for efficient computation\n- Ensure accurate calculation of nth bell number\n- Optimize function for large values of n\n- Provide clear documentation for user understanding\n- Test function with various n values for reliability\nWe will implement the bell_Number function using memoization to efficiently compute the nth Bell number.
