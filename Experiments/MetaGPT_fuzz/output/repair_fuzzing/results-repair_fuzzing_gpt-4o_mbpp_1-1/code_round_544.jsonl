The function will handle edge cases such as tuples with odd numbers of elements by ignoring the last element. We will use Python's built-in capabilities for efficient tuple handling and dictionary creation. Error handling will be included to provide informative messages for invalid inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'adjacent elements'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, adjacent elements in the tuple are used to form key-value pairs in the dictionary. The first element becomes the key, and the second element becomes the value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
