The function will handle tuples of different lengths by processing only up to the length of the shorter tuple. We will use Python's built-in capabilities for tuple manipulation, ensuring compatibility and performance. The function will include error handling to provide clear messages for invalid inputs, such as non-integer elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'elementwise and tuples'\n    Explanation: This refers to performing a bitwise 'and' operation on corresponding elements of two tuples. The result is a new tuple containing the results of these operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'different lengths': This indicates that the tuples may not be of the same length, and the operation should only consider elements up to the length of the shorter tuple.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples as input.\n    2. Determine the length of the shorter tuple to ensure operations are only performed up to this length.\n    3. Use a loop or list comprehension to iterate over the range of the shorter tuple's length.\n    4. For each index, perform a bitwise 'and' operation on the elements from both tuples.\n    5. Collect the results into a new tuple.\n    6. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    and_tuples((10, 4, 6), (5, 2, 3, 3)) = (0, 0, 2)\n    Explanation: The first tuple is shorter, so only the first three elements are considered. The bitwise 'and' operations are: 10 & 5 = 0, 4 & 2 = 0, 6 & 3 = 2.\n    \n    and_tuples((1, 2, 3), (4, 5)) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: The second tuple is shorter, so only the first two elements are considered. The bitwise 'and' operations are: 1 & 4 = 0, 2 & 5 = 0.\n    \n    and_tuples((), (1, 2, 3)) = ()\n    Explanation: The first tuple is empty, so no operations can be performed, resulting in an empty tuple.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic of iterating up to the length of the shorter tuple inherently handles these cases.\n"], "test": ["def check(and_tuples):\n\tassert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)",
