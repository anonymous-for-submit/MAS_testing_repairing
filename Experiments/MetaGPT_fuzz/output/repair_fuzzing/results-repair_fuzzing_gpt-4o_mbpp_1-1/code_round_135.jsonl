The function will use Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. We will ensure that the function returns both the length of the longest list and the list itself, providing clarity in the output. The function will handle edge cases such as lists with equal lengths by returning the first encountered longest list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum length'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the list with the greatest number of elements within a list of lists.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the list with the largest number of elements compared to others.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This means we are looking for the list with the greatest length among all lists provided.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

The function will use Python's built-in max function with a key argument to efficiently find the longest list. This approach ensures that the function is both simple and efficient, capable of handling large datasets without performance issues.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum length'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the list with the greatest number of elements within a collection of lists.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': means that we need to find the list with the greatest number of elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
