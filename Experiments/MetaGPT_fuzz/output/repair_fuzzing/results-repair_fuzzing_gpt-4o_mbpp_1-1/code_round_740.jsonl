This approach will allow us to handle large inputs by storing intermediate results and avoiding redundant calculations. We will use the SymPy library for its combinatorial functions, which are optimized for performance and can handle large numbers efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'Bell numbers'\n    Explanation: Bell numbers represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the Bell number for a set of size 3 is 5, as there are 5 ways to partition a set of three elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'efficient': The solution should be optimized to handle large inputs without excessive computation time.\n    'large': The function should be able to handle large input values for which Bell numbers need to be calculated.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a table to store Bell numbers up to the required number.\n    2. Set the first Bell number (for a set of size 0) to 1.\n    3. Use a nested loop to fill in the table using the recursive relationship for Bell numbers:\n       - B(n+1) = sum of B(k) * C(n, k) for k = 0 to n, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n    4. Return the Bell number for the given input.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bell_number(0) = 1\n    Explanation: There is exactly one way to partition an empty set, which is to have no subsets.\n    \n    bell_number(1) = 1\n    Explanation: A set with one element can only be partitioned in one way, which is the set itself.\n    \n    bell_number(10) = 115975\n    Explanation: This is a known Bell number for a set of size 10.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic for calculating Bell numbers inherently handles these cases correctly.\n"], "test": ["def check(bell_number):\n\tassert bell_number(2)==2", "def check(bell_number):\n\tassert
