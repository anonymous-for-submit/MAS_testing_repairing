It involves making an initial guess and then refining that guess through a series of iterations until the result is sufficiently accurate.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Validate the input to ensure it is a number.\n    2. Check if the input is zero; if so, return zero as the square root.\n    3. Check if the input is negative; if so, return an error message.\n    4. For positive numbers, make an initial guess for the square root.\n    5. Use the Babylonian method to iteratively refine the guess:\n        - Calculate a new guess using the formula: new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2\n        - Repeat until the difference between the new guess and the old guess is below a certain threshold.\n    6.
