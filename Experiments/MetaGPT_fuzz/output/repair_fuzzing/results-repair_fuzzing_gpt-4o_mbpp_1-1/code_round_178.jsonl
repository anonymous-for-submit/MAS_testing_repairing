For each number, iterate through all previous numbers to check if they can form an increasing subsequence.\n    4. Update the maximum product for the current number based on previous subsequences.\n    5. Use memoization to optimize repeated calculations.\n    6. Return the maximum value from the list of maximum products.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) = 120\n    Explanation: The entire list is an increasing subsequence, and the product is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.\n    \n    max_product([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 5) = 5\n    Explanation: No increasing subsequence longer than one element exists, so the maximum product is just the largest single element, which is 5.\n    \n    max_product([3, 3, 3, 3], 4) = 3\n    Explanation: All elements are equal, so no increasing subsequence longer than one element exists. The maximum product is just one of the elements.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of maintaining a dynamic programming table and checking for increasing subsequences will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence. It must handle edge cases such as arrays with no increasing subsequence or arrays with negative numbers. The function should be optimized for performance given the potential size of input arrays.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to calculate the maximum product of an increasing subsequence\n- Optimize the function for large input arrays\n- Include comprehensive documentation and examples\n- Provide performance analysis and time complexity details\n- Handle edge cases and input validation\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the array to find all possible increasing subsequences and calculate their products. The function will use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum product of an increasing subsequence. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without relying on external libraries, as the task is specific and does not require complex operations that would benefit from libraries like NumPy or SciPy.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'increasing subsequence'\n    Explanation: An increasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers from the array where each number is strictly greater than the previous one.\n\n    'maximum product'\n    Explanation: The maximum product refers to the highest possible product obtained by multiplying the numbers in any increasing subsequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'strictly greater than': This means that each element in the subsequence must be larger than the one before it, not equal or less.\n    Implementation: Use a loop to ensure that each subsequent element is greater than the previous one when forming subsequences.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the largest product possible from all increasing subsequences.\n    Implementation: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum product found so far and update it as larger products are discovered.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a list to store the maximum product for each element as the last element of an increasing subsequence.\n    2. Iterate through the array, for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence.\n    3. If a valid subsequence is found, calculate the product and update the maximum product list.\n    4. Return the largest value from the maximum product list.\n\n# [edge case]\n    max_product([1], 1) = 1\n    Explanation: With only one element, the maximum product is the element itself.\n\n    max_product([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 5) = 5\n    Explanation: No increasing subsequence can be formed, so the maximum product is the largest single element.\n\n    max_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) = 120\n    Explanation: The entire array is an increasing subsequence, and its product is 120.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
