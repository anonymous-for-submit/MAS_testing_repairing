For each tuple, calculate the product of its two elements.\n    4. Take the absolute value of the product.\n    5. Compare this absolute product with the current maximum product and update the maximum if this one is larger.\n    6. After iterating through all tuples, return the maximum product found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_product_tuple([(0, 0), (0, 0)]) = 0\n    Explanation: All products are zero, so the maximum absolute product is zero.\n    \n    max_product_tuple([(-1, -1), (-2, -3)]) = 6\n    Explanation: The absolute products are 1 and 6, respectively. The maximum is 6.\n    \n    max_product_tuple([(1, 0), (0, -1)]) = 0\n    Explanation: The products are 0 and 0, so the maximum absolute product is zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of calculating the absolute product and comparing it to find the maximum will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "test": ["def check(max_product_tuple):\n\tassert
