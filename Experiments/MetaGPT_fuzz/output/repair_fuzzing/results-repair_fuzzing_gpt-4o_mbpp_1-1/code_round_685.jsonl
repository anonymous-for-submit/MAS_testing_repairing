The function will include error handling to ensure that both inputs are numeric, raising a ValueError if non-numeric inputs are provided. This approach ensures compatibility with Python 3.x and maintains efficiency and usability without requiring additional libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'larger'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to determine which of the two values is greater.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'larger': means that we need to compare two values and return the one that is greater.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Define a function named 'maximum' that takes two arguments.\n    2. Implement error handling to check if both inputs are numeric.\n    3.

The original logic of comparing two values will naturally handle these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a simple function that compares two values and returns the larger one.
