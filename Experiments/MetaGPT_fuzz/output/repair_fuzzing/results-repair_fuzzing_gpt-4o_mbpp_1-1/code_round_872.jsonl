The mathematical insight is that a number n can be expressed as a difference of two squares if and only if n is not of the form 4k + 2 for some integer k. This is because n = a^2 - b^2 can be factored as (a-b)(a+b), and for n to be of the form 4k + 2, it would require both factors to be even, which is not possible. We will handle edge cases such as zero and negative numbers appropriately.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'difference of two squares'\n    Explanation: This refers to expressing a number as \\(a^2 - b^2\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers.
