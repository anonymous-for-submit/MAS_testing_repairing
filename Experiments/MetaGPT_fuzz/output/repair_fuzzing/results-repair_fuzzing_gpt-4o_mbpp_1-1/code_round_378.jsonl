The logic using Python's `max` function with a custom key parameter will naturally handle these cases by comparing sums and returning the first occurrence in case of ties.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently determine the sublist with the maximum sum from a collection of sublists. It should handle edge cases such as empty sublists and negative numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to find the sublist with the maximum sum.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty sublists.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Provide documentation and examples for user understanding.\n- Test the function with various types of data inputs.\nWe will implement a function using Python's built-in functions to find the sublist with the maximum sum. This approach is simple and efficient for handling large datasets. We will ensure the function handles edge cases such as empty sublists and sublists with negative numbers by using a default value for comparison.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sublist'\n    Explanation: A sublist is a list that is part of a larger list. In this requirement, we are dealing with a list of lists, and each inner list is considered a sublist.\n\n    'sum of its elements'\n    Explanation: This refers to the total obtained by adding all the numbers in a sublist. The task is to find the sublist with the highest sum.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greatest': This indicates that we need to find the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': In this context, it means the sublist with the highest sum of its elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum sum found so far and another variable to store the corresponding sublist.\n2. Iterate through each sublist in the collection.\n3. Calculate the sum of the current sublist.\n4. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than the maximum sum found so far, update the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist.\n5. After iterating through all sublists, return the sublist with the greatest sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_sum_list([[]]) = []\n    Explanation: The only sublist is empty, so its sum is 0, which is the greatest by default.\n    \n    max_sum_list([[1, 2, 3], [-1, -2, -3], [0, 0, 0]]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The first sublist has the greatest sum (6), compared to -6 and 0 for the other sublists.\n    \n    max_sum_list([[0], [0], [0]]) = [0]\n    Explanation: All sublists have the same sum (0), so any of them can be returned as they are equal.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic will naturally handle cases with empty sublists or sublists with negative numbers by comparing sums directly.\n"], "test": ["def check(max_sum_list):\n\tassert
