This approach will optimize performance for large datasets while maintaining flexibility for mixed data types.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'heap sort'\n    Explanation: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving it to the sorted region.\n\n    'mixed data types'\n    Explanation: The list can contain integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, which require careful handling to ensure correct sorting order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Define a custom comparator function to handle comparisons between integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.\n    - Use Python's heapq library to implement the heap sort algorithm.\n    - Convert the list into a heap using heapq.heapify().\n    - Extract elements from the heap one by one using heapq.heappop() and append them to the result list.\n    - Return the sorted list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    heap_sort([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list should return an empty list as there are no elements to sort.\n    \n    heap_sort([1.1, '2', 3]) = [1.1, 3, '2']\n    Explanation: The list contains mixed data types. The custom comparator should handle these correctly, sorting numbers before strings.\n\n    heap_sort(['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2]) = [1, 2, 'a', 'b', 'c']\n    Explanation: The list contains both strings and integers. Integers should be sorted before strings.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        def custom_comparator(x):\n            if isinstance(x, str):\n                return (1, x)\n            else:\n                return (0, x)\n        \n        def heap_sort(lst):\n            import heapq\n            lst.sort(key=custom_comparator)\n            return lst\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function must handle both numeric and string data types, ensuring that the sorting is stable and efficient.
