This approach will ensure high performance even for large strings. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without any external libraries, as they are sufficient for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'longest palindromic subsequence'\n    Explanation: A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward. The task is to find the longest such subsequence within the given string, which may not necessarily be contiguous.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'longest': This indicates that we need to find the subsequence with the maximum length that satisfies the palindromic property.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'longest': This means we are looking for the subsequence with the greatest length among all possible palindromic subsequences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.\n    2. Set `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`, since a single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n    3. Iterate over the length of substrings from 2 to n (length of the string).\n    4.
