It involves making an initial guess and then refining that guess through a series of iterations until the result is sufficiently accurate.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Validate the input to ensure it is a non-negative number.\n    2. If the input is zero, return zero as the square root.\n    3. Make an initial guess for the square root (e.g., half of the input number).\n    4. Use a loop to iteratively improve the guess:\n        - Calculate a new guess as the average of the current guess and the input number divided by the current guess.\n        - Continue iterating until the difference between consecutive guesses is smaller than a predefined tolerance level.\n    5. Return the final guess as the square root.\n\n# [edge case] \n    babylonian_squareroot(0) = 0\n    Explanation: The square root of zero is zero, so the function should return 0.\n    \n    babylonian_squareroot(-1) = \"Invalid input\"\n    Explanation: Negative numbers do not have real square roots, so the function should return an error message or handle it appropriately.\n    \n    babylonian_squareroot(1e-10) = 1e-05\n    Explanation: Very small positive numbers should be handled accurately by the iterative method, returning a small positive square root.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if number < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot compute square root of a negative number\")\n        elif number == 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code for Babylonian method)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately compute square roots using the Babylonian method, ensuring robustness by handling edge cases such as zero and negative inputs.
