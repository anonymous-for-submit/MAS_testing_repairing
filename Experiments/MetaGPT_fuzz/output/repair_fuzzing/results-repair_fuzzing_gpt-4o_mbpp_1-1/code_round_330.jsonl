Define the function `max_length_list` that takes a list of lists as input.\n2. Use Python's built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `len` to find the list with the maximum length.\n3. Return a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the list itself.\n4. In case of ties (multiple lists with the same maximum length), return the first one encountered.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_length_list([[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) = (3, [4, 5, 6])\n    Explanation: The list [4, 5, 6] has the maximum length of 3.\n    \n    max_length_list([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) = (2, [1, 2])\n    Explanation: All lists have the same length of 2, so the first one is returned.\n\n    max_length_list([[]]) = (0, [])\n    Explanation: The only list is empty, so its length is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of Python's `max` function with a key argument naturally handles ties by returning the first maximum found.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently determine the longest list from a collection, returning both the length and the list itself. It must handle large datasets without performance degradation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle large lists\n- Return both the length and the list\n- Optimize for varying list sizes\n- Ensure accurate results\n- Scalability for future enhancements\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the list of lists to find the one with the maximum length. The function will use Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. We will ensure that the function returns both the length of the longest list and the list itself. The function will be simple and easy to use, focusing on performance and accuracy.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum length'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the list with the greatest number of elements within a list of lists.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': means we need to find the list with the largest number of elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found and another to store the corresponding list.\n    2. Iterate through each list in the list of lists.\n    3. For each list, check its length.\n    4. If the current list's length is greater than the maximum length found so far, update the maximum length and store the current list.\n    5. After iterating through all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_length_list([[]]) = (0, [])\n    Explanation: The only list is empty, so its length is 0.\n    \n    max_length_list([[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]) = (3, [4, 5, 6])\n    Explanation: The list [4, 5, 6] has the maximum length of 3.\n\n    max_length_list([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) = (2, [1, 2])\n    Explanation: All lists have the same length of 2; the function can return any of them.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
