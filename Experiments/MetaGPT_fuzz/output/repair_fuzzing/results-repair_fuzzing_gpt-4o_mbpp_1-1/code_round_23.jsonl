It works by comparing elements with a gap and reducing the gap over iterations until it becomes 1, at which point it functions like a bubble sort. This approach helps in efficiently sorting large datasets by eliminating turtles. We will ensure the function is compatible with Python 3.x and provide clear documentation and examples.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'comb sort'\n    Explanation: Comb sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that improves on bubble sort by using a gap to compare elements, which reduces over time until it becomes 1, at which point it functions like bubble sort.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
