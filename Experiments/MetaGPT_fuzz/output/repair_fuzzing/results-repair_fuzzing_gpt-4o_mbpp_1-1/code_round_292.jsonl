For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2 respectively.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'between two given numbers': This indicates that the function should find all perfect squares that fall within the inclusive range of the two numbers provided as input.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Import the math library to use the sqrt function.\n    2. Define the function perfect_squares with two parameters: start and end.\n    3. Initialize an empty list to store the perfect squares.\n    4. Calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of the start number.\n    5. Calculate the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the end number.\n    6. Iterate from the smallest integer to the largest integer calculated in steps 4 and 5.\n    7. For each integer in this range, calculate its square and add it to the list of perfect squares.\n    8.
