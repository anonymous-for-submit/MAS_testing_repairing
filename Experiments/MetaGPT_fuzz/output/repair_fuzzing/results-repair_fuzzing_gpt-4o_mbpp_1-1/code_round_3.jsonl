We will use Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities to split the input string into words and filter them based on their length. The function will handle large text inputs efficiently by leveraging list comprehensions for concise and fast execution.

In code, this can be implemented using a condition like `len(word) >= 4`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1.
