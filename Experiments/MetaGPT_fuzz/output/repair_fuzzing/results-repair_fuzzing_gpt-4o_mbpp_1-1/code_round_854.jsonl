We will handle edge cases such as negative numbers and zero by ensuring the function only processes non-negative ranges and includes zero as a perfect square. The function will be optimized for performance, especially for large ranges, and will include clear documentation and examples.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'perfect squares'\n    Explanation: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2 respectively.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Import the `math` module to use the `isqrt` function.\n    2. Define the function `perfect_squares(start, end)`.\n    3. Initialize an empty list to store the perfect squares.\n    4. Use a loop to iterate over the range from `math.isqrt(start)` to `math.isqrt(end) + 1`.\n    5. For each integer `i` in this range, calculate `i * i`.\n    6. If `i * i` is within the range `[start, end]`, append it to the list.\n    7. Return the list of perfect squares.\n\n# [edge case] \n    perfect_squares(-5, 5) = [0, 1, 4]\n    Explanation: The range includes negative numbers and zero. The function should handle this by starting from zero and including it as a perfect square.\n    \n    perfect_squares(0, 0) = [0]\n    Explanation: The range is a single number which is zero. Zero is a perfect square (0^2 = 0).\n    \n    perfect_squares(10, 15) = []\n    Explanation: There are no perfect squares between 10 and 15.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if start < 0:\n            start = 0\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently calculate perfect squares between two numbers, including handling edge cases such as negative numbers and zero.
