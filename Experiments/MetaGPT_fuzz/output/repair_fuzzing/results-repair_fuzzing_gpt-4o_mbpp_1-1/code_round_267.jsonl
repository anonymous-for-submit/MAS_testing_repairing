In this requirement, we are dealing with a collection of sublists, and the task is to find the one with the maximum sum of its elements.\n\n    'sum'\n    Explanation: The sum refers to the total obtained by adding all the elements of a sublist. The requirement is to find the sublist with the greatest sum.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greatest': means that we need to find the sublist whose sum of elements is larger than any other sublist in the collection.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': means that we need to find the sublist with the maximum sum compared to other sublists.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
