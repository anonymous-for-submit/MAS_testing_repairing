This involves understanding combinatorial patterns and possibly using dynamic programming for optimal performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to calculate the number of ways to paint the fence\n- Optimize the function for large values of n and k\n- Provide detailed documentation and examples\n- Include edge case handling and validation\n- Create a user-friendly interface for testing the function\nWe will use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of ways to paint the fence. The key idea is to maintain two states: one for the number of ways to paint the fence such that the last two posts have different colors, and another for the number of ways where the last two posts have the same color.
