We will use Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities to split the input string into words and filter them based on their length. The function will handle large text inputs efficiently by leveraging list comprehensions for concise and fast execution. We will also ensure that the function is well-documented with examples to aid understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'words': In the context of this requirement, words are sequences of characters separated by spaces in the input string.\n    'length of at least 4 characters': This means that the words must have a minimum of four characters to be included in the result.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 4 characters': This indicates that the length of the word should be greater than or equal to four. In code, this can be implemented using a condition like `len(word) >= 4`.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Split the input string into individual words using the `split()` method.\n2. Iterate over each word and check if its length is greater than or equal to 4.\n3. Collect all words that meet this condition into a list.\n4.

It should handle lists of varying lengths and types, ensuring that the mapping between elements is consistent.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core function logic to compare patterns\n- Optimize the function for performance with large inputs\n- Write comprehensive tests to cover edge cases\n- Document the function usage with examples\n- Ensure compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. The function will map elements from the first list to the second list and ensure that the mapping is consistent. We will use Python's built-in data structures to achieve this efficiently. The function will handle edge cases such as lists of different lengths by returning False immediately if the lengths differ.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sequence'\n    Explanation: The requirement is about checking if two lists follow the same sequence or pattern. This means that the elements in the first list should map consistently to the elements in the second list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
