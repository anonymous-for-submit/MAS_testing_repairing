It should handle lists of varying sizes, ensuring performance does not degrade with larger inputs. The function should be easy to integrate into existing Python projects.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must efficiently find the smallest missing number.\n- The function should handle large lists without performance issues.\n- The function should be compatible with Python 3.x versions.\n- The function should include comprehensive documentation.\n- The function should be easy to integrate into existing projects.\nWe will implement a function using a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the smallest missing number in a sorted list of natural numbers. This approach ensures that the function can handle large lists without performance degradation. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to maintain compatibility across different Python versions.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'smallest missing number'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the first number that is not present in the sorted list of natural numbers starting from 0.\n\n    'sorted list of natural numbers'\n    Explanation: The list is sorted in ascending order and contains non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrase showing quantity relationship in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': means we need to find the first missing number in the sequence, which is the lowest possible missing number.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Implement a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the smallest missing number.\n    2. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the range of indices in the list.\n    3. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:\n       - Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n       - If the element at `mid` is equal to `mid`, it means all numbers up to `mid` are present, so move `low` to `mid + 1`.\n       - If the element at `mid` is not equal to `mid`, it means the missing number is at or before `mid`, so move `high` to `mid - 1`.\n    4. When the loop ends, `low` will be at the position of the smallest missing number.\n    5. Return `low` as the smallest missing number.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 3], 0, 3) = 4\n    Explanation: All numbers from 0 to 3 are present, so the smallest missing number is 4.\n    \n    find_First_Missing([0, 1, 3, 4], 0, 3) = 2\n    Explanation: The number 2 is missing in the sequence from 0 to 4.\n    \n    find_First_Missing([], 0, -1) = 0\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so the smallest missing number is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The binary search logic inherently handles these scenarios by adjusting the `low` and `high` pointers based on the presence or absence of numbers in their expected positions.\n"], "test": ["def
