Make an initial guess for the square root (e.g., half of the input number).\n    4. Use a loop to iteratively improve the guess using the formula: new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2.\n    5. Continue iterating until the difference between successive guesses is smaller than a predefined tolerance level (e.g., 1e-10).\n    6.
