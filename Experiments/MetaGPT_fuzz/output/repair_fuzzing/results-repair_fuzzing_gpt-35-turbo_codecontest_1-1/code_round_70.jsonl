One approach could be:\n    - Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the sequence.\n    - Iterate through the sequence and identify elements where a_i equals i, incrementing a counter for f(a).\n    - Sort the elements based on their values and indices.\n    - Iterate through the sorted elements and remove elements strategically to maximize f(a).\n    - Return the largest f(a) obtained.\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 1, a = [1]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, there is only one element in the sequence, and it matches its index, so f(a) is maximized.\n\n    n = 5, a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, only the last element matches its index, so f(a) is 1 after removing other elements.\n\n    n = 4, a = [4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Expected output: 2\n    Explanation: In this case, elements at index 1 and 4 match their indices, so f(a) can be maximized by removing elements at index 2 and 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge case)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 70, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 68}
