Iterate through the sequence and for each element:\n        - Remove the element temporarily.\n        - Calculate the count of indices where a_i matches i.\n        - Update the maximum count if the current count is greater.\n    3. Return the maximum count obtained.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Cases:\n    1. n = 1\n       Input: 1\n               1\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: With only one element in the sequence, it will always be at its correct index.\n    \n    2. All elements are at their correct index\n       Input: 4\n               1 2 3 4\n       Output: 4\n       Explanation: All elements are already at their correct indices, so no removal is needed.\n\n    3. No element is at its correct index\n       Input: 3\n               3 2 1\n       Output: 0\n       Explanation: None of the elements are at their correct indices, so removing any element will not increase f(a).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
