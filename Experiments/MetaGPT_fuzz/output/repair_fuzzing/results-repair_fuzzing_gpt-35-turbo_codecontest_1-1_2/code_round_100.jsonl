{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

Calculate the minimum absolute difference by considering all possible combinations of distributing songs between concerts:\n        - If total_duration is even, the minimum absolute difference is 0 (both concerts have equal durations).\n        - If total_duration is odd, the minimum absolute difference can be either 1 or 2.\n            - If a, b, and c are all odd or all even, the minimum absolute difference is 1.\n            - If one of a, b, or c is odd and the others are even, the minimum absolute difference is 2.\n    4. Return the calculated minimum absolute difference.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: t = 1, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: In this case, all songs have different durations, so the optimal distribution results in both concerts having equal durations.\n\n    Case 2: t = 1, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: In this case, the total duration is even, so the minimum absolute difference is 0.\n\n    Case 3: t = 1, a = 3, b = 5, c = 7\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, all durations are odd, so the minimum absolute difference is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic covers all possible scenarios and calculates the minimum absolute difference accordingly.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 100, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert.
