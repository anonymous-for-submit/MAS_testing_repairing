{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The logic provided covers all scenarios.\n", "requirement pool:\n- The main code ...\n- The game algorithm ...\nWe will use Python and focus on creating a simple function to distribute songs into two concerts with minimal possible difference in durations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distribute songs into two concerts': This means that we need to split the songs into two groups in a way that minimizes the difference in total duration between the two groups.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the code logic:\n    1. Calculate the total duration of all songs: total_duration = a + 2*b + 3*c\n    2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum difference, set it to a large value initially.\n    3. Iterate through all possible combinations of distributing songs into two concerts:\n        - Calculate the total duration of concert 1 and concert 2 for each combination.\n        - Update the minimum difference if the absolute difference between the two durations is smaller than the current minimum.\n    4. Return the minimum possible difference found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: t = 1, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, all songs have different durations, so the minimal possible difference is 1 minute.\n    \n    Case 2: t = 1, a = 2, b = 2, c = 2\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: In this case, all songs have the same duration, so they can be evenly distributed between two concerts resulting in 0 difference.\n\n    Case 3: t = 1, a = 3, b = 0, c = 0\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: In this case, there is only one type of song, so all songs will be in one concert resulting in a difference of 3 minutes.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
