{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The logic provided covers all scenarios and ensures the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n", "requirement pool:\n- The main code ...\n- The game algorithm ...\nI will use Python and focus on creating a simple function to distribute songs into two concerts with minimal possible difference in durations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'distribute songs into two concerts with minimal possible difference in durations'\n    Explanation: The core concept is to distribute the songs into two concerts in a way that minimizes the absolute difference in durations between the two concerts.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'small as possible': means that we need to minimize the absolute difference in durations between the two concerts\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Calculate the total duration of all songs: total_duration = a + 2*b + 3*c\n    2. Initialize a variable min_diff with a large value\n    3. Iterate through all possible combinations of distributing songs into two concerts:\n        - Calculate the duration of concert 1 and concert 2 for each combination\n        - Calculate the absolute difference in durations: abs_diff = abs(duration_concert1 - duration_concert2)\n        - Update min_diff if abs_diff is smaller than min_diff\n    4. Return min_diff as the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations\n\n# [edge case] \n    t = 1, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, there is only one of each type of song, so the songs can be evenly distributed between the two concerts resulting in a minimal possible difference of 0 minutes.\n\n    t = 1, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, there are multiple songs of each type. By distributing them optimally, the minimal possible difference in durations between the concerts is 1 minute.\n\n    t = 1, a = 5, b = 0, c = 0\n    Expected output: 5\n    Explanation: In this case, there are only one-minute songs. The total duration is 5 minutes, and since there is only one type of song, the minimal possible difference is equal to the total duration.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge cases)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 59, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert.
