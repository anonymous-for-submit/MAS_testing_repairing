{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The optimal solution is to have one concert with all three songs, resulting in a difference of 0 minutes between the concerts.\n\n    Case 2: t = 1, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: Luntik has different numbers of songs of each duration. The optimal solution is to distribute them such that one concert has songs of total duration 10 and the other has songs of total duration 9, resulting in a difference of 1 minute between the concerts.\n\n    Case 3: t = 1, a = 5, b = 0, c = 0\n    Expected output: 5\n    Explanation: In this case, Luntik only has one-minute songs. The optimal solution is to have one concert with all five songs and the other concert empty, resulting in a difference of 5 minutes between the concerts.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        - Check if all songs are of the same duration, in which case the difference will always be 0.\n        - Consider cases where one type of song dominates (e.g., only one-minute songs), as they may have a unique optimal solution.\n        - Handle cases where the number of test cases or song durations are at their limits.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 42, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert.
