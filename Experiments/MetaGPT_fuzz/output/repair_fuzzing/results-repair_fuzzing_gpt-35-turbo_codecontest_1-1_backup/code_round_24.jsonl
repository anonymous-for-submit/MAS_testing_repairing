It indicates the count of elements in the sequence that are at their correct index.\n\n    'remove elements to maximize f(a)': means that we need to strategically remove elements from the sequence to increase the count of elements at their correct index.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the logic to maximize f(a) by removing elements and concatenating the remaining elements:\n    1. Create a function that takes the initial sequence 'a' as input.\n    2. Initialize a variable 'max_f' to keep track of the maximum f(a) achieved.\n    3. Iterate through the sequence and count the number of elements that are at their correct index.\n    4. If an element is not at its correct index, remove it from the sequence and concatenate the remaining elements.\n    5. Update 'max_f' if the new count of elements at their correct index is greater.\n    6. Repeat this process for all possible removals and concatenations.\n    7. Return the maximum f(a) obtained.\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 1, a = [1]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: In this case, there is only one element in the sequence, and it is at its correct index. Hence, f(a) is maximized.\n\n    n = 5, a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: In this case, all elements are strictly decreasing, and no element can be at its correct index. Hence, f(a) cannot be maximized.\n\n    n = 4, a = [2, 2, 2, 2]\n    Expected output: 4\n    Explanation: In this case, all elements are identical, and each element is at its correct index. By not removing any element, f(a) is maximized.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge cases)\n", "requirement pool:\n- The main code ...\n- The game algorithm ...\nWe will use Python and the itertools library to efficiently solve the problem by generating all possible subsequences of the input sequence and calculating f(a) for each subsequence.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'f(a)': represents the number of indices where a_i = i.
