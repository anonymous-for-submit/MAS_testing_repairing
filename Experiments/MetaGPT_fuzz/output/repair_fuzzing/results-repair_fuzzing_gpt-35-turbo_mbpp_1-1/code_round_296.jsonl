prism.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_Volume(0, 8, 6) = 0\n    Explanation: When the base is 0, the volume of the triangular prism will be 0.\n    find_Volume(10, 0, 6) = 0\n    Explanation: When the height is 0, the volume of the triangular prism will be 0.\n    find_Volume(10, 8, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: When the width is 0, the volume of the triangular prism will be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if base == 0 or height == 0 or width == 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n"], "test": ["def check(find_Volume):\n\tassert
