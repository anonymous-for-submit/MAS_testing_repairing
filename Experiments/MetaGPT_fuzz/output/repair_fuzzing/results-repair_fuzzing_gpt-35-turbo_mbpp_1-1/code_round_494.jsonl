The logic to determine the count of divisors and check if it's even can handle this case.\n", "requirement pool:\n- Implement count_Divisors function to accurately determine if the number of divisors is even\n- Handle edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers gracefully\n- Optimize the algorithm for divisor calculation to improve performance\nWe will design a simple Python function using basic arithmetic operations to determine if the number of divisors is even.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'number of divisors'\n    Explanation: The number of divisors refers to the total count of numbers that can divide the given number without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'even': means that the number of divisors is a multiple of 2\n\n# [code logic]\n    Check if the number is a perfect square, as perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. If it is a perfect square, return \"Odd\"; otherwise, return \"Even\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_Divisors(16) = \"Odd\"\n    Explanation: The number 16 is a perfect square, and perfect squares have an odd number of divisors.\n    count_Divisors(10) = \"Even\"\n    Explanation: The number 10 is not a perfect square, and it has an even number of divisors.\n    count_Divisors(1) = \"Odd\"\n    Explanation: The number 1 is a perfect square, and it has an odd number of divisors.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
