Return the calculated hexagonal number.\n\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    return 2*n**2 - n\n```\n\n# [edge case] \n    hexagonal_num(0) = 0\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the formula results in 0, so the expected output is 0.\n    hexagonal_num(1) = 1\n    Explanation: When n is 1, the formula results in 1, so the expected output is 1.\n    hexagonal_num(10) = 190\n    Explanation: When n is 10, the formula results in 190, so the expected output is 190.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code needed to handle the edge cases. The formula itself covers all possible scenarios.\n"], "test": ["def check(hexagonal_num):\n\tassert hexagonal_num(10) == 190", "def check(hexagonal_num):\n\tassert hexagonal_num(5) == 45", "def
