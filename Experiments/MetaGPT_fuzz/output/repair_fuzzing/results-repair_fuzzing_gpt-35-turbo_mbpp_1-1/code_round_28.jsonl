It should handle edge cases and provide the correct output for valid inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Newman Conway sequence formula correctly\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs\nWe will design a simple Python function using basic mathematical operations to calculate the Newman Conway sequence value at a given position.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n## Prompt 3:\n[requirement]\nWrite a function sequence to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence. The sequence is mathematically defined, using a specific formula, which determines each number in the sequence based on its position. To solve this problem, you'll need to implement the formula correctly.\nsequence(10) == 6\n[plan]\nWe will design a simple Python function using basic mathematical operations to calculate the Newman Conway sequence value at a given position.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'newman conway sequence'\n    Explanation: The Newman Conway sequence is a mathematical sequence where each number is determined based on its position in the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the Newman Conway sequence, we can use a recursive approach to calculate the value at a given position. Here is the logic:\n    - If n is less than or equal to 2, return 1.\n    - Otherwise, return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1)).\n\n# [edge case] \n    sequence(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The first number in the Newman Conway sequence is always 1.\n    \n    sequence(2) = 1\n    Explanation: The second number in the Newman Conway sequence is always 1.\n    \n    sequence(3) = 2\n    Explanation: The third number in the Newman Conway sequence is calculated as sequence(sequence(2)) + sequence(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The recursive logic covers all cases of the Newman Conway sequence calculation.\n"], "test": ["def check(sequence):\n\tassert sequence(10) == 6", "def check(sequence):\n\tassert sequence(2) == 1",
