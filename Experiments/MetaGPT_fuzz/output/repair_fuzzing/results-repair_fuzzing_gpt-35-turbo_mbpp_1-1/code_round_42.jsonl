restrictions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Since the plan suggests using the math library in Python, the implementation could involve utilizing specific functions from the math library to calculate Eulerian numbers efficiently for large values of n and m.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eulerian_num(0, 1) = 1\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the Eulerian number is defined as 1.\n    eulerian_num(3, 0) = 1\n    Explanation: When m is 0, the Eulerian number is defined as 1.\n    eulerian_num(5, 5) = 52\n    Explanation: For n=5 and m=5, the Eulerian number is calculated as 52 based on the formula.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We may need extra code to handle the edge cases where n or m is 0 to ensure the correct calculation of Eulerian numbers.\n        if n == 0 or m == 0:\n            return 1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle
