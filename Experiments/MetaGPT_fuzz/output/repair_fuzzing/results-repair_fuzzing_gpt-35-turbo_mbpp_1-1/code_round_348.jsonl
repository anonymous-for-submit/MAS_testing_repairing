We will optimize the solution by utilizing list comprehension and the sum function for large input values.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'even natural numbers': These are numbers that are divisible by 2 and are greater than 0.\n    'increased to the fifth power': This means raising each even number to the power of 5.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the code, we can follow these steps:\n    - Generate a list of the first n even natural numbers using list comprehension.\n    - Raise each number in the list to the fifth power using list comprehension.\n    - Calculate the sum of the resulting list using the sum function.\n    - Return the total sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_Power_Sum(0) = 0\n    Explanation: When n is 0, there are no even numbers to sum, so the expected output is 0.\n    even_Power_Sum(1) = 32\n    Explanation: The first even number is 2, and 2^5 = 32, so the expected output is 32.\n    even_Power_Sum(2) = 1056\n    Explanation: The first two even numbers are 2 and 4. The sum of their fifth powers is 32 + 1024 = 1056.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers scenarios where n is 0 or 1, and it can handle larger values efficiently.\n"], "test": ["def check(even_Power_Sum):\n\tassert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056", "def
