We will leverage the built-in functions in Python to optimize the performance for large input strings.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'identical string'\n    Explanation: The core concept here refers to a string that remains the same after a certain number of rotations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'least': means finding the minimum number of rotations needed to make the string identical.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Since the plan mentions leveraging built-in functions in Python for optimization, we can consider using the `min` function along with list comprehension to find the minimum number of rotations required. We can rotate the string by slicing it and concatenating it in different ways to check for identical strings.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n    Explanation: The input string \"aaaa\" can be rotated once to get the identical string \"aaaa\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic to find the minimum rotations efficiently should cover cases where the string is already identical after zero rotations.\n", "requirement pool:\n- Efficiently determine the least number of rotations for identical strings\n- Handle edge cases where the string is already identical after zero rotations\n- Ensure correctness and accuracy of rotation calculation\nWe will use the built-in functions in Python to efficiently determine the least number of rotations needed to obtain the identical string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'identical string'\n    Explanation: The core concept here refers to a string that remains the same after a certain number of rotations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than 0': Indicates that the number of rotations needed should be greater than zero.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Since the plan suggests using built-in functions in Python, we can utilize the 'cycle' function from itertools module to efficiently handle rotation and comparison of strings. Here is a possible logic:\n    - Import the 'cycle' function from itertools module\n    - Create a function find_Rotations that takes a string as input\n    - Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of rotations\n    - Use the cycle function to create an iterator for the input string\n    - Iterate through the iterator and compare the joined string with the original string\n    - Increment the counter variable with each iteration\n    - If the joined string matches the original string, return the counter variable as the least number of rotations needed\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") == 1\n    Explanation: In this case, the input string \"aaaa\" requires only 1 rotation to become identical to itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
