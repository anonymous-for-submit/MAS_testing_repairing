Implement extract_singly function to flatten nested lists efficiently\n- Ensure the output set contains all unique numbers from the nested lists\nWe will use the itertools library in Python to efficiently flatten the nested lists and then convert the flattened list into a set to ensure all unique numbers are included.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flatten': The core concept is to convert a nested list into a single-dimensional list by extracting all elements from the nested lists.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to flatten the list of lists into a single set, meaning to extract all elements from the nested lists and create a single collection without any nesting.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using the itertools library in Python to efficiently flatten the nested lists. Here is a detailed logic to implement the code:\n    1. Import the itertools library.\n    2. Define a function extract_singly(lst) that takes a list of lists as input.\n    3. Use itertools.chain.from_iterable() to flatten the nested lists into a single list.\n    4. Convert the flattened list into a set to remove duplicates.\n    5. Return the set containing all unique numbers from the nested lists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)]) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}\n    Explanation: The function should extract all unique numbers from the nested lists and return them as a set. In this case, the output set contains numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
