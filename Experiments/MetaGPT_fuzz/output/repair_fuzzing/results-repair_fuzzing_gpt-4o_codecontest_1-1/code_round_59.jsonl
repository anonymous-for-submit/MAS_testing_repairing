This approach leverages Python's built-in list operations which are optimized for performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'array of integers'\n    Explanation: This refers to a list of integer values that will be manipulated based on the queries provided.\n\n    'queries'\n    Explanation: These are instructions that dictate how the array should be modified. There are two types of queries: adding an element to the array and replacing elements in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least one query of the first type'\n    Explanation: This ensures that there will always be at least one \"1 x\" query, meaning the array will not remain empty.
