{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The key challenge is to accurately determine the flower's height or its demise due to neglect, while efficiently handling multiple test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the flower growth algorithm based on watering patterns.\n- Ensure the program can handle up to 100 test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear output indicating the flower's height or death.\n- Optimize the code for performance with large input sizes.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the growth of a flower based on the given watering pattern over multiple test cases. The function will iterate through each test case, updating the flower's height according to the rules provided. We will use simple list operations to track the watering pattern and calculate the height or determine if the flower dies. The solution will be efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints of 100 test cases with up to 100 days each.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's height changes based on whether it is watered or not. It grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day, by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days, and does not grow if not watered. If not watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n\n    'test cases'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves multiple test cases, each with its own set of days and watering pattern.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two consecutive days': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This can be implemented by checking if there are two consecutive zeros in the watering pattern.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm. This can be implemented by adding 1 to the height for each day with a value of 1 that is not preceded by another 1.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm. This can be implemented by adding 5 to the height for each day with a value of 1 that is preceded by another 1.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n2. Iterate through each day in the test case:\n   - If the current day is watered (a_i = 1):\n     - If the previous day was also watered, increase the height by 5 cm.\n     - Otherwise, increase the height by 1 cm.\n   - If the current day is not watered (a_i = 0):\n     - Check if the previous day was also not watered. If so, set the height to -1 (flower dies) and break out of the loop.\n3. After processing all days, store the final height for the test case.\n4.
