{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

Each ball's path alters the grid state, necessitating efficient handling of state changes and output generation. The solution must accommodate large numbers of balls and grid sizes, ensuring performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement ball movement simulation based on grid directions\n- Optimize for handling up to 100,000 balls efficiently\n- Ensure grid state updates correctly after each ball drop\n- Provide clear output of final column positions\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for input and output\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the directional instructions provided. The function will update the grid state after each ball drop and return the final column positions where each ball exits the grid. We will use efficient data structures to handle up to 100,000 balls and large grid sizes, ensuring performance and accuracy. The solution will be implemented in a single Python file, using basic list operations for grid manipulation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A structured arrangement of cells in rows and columns, where each cell has a specific direction for the ball to move.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, or left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and the direction values dictate how the balls move through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that the starting column for each ball is within the valid range of columns in the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n    Explanation: These phrases define constraints on the input values, ensuring they are within specified limits.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid based on input values.\n    2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n    3. Simulate the movement of the ball through the grid:\n        - If a cell directs right (1), move to the next column.\n        - If a cell directs down (2), move to the next row.\n        - If a cell directs left (3), move to the previous column.\n        - Update the cell's direction to down (2) after a ball leaves it.\n    4. Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    5. Record the exit column for each ball.\n    6.

Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball starting at column c_i:\n   - Set the current position to (0, c_i-1) (adjusting for zero-based indexing).\n   - While the ball is within grid bounds:\n     - Check the direction at the current cell.\n     - Move the ball according to the direction:\n       - If direction is 1, move right and set current cell to 2.\n       - If direction is 2, move down.\n       - If direction is 3, move left and set current cell to 2.\n     - Update the current position based on movement.\n   - Once the ball exits the grid, record the column index (adjusted for one-based indexing).\n3. Return the list of final column positions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: Grid with only one row and one column\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           2\n           1\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 1 and moves down immediately, exiting the grid.\n\n    Edge Case 2: All cells direct balls to move right\n    Input: 3 3 1\n           1 1 1\n           1 1 1\n           1 1 1\n           1\n    Expected Output: 4\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 1 and moves right until it exits the grid from column 4.\n\n    Edge Case 3: All cells direct balls to move left except first column\n    Input: 3 3 1\n           2 3 3\n           2 3 3\n           2 3 3\n           3\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 3 and moves left until it exits the grid from column 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of simulating ball movement through the grid will naturally handle these scenarios by checking grid boundaries and updating positions accordingly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires simulating the movement of balls through a grid based on directional integers. The grid size and number of balls can be large, necessitating efficient algorithms to handle the simulation and output the final column positions quickly.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient ball movement simulation algorithm.\n- Ensure the grid updates correctly after each ball movement.\n- Optimize performance for handling up to 100,000 ball drops.\n- Provide accurate output of final ball positions.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for input and output.\nWe will implement a simulation algorithm that efficiently tracks the movement of balls through the grid based on the directional integers. The grid will be updated after each ball movement, ensuring that subsequent balls follow the updated directions. We will use numpy for efficient grid manipulation and processing.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A structured arrangement of cells in rows and columns where each cell has a specific direction for the ball to move.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, or left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and each cell's direction dictates how the ball moves through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that the column positions for dropping balls are within the valid range of columns in the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n    Explanation: These phrases define constraints on the input values, ensuring they are within acceptable limits for processing.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
