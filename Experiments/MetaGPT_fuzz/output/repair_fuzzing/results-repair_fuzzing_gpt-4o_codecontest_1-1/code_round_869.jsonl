The challenge lies in efficiently computing this for large values of n and k, ensuring the solution is both fast and accurate. The solution must handle up to 300,000 test cases, with n and k up to 100,000, necessitating an optimized approach.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an efficient algorithm to compute f(n, k) for large inputs.\n- Optimize the solution for performance to handle maximum constraints.\n- Ensure the solution is implemented in Python for compatibility.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Document the solution approach and optimization techniques used.\nWe will use a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the function f(n, k). The key idea is to precompute the number of pairs (i, j) such that gcd(i, j) >= l for all possible values of l, i, and j using a sieve-like method. This will allow us to quickly calculate c(l, r) for any given range.
