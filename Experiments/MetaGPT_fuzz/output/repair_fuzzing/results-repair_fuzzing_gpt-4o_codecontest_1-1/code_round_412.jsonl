{"name": "1579_F. Array Stabilization (AND version)", "description": "You are given an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "tags": ["brute force", "graphs", "math", "number theory", "shortest paths"], "difficulty": 12, "id": 1579, "sample_io": [{"input":

In one step, array a is substituted with another array of length n based on these rules: 1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is created as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d positions, and we can describe the elements of this array as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n represents the remainder of dividing i + n - d by n, and it implies the complete array a^{\u2192 d} can be expressed as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$ 2. Following that, every element of the array a_i is substituted by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& acts as a logical \"AND\" operator. For instance, given a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and after the first step, the value of a will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], resulting in [0, 0, 0, 1]. The procedure terminates when the array ceases to change. For any given array a, determine whether it will end up being made solely of zeros at the end of the process. If it will, then calculate the number of steps needed for the process to complete.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.
