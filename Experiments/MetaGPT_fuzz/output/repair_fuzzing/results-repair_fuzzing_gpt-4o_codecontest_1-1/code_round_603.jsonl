{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

Use a greedy approach to pair the most sociable individuals:\n   - While there are at least two people with non-zero sociability, pair them for a talk.\n   - Decrease their sociability by one after each talk.\n   - Record each talk as a pair of indices.\n5. Continue until no more valid pairs can be formed.\n6. Output the total number of talks and the pairs for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test Case 1: \n    Input: 2\n           0 0\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: Both individuals have zero sociability, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test Case 2:\n    Input: 3\n           1 0 1\n    Output: 1\n            1 3\n    Explanation: Only one talk can occur between the two individuals with non-zero sociability.\n\n    Test Case 3:\n    Input: 4\n           0 0 0 0\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: All individuals have zero sociability, so no talks can occur.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic inherently handles cases where no talks can occur due to zero sociability by checking for non-zero values before pairing individuals.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe main requirement is to maximize the number of talks in a meeting by efficiently pairing individuals based on their sociability. The solution must handle large input sizes and provide output in the specified format. The challenge lies in optimizing the pairing process to ensure maximum productivity.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an algorithm to maximize the number of talks based on sociability.\n- Ensure the solution handles up to 200,000 participants efficiently.\n- Provide multiple valid outputs if possible.\n- Optimize the algorithm for speed and efficiency.\n- Include detailed logging for debugging purposes.\nWe will implement a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of talks based on sociability. The approach involves repeatedly pairing the two most sociable individuals until no more talks can be made. This ensures that the maximum number of discussions occur. We will use a priority queue (heap) to efficiently manage and retrieve the most sociable individuals.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can participate in before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and if it is zero, the person leaves immediately.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the number of one-on-one discussions that can occur during the meeting, given the sociability constraints of each participant.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks': This means we need to find the largest number of discussions that can occur given the sociability constraints.\n    Implementation: Use a greedy algorithm to pair the two most sociable individuals repeatedly until no more talks can be made.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive': This means achieving the highest number of talks possible.\n    Implementation: Ensure that the algorithm maximizes the number of discussions by always pairing the most sociable individuals.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to retrieve the number of test cases and sociability parameters for each test case.\n    2. For each test case, use a priority queue (heap) to manage sociability values.\n    3. Continuously pair the two individuals with the highest sociability until no more pairs can be formed.\n    4. Record each pair and decrement their sociability.\n    5. Output the total number of talks and the pairs formed for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero:\n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No talks can occur as all individuals leave immediately.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but there is no one else to pair with.\n\n    Test case with maximum sociability values:\n    Input: 2\n           200000 200000\n    Expected output: 200000\n    Explanation: The two individuals can talk to each other 200000 times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a priority queue will naturally handle these scenarios by not forming pairs when sociability is zero or when there are insufficient participants to form pairs.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 603, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting.
