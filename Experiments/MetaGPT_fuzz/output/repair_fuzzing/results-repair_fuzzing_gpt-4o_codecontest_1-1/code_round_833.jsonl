{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero: \n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No talks can occur as all individuals leave immediately.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but there is no one else to pair with.\n\n    Test case with two people having equal sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           3 3\n    Output: 3\n            1 2\n            1 2\n            1 2\n    Explanation: Both individuals can talk three times with each other.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a max-heap will naturally handle these scenarios by not forming pairs when it's not possible.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on maximizing the number of talks during a meeting by efficiently pairing individuals based on their sociability. The solution must handle multiple test cases and provide clear output for each case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Maximize the number of talks in each meeting.\n- Efficiently pair individuals for conversations.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear and correct output format.\n- Ensure solution scalability for large inputs.\nWe will use a greedy approach to maximize the number of talks. The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available at any given time. This ensures that we are utilizing the maximum possible sociability at each step. We will use a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently retrieve the most sociable individuals. This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can engage in before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and if it is zero, the person leaves immediately.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the number of conversations that can occur during the meeting by pairing individuals with the highest sociability.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks': This means we need to find the largest number of conversations that can occur by optimally pairing individuals based on their sociability.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive': This refers to achieving the highest number of talks possible during the meeting.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) to store individuals based on their sociability.\n    2. For each test case, add all individuals with non-zero sociability to the heap.\n    3. While there are at least two people in the heap:\n        - Extract the two individuals with the highest sociability.\n        - Record a conversation between them.\n        - Decrease their sociability by one and reinsert them into the heap if they still have sociability left.\n    4. Continue until no more conversations can be made.\n    5. Output the total number of conversations and the pairs involved.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all zero sociability: \n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: No conversations can occur as all individuals leave immediately.\n\n    Test case with one person having sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 1\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but there is no one else to pair with.\n\n    Test case with maximum sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           200000 200000\n    Output: 200000\n            (pairs of 1 and 2 repeated 200000 times)\n    Explanation: Both individuals can talk to each other for their maximum sociability.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a priority queue will naturally handle cases where no conversations can be made or when only one person has sociability.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 833, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting.
