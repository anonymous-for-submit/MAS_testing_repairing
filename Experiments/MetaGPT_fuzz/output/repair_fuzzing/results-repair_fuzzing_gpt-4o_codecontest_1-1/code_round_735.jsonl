{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The direction change upon ball exit must be accurately implemented to affect subsequent ball movements. User experience should be engaging, with clear visual feedback and instructions.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient ball movement logic across the grid.\n- Ensure direction change is correctly applied after each ball exits a cell.\n- Provide visual representation of ball paths.\n- Allow grid reset to initial state.\n- Optimize game for different device sizes.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting position, simulate its path through the grid, and update the grid's direction values as the ball exits each cell. The function will efficiently handle large grid sizes by using simple loops and conditionals, ensuring that the direction change is applied correctly after each ball exits a cell.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid'\n    Explanation: A grid is a two-dimensional array of cells, each containing an integer that indicates the direction a ball will travel.\n\n    'direction'\n    Explanation: The direction is determined by the integer value in each cell: 1 for right, 2 for down, and 3 for left.\n\n    'ball'\n    Explanation: A ball is an object that moves through the grid according to the directions specified in each cell it enters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n \u00d7 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates the dimensions of the grid, with n rows and m columns. In code, this can be represented as a two-dimensional list or array with n sublists, each containing m elements.\n\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This specifies that each starting column position for the balls is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this can be checked using a loop or condition to ensure valid input.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the grid dimensions (n, m), number of balls (k), grid directions, and starting columns for each ball.\n2. For each ball, initialize its starting position at the first row and the specified column.\n3. Simulate the ball's movement through the grid:\n   - While the ball is within grid boundaries:\n     - Check the current cell's direction.\n     - Move the ball to the next cell based on the direction.\n     - Change the current cell's direction to 2 (down) after the ball leaves.\n4. Record the column where each ball exits the grid.\n5.
