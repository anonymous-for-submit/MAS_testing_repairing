{"name": "1575_A. Another Sorting Problem", "description": "Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

The function will compare characters at odd indices in ascending order and characters at even indices in descending order. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this efficiently. Given the constraints, the solution will be optimized for performance to handle up to 10^6 characters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'asc-desc-ending'\n    Explanation: This refers to the sorting order where odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending order and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'first position where a and b differ': This indicates the comparison should be made at the first differing character between two strings.\n    Implementation: Use a loop to compare characters at each index until a difference is found.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of books (n) and the length of each title (m).\n    2. Store the book titles in a list.\n    3. Implement a custom sorting function:\n        - For each pair of titles, compare characters at odd indices in ascending order.\n        - Compare characters at even indices in descending order.\n    4. Use Python's sorted function with the custom key to sort the titles.\n    5. Output the indices of the sorted titles.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1\n           A\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one book, it is trivially sorted.\n\n    Input: 2 3\n           ABC\n           BAC\n    Output: 2 1\n    Explanation: At index 0 (odd), 'B' > 'A', so BAC comes before ABC.\n\n    Input: 3 2\n           AB\n           AC\n           AD\n    Output: 3 2 1\n    Explanation: At index 1 (even), 'D' > 'C' > 'B', so AD comes first, followed by AC, then AB.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of comparing odd and even indices will naturally handle these cases.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 473, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.
