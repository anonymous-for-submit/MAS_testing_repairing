{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The grid must update its cell values as balls pass through, changing directions to '2'. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100,000 balls and provide the final column position for each ball after it exits the grid.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement ball movement simulation across the grid.\n- Ensure grid updates cell directions after each ball passes.\n- Optimize performance for handling large numbers of balls.\n- Provide clear output of final column positions.\n- Consider edge cases for small and large grid sizes.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls across the grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path based on the grid's direction values, and update the grid as the ball passes through each cell. We will use a simple loop to handle the ball movements and update the grid efficiently. The function will return the final column positions for each ball. Given the constraints, we will ensure the solution is optimized for performance, especially for handling up to 100,000 balls.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value that dictates the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the ball's movement (right, down, or left).\n    'update': Changing the direction of a cell to 2 after a ball passes through it.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': The grid can have a maximum size of 1000x1000.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball starting at column c_i:\n   - Set the initial position at (0, c_i-1) in the grid.\n   - While the ball is within the grid:\n     - Check the direction of the current cell.\n     - Move the ball according to the direction:\n       - If direction is 1, move right (x, y+1).\n       - If direction is 2, move down (x+1, y).\n       - If direction is 3, move left (x, y-1).\n     - Update the current cell's direction to 2.\n   - Once the ball exits the grid, record its final column position.\n3.
