{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available at any given time. This approach ensures that we are making the most out of each person's sociability. We will use a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently retrieve the two people with the highest sociability. This will allow us to handle large input sizes efficiently. We will also handle edge cases where some participants have zero sociability by simply ignoring them in the pairing process.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can participate in before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and if it is zero, the person leaves immediately.\n\n    'maximize productivity'\n    Explanation: The goal is to arrange the talks such that the total number of conversations is maximized without exceeding any individual's sociability limit.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: This means we need to find the highest number of conversations that can occur without any person exceeding their sociability limit. In code, this involves iterating through possible pairings and ensuring no individual's talk count exceeds their sociability.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive'\n    Explanation: This refers to achieving the highest number of talks possible. In code, this means using a strategy that ensures the maximum utilization of each person's sociability.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the number of people and their sociability values.\n3. Use a max-heap to keep track of the most sociable people.\n4. While there are at least two people with positive sociability:\n   - Extract the two people with the highest sociability.\n   - Record a conversation between them.\n   - Decrease their sociability by one.\n   - If they still have positive sociability, push them back into the heap.\n5. Continue until no more productive talks can be made.\n6. Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all zero sociability: \n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No one can talk as all have zero sociability.\n\n    Test case with one person having high sociability and others zero:\n    Input: 3\n           5 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The person with high sociability cannot talk alone.\n\n    Test case with two people having equal sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           3 3\n    Expected output: 3\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n    Explanation: Both can talk to each other three times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a max-heap naturally handles cases where individuals have zero sociability or when only one person has non-zero sociability by not pairing them for talks.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on maximizing the number of talks while respecting sociability limits.
