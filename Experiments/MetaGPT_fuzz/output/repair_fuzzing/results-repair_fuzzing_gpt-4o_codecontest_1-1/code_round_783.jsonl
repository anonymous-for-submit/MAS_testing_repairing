{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

Each command is represented by one of the letters 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and provokes the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one. It does so strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For instance, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge.

The function will simulate the robot's movements from each possible starting position and track the number of successful commands executed. We will use efficient algorithms to handle large board sizes and command sequences, ensuring the solution is optimized for performance. The function will return the starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed without the robot falling off the board.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'checkered rectangular board'\n    Explanation: The board is a grid with n rows and m columns, where the robot can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'commands'\n    Explanation: The sequence of movements ('L', 'R', 'D', 'U') that the robot executes to navigate the board.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible'\n    Explanation: The goal is to execute the maximum number of commands without the robot falling off the board. This means finding a starting position that allows the longest sequence of movements.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. For each test case, read the dimensions of the board (n, m) and the sequence of commands (s).\n    2.

For each starting position, simulate the robot's movements according to the command sequence.\n    5. Track the number of commands executed successfully before the robot falls off the board.\n    6.

Output the best starting position for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1 1\n    L\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: The board is only 1x1, so any move will cause the robot to fall off immediately. The only starting position is (1, 1).\n\n    2 2\n    U\n    = 2 1\n    Explanation: Starting from (2, 1) or (2, 2), moving 'U' will keep the robot on the board for one move.\n\n    3 3\n    UUUUUUUUUU\n    = 3 1\n    Explanation: Starting from any position in row 3, moving 'U' will allow executing all commands until reaching row 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of simulating movements from each possible starting position inherently handles these cases by checking boundaries before executing each command.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 783, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on.
