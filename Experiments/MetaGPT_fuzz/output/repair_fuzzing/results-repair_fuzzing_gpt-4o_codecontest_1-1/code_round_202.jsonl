{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The key challenge is to accurately calculate the height of the flower while considering edge cases where the flower might die due to consecutive days without watering.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to calculate flower height based on watering patterns.\n- Ensure the program handles edge cases where the flower dies due to lack of watering.\n- Optimize the code for performance given the constraints of up to 100 test cases.\n- Provide clear error messages or outputs when the flower dies.\n- Enhance user experience with detailed explanations of the results.\nWe will implement a function that simulates the growth of a flower based on a sequence of watering days. The function will iterate through each test case, updating the flower's height according to the rules provided. If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, it will be marked as dead. We will use simple list operations and conditionals to achieve this, ensuring the solution is efficient given the constraints. The function will handle edge cases, such as the flower dying on the last day, by checking the sequence of days carefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's height changes based on whether it is watered or not. If watered on consecutive days, it grows more.\n\n    'flower death'\n    Explanation: The flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This means the flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days. In code, this can be checked by iterating through the list and checking if there are two consecutive zeros.\n\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This means if the flower is watered on a single day, its height increases by 1. In code, this can be implemented by adding 1 to the height when a 1 is encountered in the list.\n\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This means if the flower is watered on two consecutive days, its height increases by 5 instead of 1. In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive 1s are encountered and adding 5 to the height.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'shortest possible outcome': This refers to the scenario where the flower dies as soon as possible due to lack of watering. In code, this is represented by returning -1 when two consecutive zeros are found.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the height of the flower to 1.\n2. Iterate through each test case.\n3. For each test case, iterate through the list of watering days.\n4. Check if there are two consecutive zeros; if so, set the height to -1 and break out of the loop.\n5. If a day is watered (1), check if the previous day was also watered:\n   - If yes, increase the height by 5.\n   - If no, increase the height by 1.\n6. After processing all days, store the result for each test case.\n7.

Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm.\n2. Iterate over each day:\n   - If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, set height to -1 and break.\n   - If watered on a single day, increase height by 1 cm.\n   - If watered on consecutive days, increase height by 5 cm.\n3. Return the final height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered at all, but since it's only one day, it doesn't die.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 1 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 1 1 0\n    Expected output: 7\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days consecutively, growing by 5 cm, and then grows by 1 cm on the third day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for checking consecutive days without watering and handles the growth conditions appropriately.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires calculating the height of a flower over a series of days based on watering patterns. The flower grows differently depending on consecutive watering days, and it dies if not watered for two consecutive days. The solution must handle multiple test cases and edge cases where the flower dies.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main logic to calculate flower height based on watering pattern.\n- Ensure the program handles multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the solution for edge cases where the flower dies.\n- Provide clear error messages or outputs when the flower dies.\n- Enhance the user interface for better readability of results.\nWe will implement a function to calculate the height of the flower based on the watering pattern over n days. The function will iterate through the list of days, updating the height according to the rules provided. If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, the function will return -1 indicating the flower has died. We will use simple list operations and conditionals to achieve this, ensuring the solution is efficient and handles edge cases effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth is determined by whether it is watered or not. If watered on consecutive days, it grows more significantly.\n\n    'flower death'\n    Explanation: The flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates a sequence of two consecutive days. In code, this can be checked using a loop to see if two consecutive elements in the list are both 0.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'shortest possible outcome': This refers to the minimum height the flower can achieve, which is when it dies or grows minimally.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the height of the flower to 1 cm.\n2. Iterate through each test case:\n   - For each day, check if the flower is watered (a_i = 1).\n   - If watered on the first day or after a dry day, increase height by 1 cm.\n   - If watered on consecutive days, increase height by 5 cm.\n   - If not watered for two consecutive days, set height to -1 and break out of the loop.\n3. Return the final height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive dry days to die.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 1 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but not on the next two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 1 1 0 1\n    Expected output: 8\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day (consecutive watering), then by 1 cm on the fourth day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
