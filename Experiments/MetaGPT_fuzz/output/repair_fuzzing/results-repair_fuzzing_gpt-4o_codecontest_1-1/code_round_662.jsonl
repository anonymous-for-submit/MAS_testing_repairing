{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The main challenge is to correctly implement the growth and death conditions and ensure the output format is strictly followed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the flower growth logic based on watering conditions.\n- Handle multiple test cases as per the input format.\n- Optimize the solution for performance with maximum input size.\n- Ensure the output format is correct and matches the example.\n- Consider edge cases such as no watering at all or continuous watering.\nWe will implement a function that simulates the growth of a flower over a series of days based on whether it is watered or not. The function will handle multiple test cases and determine if the flower dies or grows to a certain height. We will use simple list operations to track the watering pattern and calculate the flower's height. The function will iterate over each test case, apply the growth rules, and output the result. The solution will be optimized for performance by using efficient list traversal and condition checking.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth is determined by whether it is watered or not, with specific rules for growth increments based on consecutive watering days.\n\n    'flower death'\n    Explanation: The flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This can be implemented by checking if there are two consecutive zeros in the list of watering days.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm. This can be implemented by adding 1 to the height for each day with a value of 1.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on two consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm on the second day. This can be implemented by adding 5 to the height when two consecutive days have a value of 1.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the height of the flower to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n2. Iterate through each test case:\n   - For each day, check if the flower is watered (a_i = 1).\n   - If watered, check if the previous day was also watered:\n     - If yes, increase height by 5 cm.\n     - If no, increase height by 1 cm.\n   - If not watered, check if the previous day was also not watered:\n     - If yes, set height to -1 (flower dies) and break out of the loop.\n3. Output the final height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 1 0\n    Output: 2\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day and not on the second, so it grows by 1 cm and does not die.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 0 0 1\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for the first two days, so it dies before the third day.\n\n    Test case: 4\n    Input: 1 1 0 0\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 6 cm in the first two days but dies after not being watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
