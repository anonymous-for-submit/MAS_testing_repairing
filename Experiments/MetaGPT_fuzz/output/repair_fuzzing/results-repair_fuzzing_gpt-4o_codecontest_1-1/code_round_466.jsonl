{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The algorithm must be optimized to handle up to 100,000 ball drops without performance degradation. User feedback and visual representation are crucial for understanding the ball's path and final position.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient ball movement logic\n- Optimize for large grid sizes and high number of ball drops\n- Provide visual feedback of ball paths\n- Allow grid reset to initial state\n- Enhance user interface for better experience\nWe will implement an efficient algorithm to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given direction values. The algorithm will handle up to 100,000 ball drops by iterating through the grid and updating the direction values as specified. We will use a simple loop to simulate the ball's path and update the grid state accordingly. The solution will be implemented in a single Python file, leveraging basic data structures for optimal performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A matrix-like structure with rows and columns where each cell has a direction value.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, left).\n    Explanation: The grid is a structured layout where balls move according to the direction specified in each cell. The direction values guide the path of the balls through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that the column positions for dropping balls are within the valid range of columns in the grid.\n    Explanation: This ensures that balls are dropped within the bounds of the grid's columns.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n    2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n    3. Use a loop to simulate the ball's movement through the grid:\n        - Check the direction value in the current cell.\n        - Move the ball according to the direction (right, bottom, left).\n        - Update the direction value to 2 if the ball leaves a cell.\n    4. Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    5. Record the final column position for each ball.\n    6.

We will use a simple loop to handle the ball movement and update the grid values as specified. Given the constraints, the algorithm will be optimized to handle up to 100,000 balls efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array representing the game board where balls are dropped.\n    'ball': An object that moves through the grid based on specific rules.\n    'column': A vertical division of the grid where balls are initially dropped and eventually exit.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that each ball is dropped in a column within the range of 1 to m, inclusive.
