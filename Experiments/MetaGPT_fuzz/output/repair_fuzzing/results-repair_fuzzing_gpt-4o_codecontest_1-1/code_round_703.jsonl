{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

This can be implemented by adding 5 to the flower's height when two consecutive days are watered.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n    - Iterate through the list of watering patterns for each test case.\n    - Check if the flower dies due to two consecutive days without water.\n    - If watered on a single day, increase height by 1 cm.\n    - If watered on two consecutive days, increase height by 5 cm.\n    - Return the final height or -1 if the flower dies.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because there are no two consecutive days without water. The height remains 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: [1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but not on the next two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 1] = 8\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the first two days and then grows by 1 cm on the fourth day. Total height is 8 cm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        for each test case:\n            height = 1\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i > 0 and a[i] == 0 and a[i-1] == 0:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n                elif a[i] == 1:\n                    if i > 0 and a[i-1] == 1:\n                        height += 4\n                    else:\n                        height += 1\n            print(height)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, false, true, false, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 703, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
