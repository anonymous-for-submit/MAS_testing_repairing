{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The key challenge is to efficiently update the grid and track the final position of each ball, especially given the constraints on grid size and number of balls. The solution must handle edge cases such as non-linear paths and large input sizes.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core algorithm to simulate ball movement through the grid.\n- Ensure the solution handles maximum input sizes efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm to reduce processing time.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each ball's final position.\n- Consider edge cases and non-linear paths in the grid.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given directional instructions. The function will update the grid as each ball moves, changing the direction of cells to '2' once a ball passes through. We will use a simple loop to process each ball's path and determine its final column position. The algorithm will be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently by minimizing unnecessary operations and using direct indexing for grid updates.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array representing the game board where each cell has a direction for the ball to move.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, down, or left).\n    'update': Changing the direction of a cell to '2' after a ball passes through it.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': The grid can have a maximum size of 1000x1000.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n    '1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3': Each cell's direction is between 1 and 3.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': The starting column for each ball is within the grid's width.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1.

While the ball is within the grid:\n   - Check the direction of the current cell.\n   - Move the ball according to the direction (right, down, or left).\n   - Update the current cell's direction to '2'.\n4.

We will use numpy for efficient grid manipulation and ensure the algorithm handles large grid sizes and high ball counts efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A structured arrangement of cells in rows and columns where each cell has a direction for ball movement.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, or left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and the direction values dictate how the balls move through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the range for grid dimensions, indicating the grid can be as small as 1x1 or as large as 1000x1000.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the number of balls dropped, indicating up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n    Explanation: These phrases define the constraints on grid size and number of balls, which are important for understanding the scale of the problem and ensuring efficient code implementation.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb present in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid using numpy for efficient manipulation.\n    2. For each ball dropped, simulate its movement starting from the specified column in the first row.\n    3. Update the direction of each cell to '2' (bottom) as the ball passes through it.\n    4. Continue moving the ball according to the current cell's direction until it exits the grid.\n    5. Record the column where each ball exits.\n    6.

The original logic of simulating ball movement and updating directions will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game involves a grid-based system where balls are dropped from the top and follow a path determined by the grid's directional values. Each cell's direction can change after a ball passes through, which adds complexity to the pathfinding logic. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100,000 ball drops and grids as large as 1000x1000, ensuring performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main game logic to simulate ball dropping and pathfinding.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for the game.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works well on mobile devices.\n- Add features like difficulty levels and score tracking.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the dropping of balls on a grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path through the grid based on the directional values, and update the grid as the ball passes through. The function will handle large inputs efficiently by using a loop to process each ball sequentially and update the grid in place. We will use basic Python data structures like lists to represent the grid and the ball paths.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value that influences the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, or left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the possible size range for the grid dimensions.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the possible range for the number of balls dropped.\n    '1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3': Specifies the range of direction values in each cell.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
