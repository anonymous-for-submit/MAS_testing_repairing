{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path based on the grid's direction values, and update the grid as the ball moves. The function will efficiently handle large grid sizes and a high number of balls by using simple loops and conditionals.

Return the list of final column positions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: n = 1, m = 1, k = 1, grid = [[2]], c = [1]\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball moves down immediately and exits the grid from column 1.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 5, m = 5, k = 1, grid = [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]], c = [5]\n    Expected Output: 5\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 5 and moves left until it exits from column 5.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 3, m = 3, k = 1, grid = [[1, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3], [2, 2, 2]], c = [1]\n    Expected Output: 3\n    Explanation: The ball moves right across the top row and exits from column 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The challenge is to efficiently simulate the movement of up to 100,000 balls and determine their final positions. The grid's constraints ensure that balls will not move out of bounds in unintended ways.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the grid-based ball movement logic\n- Optimize the algorithm for handling up to 100,000 ball drops\n- Provide a clear output format for the final positions of the balls\n- Ensure the game logic is intuitive and easy to understand\n- Consider visualizing the ball paths for better user engagement\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given directions. The function will efficiently handle up to 100,000 ball drops by iterating through each ball's path until it exits the grid. We will use simple loops and conditionals to determine the ball's movement direction and update the grid accordingly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value indicating the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the ball's movement (right, bottom, or left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Indicates the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Indicates the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid based on the input dimensions and direction values.\n    2. For each ball dropped, start from the specified column in the first row.\n    3. Use a loop to simulate the ball's movement based on the direction value in each cell:\n        - If direction is 1, move right and update the cell to direction 2.\n        - If direction is 2, move down.\n        - If direction is 3, move left and update the cell to direction 2.\n    4. Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    5. Record the column where each ball exits and output these values.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           2\n           1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: The grid is a single cell with direction down, so the ball exits immediately from column 1.\n\n    Input: 3 3 2\n           1 2 3\n           2 2 2\n           3 3 3\n           1 3\n    Output: 2 1\n    Explanation: The first ball moves right then down, exiting at column 2.
