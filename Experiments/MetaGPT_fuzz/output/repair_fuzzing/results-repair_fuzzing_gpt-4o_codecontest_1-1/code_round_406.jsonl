{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns. The algorithm should ensure that it checks all possible paths while avoiding traps and staying within the grid boundaries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine safe paths\n- Ensure the solution handles multiple test cases efficiently\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance\n- Provide clear output for each test case\n- Consider edge cases and validate input constraints\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the start cell to the destination cell. The algorithm will efficiently handle multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and applying the DFS approach to check for a safe path. We will use a simple 2D list to represent the grid and track visited cells to avoid redundant checks.

Performance optimization is crucial to ensure smooth gameplay.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement pathfinding algorithm to determine safe paths\n- Design intuitive UI with clear indicators for safe and trap cells\n- Optimize game performance for quick loading and response\n- Provide retry option for failed levels\n- Include multiple difficulty levels to enhance engagement\nWe will use a simple pathfinding algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore possible paths from the start to the destination. The algorithm will check neighboring cells and avoid traps. Given the constraints, DFS is suitable for this problem as it can efficiently explore paths in a small grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is represented as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell can either be safe ('0') or a trap ('1').\n\n    'neighboring by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp's character can move to any adjacent cell, including diagonally, as long as it stays within the grid boundaries.\n\n    'safe path'\n    Explanation: A path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n) that does not pass through any trap cells ('1').\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid has a fixed number of rows (2) and a variable number of columns (n), which defines the size of the grid.\n    \n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    \n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns in the grid is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two rows of the grid.\n   - Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., DFS) to explore paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n   - Ensure that the path does not pass through any trap cells ('1').\n   - If a safe path is found, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward as all cells are safe.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: There is no continuous safe path from (1, 1) to (2, 4).\n\n    Test case with all traps except start and end:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5\n    01111\n    11110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The only safe cells are the start and end, with no connecting path.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The DFS algorithm inherently checks for valid paths and avoids traps, which covers all edge cases.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 406, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
