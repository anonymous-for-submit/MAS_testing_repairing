{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The primary challenge is ensuring the game can handle up to 100,000 ball drops efficiently, given the constraints on grid size. The game should also provide clear visual feedback to the player, showing the path of each ball and the final exit point.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient grid traversal logic for ball movement\n- Update grid state dynamically as balls move through it\n- Provide visual representation of ball paths\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works on various devices\n- Include a tutorial or help section for new players\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid. The function will update the grid state dynamically as each ball moves through it. We will use a simple loop to process each ball's path, updating the grid directions as specified. The function will handle edge cases where the grid size is very small or very large, ensuring efficient processing even with the maximum number of balls.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A structured arrangement of cells in rows and columns where each cell has a specific direction for ball movement.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and each cell's direction dictates how the ball moves through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'size n \u00d7 m': Specifies the dimensions of the grid.\n    Explanation: The grid has n rows and m columns, which defines the area where balls can move.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates the valid range for column positions where balls are dropped.\n    Explanation: Balls can only be dropped in columns within the range from 1 to m.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid based on input dimensions and directions.\n    2. For each ball dropped:\n        - Start at the specified column in the first row.\n        - Move according to the direction specified in each cell.\n        - Update the direction of each cell to 'bottom' (2) after a ball leaves it.\n        - Continue moving until the ball exits the grid.\n    3. Record the column where each ball exits.\n    4.

Given the constraints, the algorithm will be optimized to handle large grid sizes and a high number of balls efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array representing the game board where each cell has a direction for the ball to move.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, down, or left).\n    'update': Changing the direction of a cell to '2' after a ball passes through it.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n \u00d7 m': Represents the dimensions of the grid, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that each ball is dropped in a column within the range of the grid's width.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the grid with given directions.\n2. For each ball dropped:\n   - Start at the specified column in the first row.\n   - Follow the direction in each cell until the ball exits the grid.\n   - Update each cell's direction to '2' after the ball passes through.\n3. Record the column where each ball exits.\n4. Return the list of exit columns for all balls.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: Grid size is 1x1 with a single ball dropped.\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           2\n           1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball moves down and exits immediately.\n\n    Edge Case 2: All cells initially direct balls to move left, except for the first column.\n    Input: 3 3 2\n           1 3 3\n           2 2 2\n           2 2 2\n           3 3\n    Output: 1 1\n    Explanation: Balls will be redirected to the first column and exit from there.\n\n    Edge Case 3: Large grid with maximum number of balls.\n    Input: 1000 1000 100000\n           (all cells initially set to move right except last column)\n           (all balls dropped in first column)\n    Output: (all balls exit from last column)\n    Explanation: Each ball will traverse to the last column and exit.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of updating cell directions and following paths will naturally handle these scenarios.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, false, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 549, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3).
