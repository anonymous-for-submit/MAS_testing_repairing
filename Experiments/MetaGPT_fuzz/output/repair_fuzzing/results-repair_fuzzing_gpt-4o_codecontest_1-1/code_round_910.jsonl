{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",

Here, it is used to calculate the sum of differences between predicted and re-evaluated ratings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that liked songs should have higher ratings than disliked songs in the re-evaluated list.\n    Implementation: Ensure that for indices i and j, if s_i=1 and s_j=0, then q_i > q_j.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This refers to finding the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between predicted and re-evaluated ratings.\n    Implementation: Sort and assign ratings in a way that minimizes the sum of |p_i - q_i|.\n\n# [code logic]\n1.

Assign ratings from n down to 1 such that liked songs get higher ratings than disliked ones.\n6. Calculate the permutation q and ensure it minimizes the sum of absolute differences.\n7. Output the permutation q for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all songs liked:\n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 111\n    Output: 3 1 2\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, any permutation works, but using p minimizes the sum of absolute differences.\n\n    Test case with all songs disliked:\n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 000\n    Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, any permutation works, but using p minimizes the sum of absolute differences.\n\n    Test case with alternating likes and dislikes:\n    Input: 4, 4 3 2 1, 1010\n    Output: 4 1 3 2\n    Explanation: Liked songs (indices 1 and 3) should have higher ratings than disliked songs (indices 2 and 4).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of sorting liked and disliked indices separately and assigning ratings accordingly will handle these cases efficiently.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to develop a song recommendation module that re-evaluates song ratings based on user feedback.

A 'liked' song should have a higher rating than any 'disliked' song in the final permutation.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than'\n    Explanation: For all i, j such that s_i=1 (liked) and s_j=0 (disliked), q_i > q_j should hold. This means that liked songs must have higher ratings than disliked ones.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest'\n    Explanation: Among all valid permutations, we need to find the one that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the original and new ratings.\n\n# [code logic]\n1.
