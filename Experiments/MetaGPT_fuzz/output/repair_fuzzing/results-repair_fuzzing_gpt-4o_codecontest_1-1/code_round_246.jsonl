{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The DFS/BFS logic inherently handles all possible paths and checks for safety.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if a path exists from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) in a 2-row grid with traps. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns. The key challenge is to navigate around traps while ensuring the path remains within the grid boundaries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance given the constraints.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Consider edge cases such as maximum grid size and complex trap arrangements.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and determine if a path exists from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n). BFS is suitable for this problem as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found if it exists. We will use a queue to manage the exploration of cells and a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid redundant checks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The grid is composed of 2 rows and n columns, where each cell can be either safe ('0') or a trap ('1'). The character starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n).\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Movement is allowed to cells that share a common edge or meet at a single point, meaning the character can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n    'safe cell'\n    Explanation: A cell marked '0' where the character can safely move without dying.\n\n    'trap cell'\n    Explanation: A cell marked '1' where the character dies if he enters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No explicit degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a queue with the starting position (1, 1).\n    2. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to prevent redundant checks.\n    3. While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue the current position.\n        - Check if the current position is the target position (2, n). If yes, return \"YES\".\n        - For each possible move (up, down, left, right, diagonal), calculate the new position.\n        - If the new position is within bounds, not visited, and is a safe cell ('0'), enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n    4. If the queue is exhausted without reaching (2, n), return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Output:\n    YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward as all cells are safe.\n\n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    010\n    000\n    Output:\n    YES\n    Explanation: The trap at (1, 2) can be bypassed by moving directly to (2, 2).\n\n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    011\n    110\n    Output:\n    NO\n    Explanation: The traps block all possible paths to (2, n).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
