{"name": "1606_A. AB Balance", "description": "You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b.\n\nLet \\operatorname{AB}(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in s as a substring. Analogically, \\operatorname{BA}(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in s as a substring.\n\nIn one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s)?\n\nReminder:\n\nThe number of occurrences of string d in s as substring is the number of indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s| - |d| + 1) such that substring s_i s_{i + 1} ... s_{i + |d| - 1} is equal to d. For example, \\operatorname{AB}(aabbbabaa) = 2 since there are two indices i: i = 2 where aabbbabaa and i = 6 where aabbbabaa.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the resulting string s with \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nb\naabbbabaa\nbbbb\nabbaaa\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.\n\nIn the second test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. \n\nIn the third test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.\n\nIn the fourth test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.", "tags": ["strings"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1606, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n", "output":
