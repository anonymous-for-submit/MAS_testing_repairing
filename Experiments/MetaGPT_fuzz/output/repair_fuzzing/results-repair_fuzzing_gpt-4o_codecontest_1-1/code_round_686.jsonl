{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The solution must efficiently handle up to 1000 test cases with potentially large numbers of songs, ensuring that the algorithm is both time and space efficient.\nrequirement pool:\n- Develop an algorithm to minimize the difference in concert durations\n- Ensure the solution can handle large input sizes efficiently\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case\n- Optimize the algorithm for both small and large inputs\n- Document the solution approach and edge cases\nWe will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The idea is to calculate the total duration of all songs and then try to partition them into two subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. This is similar to the 'Partition Problem' which can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that our solution is efficient and can handle large input sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'absolute difference'\n    Explanation: The absolute difference between two numbers is the non-negative difference between them, calculated as |a - b|. In this requirement, it refers to the difference in total durations of the two concerts.\n\n    'partition'\n    Explanation: Partitioning in this context means dividing the songs into two groups (concerts) such that each song is included in exactly one concert.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'one minute', 'two minutes', 'three minutes'\n    Explanation: These phrases indicate the duration of each type of song. In code, these can be represented as constants or variables that denote the duration of each song type.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimal'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the goal is to make the absolute difference between the durations of the two concerts as small as possible. In code, this would involve finding the smallest possible value of |sum1 - sum2|.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Calculate the total duration of all songs.\n2. Use a dynamic programming approach to determine if it's possible to partition the songs into two groups with a specific sum.\n3.
