{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

Once the ball exits the grid, record its final column position.\n5.

The solution must handle a large number of balls and grid sizes efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the grid and ball movement logic.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle up to 100,000 balls efficiently.\n- Develop a user interface that visually represents the grid and ball movements.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works on mobile devices.\n- Add a feature to reset the grid to its initial state.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given directions. The function will efficiently handle up to 100,000 balls using a loop to track each ball's path until it exits the grid. We will use numpy for efficient grid manipulation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid of size n by m'\n    Explanation: This refers to a two-dimensional array with n rows and m columns, where each cell contains a direction for the ball to move.\n\n    'direction in which the ball will head'\n    Explanation: Each cell in the grid has a value (1, 2, or 3) that determines the direction the ball will move: right, down, or left, respectively.\n\n    'release k balls in succession'\n    Explanation: This means that k balls will be dropped one after another, each starting from a specified column in the first row.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the starting column for each ball is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that the column indices are within this range when accessing the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n3. Use a loop to simulate the ball's movement:\n   - Check the current cell's direction.\n   - Update the cell's direction to 2 (down) after the ball leaves.\n   - Move the ball according to the direction (right, down, or left).\n   - Stop when the ball exits the grid.\n4. Record the column where the ball exits.\n5. Return the list of final column positions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: A grid with only one row and one column (n=1, m=1), and k=1 ball starting at column 1.\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball will immediately exit since there's only one cell.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A grid where all cells direct the ball to move right (a_{x,y}=1), and k=1 ball starting at column 1.\n    Expected Output: m\n    Explanation: The ball will move right until it exits from the last column.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A grid where all cells direct the ball to move down (a_{x,y}=2), and k=1 ball starting at any column.\n    Expected Output: The starting column\n    Explanation: The ball will move down and exit from the same column it started.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle these edge cases. The original logic of simulating each ball's path through the grid will naturally handle these scenarios.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 389, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3).
