{"name": "1582_C. Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf", "description": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "tags": ["brute

Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some occurrences of that letter in string s. She has the liberty to erase possibly no occurrences, some occurrences, or even all occurrences of that particular letter.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not. You need to consider all possibilities for the letter choice and find the optimal solution.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome.

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with a total character count of up to 200,000. The algorithm should explore all possible character choices and determine the optimal solution for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to find the minimum deletions for palindrome formation.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm to reduce time complexity.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Document the solution approach and edge case handling.\nWe will iterate over each character in the string and attempt to make the string a palindrome by removing occurrences of that character. For each character, we will use a two-pointer technique to check if the string can be made a palindrome by removing some of its occurrences. We will keep track of the minimum number of deletions required. If no character can be removed to form a palindrome, we will return -1 for that test case. This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints of the problem.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'palindrome'\n    Explanation: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, 'kek' and 'abba' are palindromes.\n\n    'erase some occurrences'\n    Explanation: This means selectively removing instances of a chosen character from the string to potentially form a palindrome.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum number of erased symbols'\n    Explanation: This refers to the smallest count of character removals needed to transform the string into a palindrome. In code, this can be implemented by keeping track of the number of deletions for each character choice and selecting the minimum.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: The least amount of something, in this case, the fewest deletions needed. In code, this is achieved by comparing deletion counts and selecting the smallest.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. For each test case, read the integer n and the string s.\n2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of deletions required, starting with a large value.\n3. Iterate over each unique character in the string s.\n4. For each character, use a two-pointer approach:\n   - Set two pointers at the start and end of the string.\n   - Move the pointers towards each other, skipping over occurrences of the chosen character.\n   - Count how many times you skip the chosen character.\n5. If the remaining string (after potential deletions) is a palindrome, update the minimum deletions if this count is lower.\n6. If no character can be removed to form a palindrome, return -1 for that test case.\n7.
