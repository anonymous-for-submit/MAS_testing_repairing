{"name": "1580_C. Train Maintenance", "description": "Kawasiro Nitori is excellent in engineering. Thus she has been appointed to help maintain trains.\n\nThere are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment. In the beginning, there are no trains, at each of the following m days, one train will be added, or one train will be removed. When a train of model i is added at day t, it works for x_i days (day t inclusive), then it is in maintenance for y_i days, then in work for x_i days again, and so on until it is removed.\n\nIn order to make management easier, Nitori wants you to help her calculate how many trains are in maintenance in each day.\n\nOn a day a train is removed, it is not counted as in maintenance.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i,y_i (1 \u2264 x_i,y_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers op, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, op = 1 or op = 2). If op=1, it means this day's a train of model k is added, otherwise the train of model k is removed. It is guaranteed that when a train of model x is added, there is no train of the same model in the department, and when a train of model x is removed, there is such a train in the department.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines, The i-th of these lines contains one integers, denoting the number of trains in maintenance in the i-th day.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4\n10 15\n12 10\n1 1\n1 3\n1 1\n2 1\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 1\n10000000 100000000\n998244353 1\n2 1\n1 2\n1 5\n2 5\n1 5\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first example:\n\nThe first day: Nitori adds a train of model 3. Only a train of model 3 is running and no train is in maintenance.\n\nThe second day: Nitori adds a train of model 1. A train of model 1 is running and a train of model 3 is in maintenance.\n\nThe third day: Nitori removes a train of model 1. The situation is the same as the first day.\n\nThe fourth day: Nitori removes a train of model 3.

We will use the datetime module to manage the cycles and ensure accurate daily counts.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'train model'\n    Explanation: Refers to the different types of trains, each with its own work and maintenance cycle.\n\n    'work and maintenance cycle'\n    Explanation: Each train model has a specific number of days it works and a specific number of days it is in maintenance, repeating this cycle until removed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at most one train of each model'\n    Explanation: Ensures that there is only one train of each model at any given time, simplifying the management of train states.\n\n    'x_i days', 'y_i days'\n    Explanation: Represents the duration of work and maintenance periods for each train model. In code, these can be implemented using counters or timers to track the current state of each train.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a dictionary to track the state (working or maintenance) and cycle position of each train model.\n    - Initialize a list to record the number of trains in maintenance for each day.\n    - For each operation (add or remove), update the state and cycle position of the relevant train model.\n    - For each day, calculate the number of trains in maintenance based on their current cycle position.\n    - Output the number of trains in maintenance for each day.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           2 1\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: A single train is added and removed on consecutive days, never entering maintenance.\n\n    Input: 2 3\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           1 2\n           2 1\n    Output: 0\n            0\n            0\n    Explanation: Two trains are added but removed before entering maintenance.\n\n    Input: 3 5\n           2 2\n           2 2\n           1 1\n           1 2\n           1 3\n           2 3\n           2 2\n    Output: 0\n            0\n            0\n            0\n            0\n    Explanation: All trains are added and removed before entering maintenance.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic handles adding and removing trains without them entering maintenance.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 945, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i,y_i (1 \u2264 x_i,y_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers op, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, op = 1 or op = 2).
