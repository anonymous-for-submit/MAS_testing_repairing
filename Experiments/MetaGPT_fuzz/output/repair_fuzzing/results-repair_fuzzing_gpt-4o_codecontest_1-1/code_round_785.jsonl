{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The key challenge is to accurately calculate the height and determine if the flower dies due to neglect. The solution must efficiently handle multiple test cases and provide clear output for each scenario.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the flower growth calculation based on watering patterns.\n- Ensure the program handles multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear output indicating the flower's height or death.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance with large input sizes.\n- Enhance user experience with informative error messages.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the flower's growth based on the given watering pattern over n days. The function will iterate through each test case, updating the flower's height according to the rules provided. We will use simple list operations to track consecutive days without watering and adjust the height accordingly. The solution will efficiently handle multiple test cases using loops and conditional statements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's height changes based on whether it is watered or not, with specific rules for consecutive watering days and consecutive non-watering days.\n\n    'consecutive days'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth or death depends on whether it is watered on consecutive days or not watered on consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two consecutive days': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This means checking for two sequential zeros in the input list.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the height increases by 1.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on two consecutive days, the height increases by 5 instead of 1.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n2. Iterate through each day in the test case:\n   - If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, set the height to -1 and break out of the loop.\n   - If the flower is watered on a single day, increase the height by 1.\n   - If the flower is watered on two consecutive days, increase the height by 5.\n3. After processing all days, store the final height for each test case.\n4. Output the results for all test cases.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 0\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive non-watering days to die.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 1 0 0\n    Output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days (days 2 and 3), so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 1 1 0\n    Output: 7\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days (grows by 5 cm) and not watered on the third day (no growth), resulting in a final height of 7 cm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
