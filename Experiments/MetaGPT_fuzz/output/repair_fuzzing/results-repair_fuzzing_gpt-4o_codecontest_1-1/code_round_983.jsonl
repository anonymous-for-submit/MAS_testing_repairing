{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The solution must handle up to 1000x1000 grids and 100,000 ball drops efficiently. The output should clearly indicate the exit column for each ball.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently simulate ball movement through the grid.\n- Update grid cell directions as balls pass through.\n- Handle large grid sizes up to 1000x1000.\n- Output the final column for each ball drop.\n- Provide visual representation of ball paths.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid using a simple loop and update the grid directions as balls pass through. The function will efficiently handle large grid sizes by iterating over the grid and updating the direction in constant time. We will use basic Python data structures such as lists to represent the grid and ball positions.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'matrix of dimensions n \u00d7 m'\n    Explanation: This refers to a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell contains an integer indicating the direction a ball will travel.\n\n    'direction the ball will travel'\n    Explanation: Each integer in the matrix represents a specific direction: 1 for right, 2 for down, and 3 for left.\n\n    'switch to 2'\n    Explanation: When a ball leaves a cell, the direction in that cell changes permanently to 2 (down).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the column positions from which balls are dropped must be within the range of the grid's columns.

For each ball dropped (k times), start at the specified column in the first row.\n3. Simulate the ball's path through the grid:\n   - Use a loop to move the ball according to the direction specified by a_{x,y}.\n   - Update the direction of each cell to 2 once a ball passes through it.\n   - Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n4. Record the column where each ball exits.\n5.

The original logic of simulating each ball's path through the grid and updating directions will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires efficient handling of ball movements across a grid with dynamic direction changes. The solution must account for large grid sizes and multiple ball drops, ensuring performance does not degrade. User input flexibility and clear output of final ball positions are crucial.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle ball movements across a grid with dynamic direction changes.\n- Ensure performance is optimized for large grid sizes up to 1000x1000.\n- Provide clear output of the final column positions for each ball.\n- Allow user input for multiple starting columns for the balls.\n- Visualize the path of each ball for better user understanding.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path through the grid, and update the grid directions as specified. We will use a simple loop to handle the ball movements and update the grid in-place to ensure efficiency. The function will handle edge cases by checking the boundaries of the grid to prevent infinite loops. Given the constraints, we will use basic data structures like lists to represent the grid and the ball paths.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'matrix of dimensions n \u00d7 m'\n    Explanation: This refers to a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell contains a direction for the ball to move.\n\n    'direction the ball will travel'\n    Explanation: Each cell in the matrix has a value (1, 2, or 3) that determines the direction the ball will move: right, down, or left, respectively.\n\n    'switch to 2'\n    Explanation: When a ball leaves a cell, the direction in that cell changes permanently to 2 (downward).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the starting column for each ball is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this means we need to ensure that the column index is within these bounds when accessing the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball starting at column c_i:\n   - Set the current position to (0, c_i - 1) (adjusting for zero-based indexing).\n   - While the ball is within the grid boundaries:\n     - Check the direction of the current cell.\n     - Move the ball according to the direction:\n       - If 1, move right and change direction to 2.\n       - If 2, move down.\n       - If 3, move left and change direction to 2.\n     - Update the grid cell to 2 if it was 1 or 3.\n   - Record the final column position when the ball exits the grid.\n3.
