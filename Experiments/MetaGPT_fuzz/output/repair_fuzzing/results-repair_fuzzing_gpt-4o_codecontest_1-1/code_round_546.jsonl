{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",
