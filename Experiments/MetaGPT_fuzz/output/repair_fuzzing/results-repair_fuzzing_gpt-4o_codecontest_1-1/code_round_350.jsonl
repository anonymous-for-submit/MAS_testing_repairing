{"name": "1579_F. Array Stabilization (AND version)", "description": "You are given an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "tags": ["brute force", "graphs", "math", "number theory", "shortest paths"], "difficulty": 12, "id": 1579, "sample_io": [{"input":

So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "You have an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] consisting solely of zeros and ones, and it's important to note that, unlike other problems, the indices for this array start from zero rather than one. In one step, array a is substituted with another array of length n based on these rules:\n\n1. Initially, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is established as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d positions. We can describe the elements of this array as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n represents the remainder of dividing i + n - d by n. It implies the complete array a^{\u2192 d} can be expressed as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$.\n\n2. Following that, every element of the array a_i is substituted by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& acts as a logical \"AND\" operator.\n\nFor instance, given a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and after the first step, the value of a will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], resulting in [0, 0, 0, 1]. The procedure terminates when the array ceases to change. For any given array a, establish whether it will be composed entirely of zeros at the conclusion of the process, and if it will, then calculate the number of steps needed for the process to complete. Consider edge cases where the array might be empty or already composed entirely of zeros.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.  The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1.

Output the results for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with an already zero array:\n    Input: 1 1\n           0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The array is already composed entirely of zeros, so no steps are needed.\n\n    Test case with a single element:\n    Input: 1 1\n           1\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: A single element cannot be shifted, and it will never become zero through AND operations.\n\n    Test case with maximum shift:\n    Input: 3 3\n           1 0 1\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The shift equals the array length, resulting in no effective change, so it will never become all zeros.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    \n```python\ndef process_test_cases(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, d, a in test_cases:\n        if all(x == 0 for x in a):\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            a_shifted = [a[(i + n - d) % n] for i in range(n)]\n            a = [a[i] & a_shifted[i] for i in range(n)]\n            \n            if all(x == 0 for x in a):\n                results.append(steps)\n                break\n            \n            if steps > n:  # If more than n steps, it will never become all zeros\n                results.append(-1)\n                break\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_cases = [\n    (2, 1, [0, 1]),\n    (3, 2, [0, 1, 0]),\n    (5, 2, [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]),\n    (4, 2, [0, 1, 0, 1]),\n    (1, 1, [0])\n]\n\nprint(process_test_cases(test_cases))\n```\nThis code handles edge cases by checking if the array is already zero at the start and limits iterations to prevent infinite loops.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 350, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset.

Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.
