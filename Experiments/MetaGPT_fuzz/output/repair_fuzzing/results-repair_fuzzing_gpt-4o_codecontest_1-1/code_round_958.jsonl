{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner, with movement possible from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1, but it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The movement rules are simple, allowing adjacent moves, and the game must provide clear feedback on success or failure.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement grid-based movement logic\n- Develop trap detection and feedback system\n- Create a user interface that displays the grid and player position\n- Optimize game performance for quick response\n- Add retry functionality for failed attempts\nWe will implement a function to determine if Monocarp can reach the goal cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) without stepping on any traps. The function will simulate the movement using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible paths. We will use a simple 2D list to represent the grid and track visited cells to avoid revisiting them.

Trap cells ('1') are dangerous and must be avoided, while safe cells ('0') are navigable. Adjacent cells are those directly next to each other, either by side or corner.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '|x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1': This indicates the movement constraint, allowing Monocarp to move to adjacent cells only.\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move to any cell that is directly next to the current cell, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a function to process multiple test cases.\n    - For each test case, read the number of columns and the grid configuration.\n    - Use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n    - Ensure that the path does not include any trap cells ('1').\n    - If a path is found, output 'YES'; otherwise, output 'NO'.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all safe cells:\n    Input: 3\n           000\n           000\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: All cells are safe, so Monocarp can easily reach the destination.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking direct path:\n    Input: 4\n           0111\n           1110\n    Output: NO\n    Explanation: The traps block all possible paths to the destination.\n\n    Test case with alternating safe and trap cells:\n    Input: 6\n           010101\n           101010\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path exists that avoids traps and reaches the destination.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The DFS/BFS logic inherently handles these scenarios by checking for valid paths and avoiding traps.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires a robust pathfinding algorithm to determine if the character can reach the destination without hitting traps. The grid representation must be clear, and the movement rules should be intuitive. Performance optimization is crucial to ensure quick feedback and smooth gameplay.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement pathfinding algorithm to check level completion\n- Ensure grid representation is clear and intuitive\n- Optimize game performance for quick feedback\n- Provide retry option after failure\n- Enhance visual representation of the grid\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if Monocarp can reach the destination cell (2, n) without stepping on traps. The grid will be represented as a 2D list, and we will ensure that the algorithm checks all possible paths while adhering to the movement constraints.
