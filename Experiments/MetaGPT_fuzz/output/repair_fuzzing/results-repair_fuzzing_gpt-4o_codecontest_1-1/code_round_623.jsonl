{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

We will use a simple recursive approach to traverse the grid and check for valid moves.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is structured as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell can either be safe or a trap.\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp's character can move to any of the 8 surrounding cells (including diagonals) as long as they are within the grid boundaries.\n\n    'traps'\n    Explanation: Cells marked with '1' are traps, and stepping on them results in failure.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid is always 2 rows high and n columns wide.\n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two rows of the grid.\n   - Implement a DFS or BFS starting from cell (1, 1).\n   - Use a stack or queue to explore all possible moves from the current cell.\n   - Mark cells as visited to avoid revisiting them.\n   - If cell (2, n) is reached, output \"YES\".\n   - If all possibilities are exhausted without reaching (2, n), output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum grid size:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 3) is possible.\n\n    Test case with all traps except start and end:\n    Input:\n    1\n    3\n    010\n    010\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: There is no valid path from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without stepping on a trap.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) is possible.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The DFS/BFS approach inherently checks all possible paths and will correctly identify if a path exists or not.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 623, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
