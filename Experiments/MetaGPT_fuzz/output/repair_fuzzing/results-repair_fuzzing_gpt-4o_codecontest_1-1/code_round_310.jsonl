{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The challenge is to efficiently compute the final position of each ball after it exits the grid, considering the grid's dynamic nature as balls change the direction of cells they pass through. The solution must handle up to 100,000 balls and grid sizes up to 1000x1000, ensuring no infinite loops occur.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main game logic to determine the final position of each ball.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases and prevents infinite loops.\n- Optimize the algorithm for large input sizes.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each ball's final position.\n- Design a minimalistic and functional UI for the game.\nWe will implement a function that simulates the dropping of balls through a grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path through the grid, and update the grid's direction values as the ball passes through. The function will handle edge cases by ensuring that balls do not enter infinite loops and will efficiently process up to 100,000 balls using a straightforward simulation approach.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value that influences the path of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and the direction values dictate how the balls move through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the maximum dimensions of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n    Explanation: These constraints define the size of the grid and the number of operations, which are important for understanding the scale and performance requirements of the solution.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
