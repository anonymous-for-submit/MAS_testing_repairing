{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The key challenge is to accurately compute the flower's height or determine if it dies, based on the input sequence of days. The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently and provide correct outputs for each scenario.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the growth calculation logic based on watering rules.\n- Support multiple test cases in a single execution.\n- Optimize the solution for performance with maximum input size.\n- Ensure the output format is clear and matches the requirements.\n- Handle edge cases such as no watering at all or continuous watering.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the growth of the flower based on the given rules. The function will iterate over the days, checking the watering pattern and updating the flower's height accordingly. If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, it will be marked as dead. We will use simple list operations to handle the input and output efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The requirement revolves around the growth of a flower based on watering patterns over a series of days.\n\n    'watering pattern'\n    Explanation: The sequence of days on which the flower is watered (represented by 1) or not watered (represented by 0).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This can be implemented by checking for two consecutive zeros in the list.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm. Implemented by adding 1 to the height when a 1 is encountered.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm instead of 1 cm.

If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. If watered on consecutive days, it grows more.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates a sequence of two consecutive days. In code, this can be checked by iterating through the list and checking if two consecutive elements are both 0.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This means that for each day the flower is watered, its height increases by 1 cm. In code, this can be implemented by adding 1 to the height variable when a 1 is encountered in the list.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This means that if the flower is watered on two consecutive days, its height increases by 5 cm on the second day. In code, this can be implemented by checking if both the current and previous day are 1, then adding 5 to the height variable.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n2. Iterate through each day in the test case:\n   - If the current day and the previous day are both watered (1), increase the height by 5 cm.\n   - If only the current day is watered, increase the height by 1 cm.\n   - If two consecutive days are not watered (0), set the height to -1 and break out of the loop.\n3. After processing all days, store the final height for each test case.\n4. Output the results for all test cases.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, so it remains at its initial height of 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: [0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower grows to 6 cm after being watered on two consecutive days but then dies due to two consecutive non-watering days.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for checking consecutive non-watering days and adjusting growth based on watering patterns.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 61, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
