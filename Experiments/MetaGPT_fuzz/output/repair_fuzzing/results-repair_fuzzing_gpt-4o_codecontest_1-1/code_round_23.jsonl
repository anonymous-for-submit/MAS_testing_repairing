{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases, such as maximum grid size and complex trap configurations.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle the upper limits of input constraints.\n- Provide detailed comments and documentation for the code.\n- Consider adding visual representation of the grid for debugging purposes.\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using a simple depth-first search (DFS) approach to determine if Monocarp can navigate from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) without stepping on a trap. Given the constraints of the problem, a DFS is suitable as it can efficiently explore all possible paths in a small grid.

The DFS/BFS logic inherently handles different configurations of traps and safe cells.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on determining the possibility of completing a level in a grid-based game. The key challenge is navigating from the start to the end without hitting traps, ensuring the path is valid and safe.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine level completion\n- Ensure input and output formats are strictly followed\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance across multiple test cases\n- Provide clear feedback to the player on level completion\n- Test the game logic thoroughly to prevent errors\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm to determine if Monocarp can reach the destination without hitting traps. The algorithm will simulate possible moves from the starting point and check if the destination can be reached. We will use a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore the grid, as it is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. This approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible paths while adhering to the constraints of the problem.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is structured as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where Monocarp can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move to any cell that is directly next to or diagonally adjacent to the current cell, as long as it remains within the grid boundaries.\n\n    'trap cell'\n    Explanation: Cells marked with '1' are traps, and Monocarp must avoid these cells to successfully complete the level.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': This defines the grid's dimensions, indicating that there are exactly two rows and a variable number of columns (n).\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a queue for BFS starting from cell (1, 1).\n    2. Use a set to track visited cells to avoid revisiting.\n    3. For each cell, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) within the grid.\n    4. If a move leads to a trap cell ('1'), discard that path.\n    5. If a move reaches cell (2, n), output \"YES\".\n    6. If all possible paths are exhausted without reaching (2, n), output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward with no traps.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking all paths:\n    3\n    010\n    101\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: All paths to (2, n) are blocked by traps.\n\n    Test case with alternating safe and trap cells:\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path can be taken to reach the destination.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
