{"name": "1613_C. Poisoned Dagger", "description": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64
