{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The grid is small, with only two rows, but the number of columns can vary. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with up to 100 columns. The character can move to adjacent cells, including diagonally, but must avoid traps.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles all edge cases, such as maximum grid size and multiple test cases.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle the upper limits of input size.\n- Provide clear output for each test case, indicating success or failure.\n- Consider user interface elements for displaying the grid and path.\nWe will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and determine if Monocarp can reach the destination cell (2, n) without hitting any traps. BFS is suitable for this problem as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found if it exists. We will use a queue to manage the exploration of cells and a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid redundant checks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid', 'adjacent by side and/or corner', 'trap cell'\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2-row by n-column structure where movement is allowed between adjacent cells either by side (sharing a boundary) or corner (meeting at a point).

The function will use a simple pathfinding algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore possible paths while avoiding traps. We will ensure the solution handles multiple test cases efficiently and provides clear output for each case.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is structured as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where Monocarp can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move to any cell that shares a side or a corner with the current cell, allowing diagonal movements.\n\n    'traps'\n    Explanation: Cells marked with '1' are traps, and Monocarp must avoid these to survive and complete the level.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid is defined by having exactly 2 rows and a variable number of columns, n.\n    \n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    \n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns in the grid is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two strings representing the rows of the grid.\n   - Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., DFS) to explore paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n   - Ensure that Monocarp only moves to cells marked '0' (safe cells).\n   - If a path is found, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: With only three columns and no traps, Monocarp can easily reach the destination.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The alternating pattern of traps makes it impossible to reach the destination.\n\n    Test case with a single path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    5\n    00100\n    11011\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: There is a single path through safe cells that allows reaching the destination.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using DFS or similar pathfinding will naturally account for these scenarios by exploring all possible paths and checking for traps.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 684, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
