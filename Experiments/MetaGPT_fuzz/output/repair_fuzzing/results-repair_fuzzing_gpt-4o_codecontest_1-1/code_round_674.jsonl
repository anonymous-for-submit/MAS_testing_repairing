{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The solution must be optimized for large grids and a high number of balls, ensuring that the game remains responsive and accurate in determining the exit column for each ball.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core game logic to handle ball movements and direction changes.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle up to 1000x1000 grid size and 100,000 balls efficiently.\n- Design a user interface that clearly shows the grid and ball paths.\n- Provide detailed instructions and examples for players to understand the game mechanics.\n- Include visual indicators for the direction of ball movement in the grid.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given directions. The function will update the direction of each cell as balls pass through, ensuring efficient handling of large grids and multiple balls.

Initialize a grid using numpy to store the direction values.\n2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n3. Simulate the movement of the ball through the grid:\n   - Check the direction in the current cell.\n   - Move the ball to the next cell based on the direction.\n   - Update the direction of the current cell to 2 (bottom) after the ball departs.\n4. Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n5. Record the column where each ball exits.\n6.

Return the list of final column positions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: A grid with only one row and one column (1x1 grid).\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           2\n           1\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball moves down immediately and exits the grid.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A grid where all cells direct balls to move right until they exit.\n    Input: 1 5 1\n           1 1 1 1 1\n           1\n    Expected Output: 5\n    Explanation: The ball moves right continuously until it exits from the last column.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A grid where all cells direct balls to move left until they exit.\n    Input: 1 5 1\n           3 3 3 3 3\n           5\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball moves left continuously until it exits from the first column.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle these edge cases.

The solution must account for large numbers of balls and grid sizes, ensuring performance remains optimal. User experience should be prioritized with clear visual feedback and intuitive controls.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core game logic to handle ball movements and state changes in the grid.\n- Design a user-friendly interface that visually represents the grid and ball paths.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and accessible on various devices.\n- Provide a tutorial or help section to explain game mechanics.\n- Implement a scoring or progress tracking system for player engagement.\nWe will implement the core game logic using a simple function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid. The function will update the grid state dynamically as each ball passes through, ensuring efficient handling of large inputs. We will use basic Python data structures like lists to represent the grid and ball positions. The function will iterate over each ball's starting position, simulate its path based on the grid's direction values, and update the grid accordingly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value indicating the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the ball's movement (right, bottom, left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Indicates the grid size constraints, meaning the grid can be as small as 1x1 or as large as 1000x1000.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Indicates the number of balls dropped, meaning up to 100,000 balls can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
