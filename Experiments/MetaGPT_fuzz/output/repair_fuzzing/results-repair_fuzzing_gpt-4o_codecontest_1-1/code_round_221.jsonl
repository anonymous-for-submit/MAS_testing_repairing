{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The solution must handle up to 1000 test cases efficiently, with each test case containing large numbers of songs. The algorithm should focus on balancing the total duration of songs between the two concerts.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to distribute songs\n- Ensure the solution handles large inputs efficiently\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance\n- Validate the solution against all test cases\n- Provide clear input and output instructions\nWe will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The idea is to calculate the total duration of all songs and then try to partition them into two subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. This is similar to the 'Partition Problem' which can be solved using a dynamic programming approach.

Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether a sum of `i` minutes can be achieved.\n5. Iterate over each type of song and update the DP array accordingly.\n6. Find the maximum achievable sum `s` that is less than or equal to `target`.\n7. The minimal difference is then `abs(total_duration - 2 * s)`.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: (1, 0, 0) = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, it must go into one concert, resulting in a difference of 1 minute.\n\n    Edge Case 2: (0, 0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: No songs to distribute, so the difference is naturally 0.\n\n    Edge Case 3: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000) = 0\n    Explanation: With equal numbers of each type of song, they can be perfectly balanced between two concerts.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where there are no songs or when all songs are of one type.\n    \n```python\ndef minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        target = total_duration // 2\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for _ in range(a):\n            for j in range(target, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 1:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 1]\n        \n        for _ in range(b):\n            for j in range(target, 1, -1):\n                if j >= 2:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 2]\n        \n        for _ in range(c):\n            for j in range(target, 2, -1):\n                if j >= 3:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 3]\n        \n        max_s = max(i for i in range(target + 1) if dp[i])\n        min_difference = abs(total_duration - 2 * max_s)\n        results.append(min_difference)\n    \n    return results\n```\nThis code handles edge cases by ensuring that the DP array is correctly initialized and updated for each type of song.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 221, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert.
