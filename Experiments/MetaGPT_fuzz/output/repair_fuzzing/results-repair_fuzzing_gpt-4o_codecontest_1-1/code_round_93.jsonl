{"name": "1615_B. And It's Non-Zero", "description": "You are given an array consisting of all integers from [l, r] inclusive. For example, if l = 2 and r = 5, the array would be [2, 3, 4, 5]. What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of the array non-zero?\n\nA bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the description of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 2\n2 8\n4 5\n1 5\n100000 200000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n3\n0\n2\n31072\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array is [1, 2]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0, as 1\\ \\& \\ 2 = 0. However, after deleting 1 (or 2), the array becomes [2] (or [1]), and the bitwise AND becomes 2 (or 1). This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0. However, after deleting 4, 5, and 8, the array becomes [2, 3, 6, 7], and the bitwise AND becomes 2. This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 3.

Consider what is the least quantity of elements you can remove. How can you make the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of the array non-zero?\n\nA bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the description of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.  The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 2\n2 8\n4 5\n1 5\n100000 200000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n3\n0\n2\n31072\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array is [1, 2]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0, as 1\\ \\& \\ 2 = 0. However, after deleting 1 (or 2), the array becomes [2] (or [1]), and the bitwise AND becomes 2 (or 1). This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0. However, after deleting 4, 5, and 8, the array becomes [2, 3, 6, 7], and the bitwise AND becomes 2. This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 3. Note that there may be other ways to delete 3 elements.", "You are given an array consisting of all integers from [l, r] inclusive, so for instance, if l = 2 and r = 5, the array would be [2, 3, 4, 5].
