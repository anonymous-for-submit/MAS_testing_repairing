{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

BFS is suitable for this problem as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists. The grid will be represented as a list of strings, and we will use a queue to manage the cells to be explored. We will also maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting cells.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is represented as a 2-row by n-column grid where each cell can either be safe ('0') or a trap ('1').\n\n    'neighboring by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: The character can move to any adjacent cell, including diagonally, as long as it stays within the grid.\n\n    'hidden dangers'\n    Explanation: Cells marked with '1' are traps, and if the character lands on them, the game ends.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid is always 2 rows high and n columns wide.\n    \n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    \n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns in the grid is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two rows of the grid.\n   - Initialize a queue for BFS starting from cell (1, 1).\n   - Use a set to track visited cells to prevent revisiting.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a cell (x, y).\n     - If the cell is (2, n), output \"YES\" and break.\n     - Check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current cell.\n     - If a move leads to a safe cell ('0') and is within bounds, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching (2, n), output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) is possible.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking direct path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0011\n    1100\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) avoids traps.\n\n    Test case with no possible path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: All paths are blocked by traps.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS approach inherently handles all possible paths and checks for feasibility.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 386, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
