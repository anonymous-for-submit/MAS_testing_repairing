{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The solution must handle up to 1000 test cases and large input values efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to calculate minimal difference\n- Ensure the solution handles large input values efficiently\n- Optimize for speed and accuracy\n- Maintain consistent output format\n- Consider edge cases and test thoroughly\nWe will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to calculate the total duration of all songs and then try to partition them into two subsets such that the difference between their sums is minimized. This is similar to the 'Partition Problem' which can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient and scalable.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'concert': refers to the grouping of songs into two separate events.\n    'absolute difference': means the non-negative difference between the total durations of the two concerts.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'one-minute songs', 'two-minute songs', 'three-minute songs': indicates the duration of each type of song.\n    Explanation: Each song type contributes a specific amount to the total duration of a concert. The goal is to balance these durations between two concerts.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimal': means the smallest possible value for the difference in durations between the two concerts.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to achieve the smallest possible difference in total duration between the two concerts.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Calculate the total duration of all songs.\n    2. Use dynamic programming to find a subset of songs that approximates half of the total duration.\n    3. Calculate the difference between this subset and the remaining songs.\n    4. Return the absolute value of this difference as the minimal possible difference.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: 1 0 0 = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, it must be placed in one concert, resulting in a difference of 1 minute.\n    \n    Case 2: 0 0 0 = 0\n    Explanation: No songs are present, so both concerts have a duration of 0, resulting in a difference of 0 minutes.\n    \n    Case 3: 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 = 0\n    Explanation: With equal numbers of each type of song, they can be perfectly balanced between two concerts, resulting in a difference of 0 minutes.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where no songs are present or when there is only one song.\n        if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:\n            return 0\n        if a + b + c == 1:\n            return max(a, b, c)\n        (other code for dynamic programming approach)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires distributing songs into two concerts such that the absolute difference in their durations is minimized.
