{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

A level is a rectangular grid with two rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1, obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n. Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.

The solution should be efficient to handle up to 100 test cases with grids of size up to 2x100.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement pathfinding algorithm to check possible paths\n- Ensure immediate feedback on trap encounter\n- Optimize performance for handling multiple test cases\n- Provide visual representation of the grid\n- Allow players to retry levels\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to determine if Monocarp can reach the destination without hitting any traps. BFS is suitable for this problem as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found if it exists. We will use a queue to manage the exploration of cells and a set to track visited cells to avoid redundant checks.

We will handle multiple test cases efficiently by iterating through each test case and applying the BFS algorithm. The grid will be represented as a 2D list, and we will use a queue to manage the exploration of cells. The algorithm will check all possible moves from the current cell and ensure that the character does not move into a trap or outside the grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is structured as a grid with two rows and n columns, where Monocarp can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move to any cell that is directly next to or diagonally adjacent to the current cell.\n\n    'trap cell'\n    Explanation: Cells marked with '1' are traps, and Monocarp cannot move into these cells without ending the game.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two rows and n columns': The grid is defined by having exactly two rows and a variable number of columns, n.\n    Explanation: This defines the structure of the grid, which is crucial for understanding the movement constraints.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'least number of moves'\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the shortest path possible to reach the destination cell (2, n) without hitting a trap.\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize a queue for BFS starting from cell (1, 1).\n    - Use a set to track visited cells to avoid revisiting.\n    - For each cell, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n    - Ensure moves do not go outside the grid or into trap cells.\n    - If cell (2, n) is reached, output \"YES\".\n    - If all possibilities are exhausted without reaching (2, n), output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    3\n    010\n    000\n    = YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) safely.\n\n    4\n    0000\n    1110\n    = NO\n    Explanation: The second row is blocked by traps except for the last column, making it impossible to reach (2, n).\n\n    5\n    00000\n    00000\n    = YES\n    Explanation: All cells are safe, allowing Monocarp to reach (2, n) easily.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS algorithm inherently handles these scenarios by checking all possible paths and ensuring safety.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 822, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
