We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'asc-desc-endingly'\n    Explanation: This refers to a custom sorting order where odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending order and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending order.\n\n    'lexicographically'\n    Explanation: Sorting based on the alphabetical order of characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of books (n) and the length of each title (m).\n    2. Read the book titles into a list.\n    3. Define a custom sorting function that:\n       - Iterates through each character of the book titles.\n       - Compares characters at odd positions in ascending order.\n       - Compares characters at even positions in descending order.\n    4. Use Python's sorted function with the custom key to sort the book titles.\n    5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 1 1\n           A\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one book, it remains in its original position.\n\n    Input: 2 3\n           ABC\n           BAC\n    Output: 2 1\n    Explanation: At position 1 (odd), 'B' comes after 'A', so BAC comes before ABC.\n\n    Input: 3 2\n           AB\n           AC\n           AD\n    Output: 3 2 1\n    Explanation: At position 2 (even), 'D' comes before 'C', and 'C' comes before 'B'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The custom sorting logic inherently handles all cases, including edge cases.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 3, "round": 299, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.
