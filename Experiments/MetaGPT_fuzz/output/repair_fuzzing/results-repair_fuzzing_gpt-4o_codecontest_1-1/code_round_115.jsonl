{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The key challenge is to accurately track the growth and determine if the flower dies due to consecutive days without watering. The solution must efficiently handle multiple test cases and provide clear output for each scenario.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the flower growth logic based on watering patterns.\n- Ensure the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear output indicating the flower's height or if it dies.\n- Optimize the code for performance with large input sizes.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\nWe will implement a function that simulates the growth of a flower based on the watering pattern over n days. The function will iterate through each test case, track the flower's height, and determine if it dies due to consecutive days without watering. We will use simple control structures to handle the logic and ensure the program can efficiently process up to 100 test cases. The solution will be implemented in a single Python script without any external libraries, as the problem is straightforward and does not require complex data structures or algorithms.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth is determined by whether it is watered or not. If watered on consecutive days, it grows more.\n\n    'flower death'\n    Explanation: The flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This can be implemented by checking if there are two consecutive zeros in the input list.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If the flower is watered on a single day, it grows by 1 cm. This can be implemented by adding 1 to the height when a 1 is encountered in the list.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If the flower is watered on two consecutive days, it grows by 5 cm instead of 1 cm. This can be implemented by checking if there are two consecutive ones and adding 5 to the height.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of each test case.\n2. Iterate through each day in the test case:\n   - If the flower is watered (a_i = 1), check if the previous day was also watered:\n     - If yes, increase height by 5 cm.\n     - If no, increase height by 1 cm.\n   - If the flower is not watered (a_i = 0), check if the previous day was also not watered:\n     - If yes, set height to -1 (flower dies) and break out of the loop.\n3. After processing all days, store the final height for each test case.\n4. Output the results for all test cases.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower starts at 1 cm and does not die because there is only one day.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower dies because it is not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 1 1\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day because it is watered on consecutive days, starting from an initial height of 1 cm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

It grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day, and by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days. If not watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': The flower grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': The flower grows by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start of the first day.\n    - Iterate through each test case:\n      - For each day in the test case:\n        - If the flower is watered, check if it was also watered the previous day:\n          - If yes, increase height by 5 cm.\n          - If no, increase height by 1 cm.\n        - If the flower is not watered, check if it was also not watered the previous day:\n          - If yes, mark the flower as dead and break out of the loop.\n      - After processing all days, store the final height or -1 if the flower died.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it requires two consecutive days without water to die. The height remains 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: [1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but not on the next two consecutive days, causing it to die.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 1] = 7\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day due to consecutive watering, then grows by 1 cm on the fourth day. It doesn't die because there are no two consecutive days without water.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for consecutive days without watering and adjusts the height accordingly.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 115, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
