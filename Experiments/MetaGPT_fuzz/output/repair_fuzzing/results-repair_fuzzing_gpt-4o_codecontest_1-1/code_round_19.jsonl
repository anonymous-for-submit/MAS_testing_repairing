{"name": "1591_C. Minimize Distance", "description": "A total of n depots are located on a number line. Depot i lies at the point x_i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n\nYou are a salesman with n bags of goods, attempting to deliver one bag to each of the n depots. You and the n bags are initially at the origin 0. You can carry up to k bags at a time. You must collect the required number of goods from the origin, deliver them to the respective depots, and then return to the origin to collect your next batch of goods.\n\nCalculate the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. You do not have to return to the origin after you have delivered all the bags.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 500). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_n (-10^9 \u2264 x_i \u2264 10^9). It is possible that some depots share the same position.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7 4\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n4 2\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n25\n41\n7\n3000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can carry only one bag at a time. Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: 0 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 5, where each 0 means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of 25 units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41. It can be shown that 41 is the optimal distance for this test case.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7

The solution must efficiently handle multiple test cases and large input sizes, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient algorithm for minimum distance calculation\n- Ensure solution handles large number of depots and test cases\n- Optimize code for readability and maintainability\n- Provide clear documentation and examples\n- Consider edge cases and input validation\nWe will implement an efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum distance required to deliver goods to depots on a number line. The algorithm will handle multiple test cases and large input sizes by sorting the depot positions and using a greedy approach to minimize the travel distance. We will utilize Python's built-in sorting and list manipulation capabilities to achieve optimal performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'number line'\n    Explanation: The depots are located on a one-dimensional line, which means their positions can be represented by integers, both positive and negative.\n\n    'carry up to k bags at a time'\n    Explanation: The salesman can only carry a maximum of k bags in one trip from the origin to the depots.\n\n    'minimum distance'\n    Explanation: The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while delivering all bags to the depots.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'up to k bags': This means the salesman can carry a maximum of k bags in one trip. In code, this can be implemented by iterating over the depots in chunks of size k.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This indicates that we need to find the smallest possible total distance. In code, this involves calculating the total distance for each possible delivery sequence and selecting the smallest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read n and k, and then read the positions of the depots.\n3. Separate the depot positions into positive and negative lists.\n4. Sort both lists in descending order of absolute values.\n5. Calculate the total distance by making trips to the farthest depots first, carrying up to k bags per trip.\n6. For each trip, add twice the distance to the farthest depot in that trip (except for the last trip in each direction).\n7. Sum up the distances for all trips and print the result for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. n = 1, k = 1, x = [0] = 0\n    Explanation: The depot is at the origin, so no travel is needed. The expected output is 0.\n\n    2. n = 3, k = 3, x = [-1, 0, 1] = 2\n    Explanation: All depots can be reached in one trip without returning to the origin.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 500). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_n (-10^9 \u2264 x_i \u2264 10^9).

It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.
