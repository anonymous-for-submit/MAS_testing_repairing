{"name": "1579_B. Shifting Sort", "description": "The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2. The segment a[1 \u2026 5] is then selected and is shifted to the left by 3: [\\color{blue}{2, 4, 5, 1, 3}] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}] \n  3. After that the segment a[1 \u2026 2] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{1, 3}, 2, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{3, 1}, 2, 4, 5] \n  4. And in the end the segment a[1 \u2026 3] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{3, 1, 2}, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 2, 3}, 4, 5] ", "tags": ["implementation",

The original logic can handle arrays that are already sorted or have identical elements by checking if the array is sorted before performing any operations.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe task requires sorting an array using cyclic shifts, with constraints on the number of shifts and the format of the output. The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently and provide results in a specified format.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement cyclic shift sorting algorithm\n- Ensure solution handles up to 1000 test cases\n- Optimize for performance within given constraints\n- Provide clear and formatted output\n- Consider edge cases and repeated elements\nWe will implement a function that sorts an array using cyclic shifts. The approach will involve iterating over the array and performing cyclic shifts to move elements into their correct positions. We will use a simple strategy that ensures the number of shifts does not exceed the length of the array. The function will handle multiple test cases efficiently by processing each test case independently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'cyclic shift'\n    Explanation: A cyclic shift involves rotating a segment of an array to the left by a specified offset, effectively rearranging the elements within that segment.\n\n    'segment'\n    Explanation: A segment is a contiguous subarray defined by two indices, l and r, within the array. This segment is the portion of the array that can be cyclically shifted.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'no more than n'\n    Explanation: The number of cyclic shifts performed to sort the array should not exceed the length of the array, n. This means we can perform up to n shifts but not more.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. For each test case, check if the array is already sorted. If it is, return k = 0.\n    2. If not sorted, identify segments that can be cyclically shifted to move elements closer to their correct positions.\n    3. Perform cyclic shifts on identified segments, ensuring the number of shifts does not exceed n.\n    4. Record each shift operation with its parameters (l, r, d).\n    5. Return the number of shifts and their descriptions for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with already sorted array:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no shifts are needed.\n\n    Test case with maximum allowed shifts:\n    Input: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Output: 4\n    Explanation: Each element needs to be shifted to its correct position, requiring n shifts.\n\n    Test case with repeated elements:\n    Input: [2, 2, 1, 1]\n    Output: 2\n    Explanation: Shift segments to group identical elements together and sort them.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of checking if the array is sorted and performing up to n shifts will naturally handle these scenarios.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 500, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array.

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.
