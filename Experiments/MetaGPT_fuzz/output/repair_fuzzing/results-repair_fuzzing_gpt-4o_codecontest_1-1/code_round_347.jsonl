{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

This ensures that the maximum number of talks can occur before any participant reaches their sociability limit. We will use Python's built-in sorting and list manipulation capabilities to efficiently handle the input data.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of discussions a person can have before leaving the meeting. It is represented as a non-negative integer for each person.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to arrange the conversations such that the total number of talks is maximized, considering each person's sociability limit.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to find the arrangement of talks that results in the highest possible count of conversations.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive'\n    Explanation: The meeting is considered most productive when the maximum number of talks occurs, utilizing each person's sociability to its fullest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to retrieve the number of test cases and details for each test case.\n    2. For each test case, sort the participants by their sociability in descending order.\n    3. Pair the most sociable individuals first to maximize the number of talks.\n    4. Keep track of the pairs and decrement their sociability after each talk.\n    5. Continue pairing until no more talks can occur (i.e., all sociability limits are reached).\n    6. Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero:\n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: No talks can occur as all individuals have zero sociability.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but no pair can be formed.\n\n    Test case with maximum sociability values:\n    Input: 2\n           200000 200000\n    Expected Output: A large number of talks, potentially up to 200000.\n    Explanation: Both individuals can talk extensively, forming many pairs.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of sorting and pairing based on sociability will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement focuses on maximizing the number of talks in a meeting by efficiently pairing individuals based on their sociability limits. The solution must handle multiple test cases and large input sizes while providing clear output for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement algorithm to maximize number of talks based on sociability.\n- Ensure solution handles large input sizes efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output format.\n- Optimize pairing strategy for maximum productivity.\n- Consider edge cases where sociability is zero.\nWe will use a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of talks. The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available, as this will ensure that we are utilizing the highest possible sociability at each step. We will use a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently retrieve the most sociable individuals. This approach will handle large input sizes efficiently due to the logarithmic time complexity of heap operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of discussions a person can have before they leave the meeting. A person with a sociability of 0 leaves immediately, while a person with a higher sociability can participate in more discussions.\n\n    'most productive'\n    Explanation: The meeting is considered most productive when the maximum possible number of talks occur. This means pairing individuals in such a way that maximizes the total number of conversations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that we need to find the highest number of conversations that can occur given the sociability constraints. In code, this can be implemented by continuously pairing the two most sociable individuals until no more pairs can be formed.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to achieve the highest possible value for the number of talks. In code, this is achieved by always selecting the two individuals with the highest remaining sociability for each conversation.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to retrieve the number of test cases and the sociability values for each test case.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Use a max-heap to keep track of individuals based on their sociability.\n   - Continuously extract the two individuals with the highest sociability from the heap.\n   - Record a conversation between these two individuals and decrease their sociability.\n   - If either individual's sociability is still greater than zero, push them back into the heap.\n   - Repeat until no more valid pairs can be formed.\n3. Output the total number of conversations and the pairs involved for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test Case 1: \n    Input: 2\n           0 0\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: Both individuals have zero sociability, so no conversations can occur.\n\n    Test Case 2:\n    Input: 3\n           1 1 1\n    Expected Output: 1\n                     1 2\n    Explanation: Each individual can only participate in one conversation, so only one pair can be formed.\n\n    Test Case 3:\n    Input: 4\n           0 0 0 0\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: All individuals have zero sociability, so no conversations can occur.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a max-heap will naturally handle cases where individuals have zero or insufficient sociability to form pairs.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 347, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting.
