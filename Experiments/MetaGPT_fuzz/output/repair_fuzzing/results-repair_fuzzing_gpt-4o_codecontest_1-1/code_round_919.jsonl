{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The solution must efficiently handle up to 1000x1000 grid sizes and 100,000 ball drops, ensuring accurate final column positions for each ball. Edge cases such as minimal and maximal grid sizes must be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently simulate ball movement through the grid\n- Accurately determine final column positions for each ball\n- Handle edge cases for small and large grid sizes\n- Optimize performance for large number of ball drops\n- Provide clear documentation and output format\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the directional instructions provided in each cell. The function will efficiently handle large grid sizes using a loop to track the position of each ball until it exits the grid. We will use basic Python data structures like lists to represent the grid and the ball positions. The algorithm will update the grid as balls move through it, ensuring that each cell's direction changes to '2' after a ball leaves it.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell contains an integer indicating the direction of ball movement.\n    'direction': The integer in each cell that determines the movement of the ball (right, bottom, left).\n    Explanation: The grid is the playing field for the game, and the direction integers guide the path of each ball through the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that the column positions for dropping balls are within the valid range of columns in the grid.\n    Explanation: This ensures that balls are dropped within the bounds of the grid's columns.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
