{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The direction changes dynamically as balls pass through, which adds complexity to the game. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100,000 ball drops, ensuring performance is maintained even with large grid sizes. The user interface should clearly display the grid and ball paths, and the game should be accessible on various devices.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core ball-dropping algorithm with dynamic direction changes.\n- Design a responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.\n- Add visual indicators for ball paths and final positions.\n- Include a reset button to restart the game.\n- Develop a scoring system based on ball paths and final positions.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the ball dropping process on a grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path through the grid, and update the grid's direction values as the ball moves. We will use a simple list of lists to represent the grid and update the direction values in place. The function will handle edge cases such as small or large grid sizes and ensure efficient processing for up to 100,000 ball drops. We will use Python's built-in data structures for simplicity and performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value that influences the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the ball's movement (right, bottom, or left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': Indicates that the starting column for each ball is within the bounds of the grid's width.\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Specifies the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Specifies the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid based on input dimensions and direction values.\n    2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n    3. Simulate the ball's movement based on the current cell's direction:\n        - If direction is 1, move right and update direction to 2.\n        - If direction is 2, move down.\n        - If direction is 3, move left and update direction to 2.\n    4. Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    5. Record the column where each ball exits.\n    6.

The ball movement is determined by these directions, and the grid updates as balls pass through cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that the column positions from which balls are dropped are valid within the grid's width.\n    Implementation: Ensure that the column indices for dropping balls are within the range of the grid's columns.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n    2. Iterate over each ball's starting column.\n    3. For each ball, simulate its movement through the grid:\n        - Start from the first row and the given column.\n        - Follow the direction indicated by the current cell.\n        - Update the direction of the cell to 'down' (2) after the ball leaves it.\n        - Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    4.

The grid's state changes dynamically as balls pass through, necessitating efficient state management. The solution must handle up to 1000x1000 grid sizes and 100,000 ball drops, ensuring performance and scalability.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ball movement algorithm based on grid directions.\n- Ensure the algorithm efficiently handles large grids and many balls.\n- Provide a user interface that clearly displays the grid and ball movements.\n- Include a feature to restart the game and view results.\n- Add visual aids to help players understand ball movements.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through a grid based on directional values. The function will update the grid state dynamically as each ball moves through it. Given the constraints, we will use a simple iterative approach to handle the ball movements efficiently.
