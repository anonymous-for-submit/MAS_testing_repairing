{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The BFS logic inherently handles these scenarios by exploring all possible paths and checking for traps.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if Monocarp can navigate from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) without landing on a trap. The grid is small, with only two rows, but the number of columns can be up to 100. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns. The key challenge is to ensure that the pathfinding logic correctly identifies safe paths while avoiding traps.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles all edge cases, such as grids with maximum columns.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle the upper limits of input size.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Include comments and documentation for maintainability.\nWe will implement a simple pathfinding algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if Monocarp can navigate from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) without landing on a trap. Given the constraints of a 2-row grid, DFS is efficient and straightforward for this problem. We will iterate through each test case, checking possible paths and ensuring the solution handles all edge cases, such as grids with maximum columns.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns'\n    Explanation: The game level is structured as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where Monocarp can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move to any of the 8 surrounding cells (including diagonals) from his current position, as long as they are within the grid.\n\n    'hidden dangers in certain cells'\n    Explanation: Some cells contain traps ('1'), and landing on these cells results in failure.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid is always 2 rows high and n columns wide.\n    Implementation: This defines the structure of the grid, which can be represented as a list of two strings, each of length n.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1.

For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two strings representing the grid.\n   - Use a DFS or BFS approach to explore paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n   - Ensure that moves are only made to safe cells ('0').\n   - If a path is found, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns (n=3) and no traps:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward with no traps.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path can be taken to avoid traps.\n\n    Test case with a trap blocking the path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    3\n    011\n    110\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The path is blocked by traps, making it impossible to reach (2, n).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
