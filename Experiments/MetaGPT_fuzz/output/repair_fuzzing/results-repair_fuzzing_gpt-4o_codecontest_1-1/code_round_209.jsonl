{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The solution should efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with grid sizes up to 2x100. The algorithm must consider all possible paths and ensure that the character does not step on a trap.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if a safe path exists.\n- Ensure the solution handles the maximum constraints efficiently.\n- Provide clear output for each test case.\n- Optimize the code for readability and maintainability.\n- Consider edge cases and validate input constraints.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n). BFS is suitable for this problem as it explores all neighboring nodes level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path without stepping on traps. The grid is small enough (2x100) to handle efficiently with BFS.

Trap cells ('1') are dangerous, while safe cells ('0') are navigable.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a queue for BFS starting from cell (1, 1).\n    2. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting.\n    3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell and check if it is the target cell (2, n).\n    4. If it is the target cell, return \"YES\".\n    5. Otherwise, enqueue all adjacent safe cells that have not been visited.\n    6. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the target cell, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with all safe cells:\n    Input: \n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: All cells are safe, so reaching the target is straightforward.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking direct path:\n    Input: \n    4\n    0110\n    1100\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: Traps block all paths to the target cell.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps and safe cells:\n    Input: \n    5\n    01010\n    10101\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path through alternating safe cells allows reaching the target.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
