{"name": "1579_F. Array Stabilization (AND version)", "description": "You are given an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "tags": ["brute force", "graphs", "math", "number theory", "shortest paths"], "difficulty": 12, "id": 1579, "sample_io": [{"input":

Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "You are given an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only, where the array indexes are numbered from zero. In one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells, and the elements are shifted accordingly as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n.\n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing, so for a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process, find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes, and consider optimizing the solution to handle large arrays efficiently by testing your solution with different inputs to verify its correctness and efficiency. Take edge cases into account, such as arrays that are already full of zeros or have only one element.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

Output the results for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case 1: [0] = 0\n    Explanation: The array is already all zeros, so no steps are needed.\n\n    Test case 2: [1, 0, 0, 0] with d = 1 = -1\n    Explanation: The array will never become all zeros because shifting and AND operations will not change it to all zeros.\n\n    Test case 3: [1, 1, 1, 1] with d = 4 = 1\n    Explanation: A full shift (d = n) results in no change in position, so one AND operation will make it all zeros.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle edge cases where:\n    - The array is already all zeros initially.\n    - The cyclic shift does not change the array (e.g., d = n).\n\n```python\ndef process_test_cases(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, d, a in test_cases:\n        if all(x == 0 for x in a):\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            a_shifted = a[-d:] + a[:-d]\n            new_a = [a[i] & a_shifted[i] for i in range(n)]\n            steps += 1\n            \n            if new_a == a:\n                results.append(-1)\n                break\n            \n            if all(x == 0 for x in new_a):\n                results.append(steps)\n                break\n            \n            a = new_a\n    \n    return results\n```\nThis code handles edge cases by checking if the array is initially all zeros and by breaking out of the loop if no changes occur after an iteration.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on transforming an array through cyclic shifts and logical operations until it stabilizes. The challenge lies in efficiently handling large arrays and ensuring the solution is robust across various test cases, including edge cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement cyclic shift and logical AND operation efficiently.\n- Optimize for large array sizes up to 10^6 elements.\n- Ensure solution correctness across multiple test cases.\n- Handle edge cases like arrays full of zeros or single-element arrays.\n- Provide clear output format as specified in requirements.\nWe will implement a function that performs cyclic shifts and logical AND operations on the array until it stabilizes. The function will handle multiple test cases and efficiently process large arrays by leveraging Python's list slicing capabilities. We will also ensure that the solution handles edge cases such as arrays full of zeros or single-element arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'cyclic shift'\n    Explanation: This refers to the process of moving elements of the array to the right by a specified number of positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the array.\n\n    'logical \"AND\" operator'\n    Explanation: This is a bitwise operation where each element of the array is combined with its corresponding element in the shifted array using the AND operation, resulting in a new array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'only zeros'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to determine if the array will eventually consist entirely of zeros. This means checking if all elements become zero after a series of operations.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'first time'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to find the number of steps required for the array to become all zeros for the first time, not just any time.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the array size and cyclic shift offset.\n3. Initialize a counter for steps.\n4. Perform cyclic shifts and logical AND operations iteratively:\n   - Compute the cyclically shifted array.\n   - Perform element-wise AND operation between the original and shifted arrays.\n   - Check if the resulting array consists only of zeros.\n5. If the array becomes all zeros, record the number of steps; otherwise, return -1 if it stabilizes without becoming all zeros.\n6.
