{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The main challenge is to simulate the movement of each ball through the grid and determine the exit column. The grid's state changes dynamically as balls pass through, which must be accounted for in the simulation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ball dropping algorithm to simulate the path of each ball through the grid.\n- Ensure the grid updates correctly after each ball passes through a cell.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle the maximum constraints efficiently.\n- Develop a user interface that visually represents the grid and ball movement.\n- Add features for different difficulty levels and scoring.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the path of each ball through the grid. The function will update the grid state dynamically as each ball passes through a cell. We will use a simple loop to iterate over each ball's starting position and simulate its movement based on the grid's direction values.

The directions are right (1), down (2), and left (3).\n\n    'drop k balls sequentially'\n    Explanation: Balls are dropped one after another, starting from specified columns in the first row, and their paths are determined by the grid's direction values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the starting column for each ball is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this means we need to ensure that the column indices are within this range when accessing the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball's starting column:\n   - Set the current position to the first row and the specified starting column.\n   - While the ball is within the grid:\n     - Check the direction value at the current position.\n     - Move the ball according to the direction:\n       - If 1, move right and update the current cell's direction to 2.\n       - If 2, move down.\n       - If 3, move left and update the current cell's direction to 2.\n     - Update the current position based on the movement.\n   - Once the ball exits the grid, record its final column position.\n3.

The grid's state changes dynamically as balls pass through, requiring careful state management.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core ball movement logic based on grid directions.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle up to 100,000 ball drops efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface to input grid configurations.\n- Provide clear instructions and feedback on the game's mechanics.\n- Include visualizations of the ball's path for better user understanding.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the direction values.

Output the exit column for each ball.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: A grid with only one row and one column (1x1 grid).\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           1\n           1\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball starts and immediately exits since there's only one cell.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A grid where all cells initially direct balls to move right.\n    Input: 3 3 1\n           1 1 1\n           1 1 1\n           1 1 1\n           1\n    Expected Output: 3\n    Explanation: The ball will move right until it exits from the last column.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A grid where all cells initially direct balls to move left except for the first column.\n    Input: 3 3 1\n           2 3 3\n           2 3 3\n           2 3 3\n           2\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball will move left until it exits from the first column.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle these edge cases. The original logic of moving according to directions and updating cells will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires a grid-based logic where each cell directs the ball's movement. The challenge is to efficiently simulate the ball's path through the grid, updating the grid state as each ball passes through. The solution must handle up to 100,000 balls and a grid size of 1000x1000, ensuring performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core game logic to simulate ball movement through the grid.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle the maximum input size efficiently.\n- Provide a clear and concise output format for the final positions of the balls.\n- Update the grid state dynamically as balls move through it.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the given directions. The function will update the grid state dynamically as each ball moves through it. We will use a simple loop to iterate over each ball's path, updating the direction in each cell to '2' as specified. Given the constraints, the algorithm will be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently by using direct indexing and avoiding unnecessary computations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid': A two-dimensional array where each cell has a direction value indicating the movement of the ball.\n    'direction': The integer value in each cell that determines the ball's movement (right, bottom, left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': Indicates the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': Indicates the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n    '1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3': Indicates the possible direction values in each cell.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
