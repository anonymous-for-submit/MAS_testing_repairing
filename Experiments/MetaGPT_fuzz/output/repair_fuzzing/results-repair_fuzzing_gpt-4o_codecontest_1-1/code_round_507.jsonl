{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1
