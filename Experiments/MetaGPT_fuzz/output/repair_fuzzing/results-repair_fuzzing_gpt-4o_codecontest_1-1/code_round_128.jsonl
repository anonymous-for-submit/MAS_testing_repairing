{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

For each test case, use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the sociability of participants.\n    3. Continuously pair the two most sociable people until no more talks can be made.\n    4. Record each pair of talks and decrement their sociability.\n    5. Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero:\n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No one can talk, so the maximum number of talks is zero.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but they need someone else to converse with, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test case with two people having equal sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           3 3\n    Expected output: 3\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n    Explanation: Both people can talk three times, so they will converse with each other three times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a priority queue will naturally handle these scenarios by ensuring no invalid pairings are made when sociability is zero or insufficient for pairing.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine the optimal pairing of participants in a meeting to maximize the number of talks. Each participant has a sociability limit, and the goal is to ensure that the maximum number of talks occur before any participant reaches their limit. The solution must handle large input sizes efficiently, as the constraints allow for up to 200,000 participants and sociability values.\nrequirement pool:\n- Develop an algorithm to maximize the number of talks.\n- Ensure the solution can handle the maximum input constraints efficiently.\n- Provide flexibility in choosing different valid solutions if multiple exist.\n- Optimize the algorithm for both time and space complexity.\n- Consider edge cases where some participants have zero sociability.\nWe will implement a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of talks. The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available, as this will maximize the number of talks before any participant reaches their sociability limit. We will use a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently retrieve the most sociable participants. This approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently, as the operations on the heap are logarithmic in complexity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can participate in before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and if it is zero, the person leaves immediately.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the number of conversations between pairs of people before any individual reaches their sociability limit.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks': This indicates that we need to find the largest number of conversations that can occur given the sociability constraints.\n    Implementation: Use a greedy approach to always pair the two most sociable people available.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive': This means achieving the highest number of talks possible.\n    Implementation: Continuously pair the two people with the highest remaining sociability until no more pairs can be formed.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to retrieve the number of test cases and sociability data for each test case.\n2. For each test case, use a max-heap to keep track of the sociability of each person.\n3. Continuously extract the two people with the highest sociability from the heap and pair them for a talk.\n4. Decrease their sociability by one and reinsert them into the heap if they can still participate in more talks.\n5. Repeat until no more valid pairs can be formed.\n6. Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero:\n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No talks can occur as all individuals leave immediately.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but there is no one else to pair with.\n\n    Test case with maximum sociability values:\n    Input: 2\n           200000 200000\n    Expected output: 200000\n    Explanation: The two people can talk 200000 times, as they both have maximum sociability.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
