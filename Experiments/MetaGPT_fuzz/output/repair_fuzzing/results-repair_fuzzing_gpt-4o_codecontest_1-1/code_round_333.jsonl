{"name": "1575_I. Illusions of the Desert", "description": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.\n\nThe map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.\n\nThe i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate. To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy. |z| denotes the absolute value of z.\n\nTo prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). \n\n\n\nHelp them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\nIn total, it takes 39 energy.\n\nIn the second query, the illusion rate of the 1-st room changes from 10 to -3.\n\nIn the third query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\n\n\nNow, it takes 32 energy.", "tags": ["data structures", "trees"], "difficulty": 15, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "6 4\n10

The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n, each pair of rooms is connected by several tunnels allowing travel between them, in which the i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate, and to go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, which takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure! Make sure your solution is efficient to handle large inputs.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.
