Libraries such as NumPy can be used for efficient array manipulations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'greatest common divisor (gcd)'\n    Explanation: The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. It is a key concept in number theory and is used to determine the number of integer pairs (i, j) such that gcd(i, j) is greater than or equal to a given value.\n\n    'integer pairs (i, j)'\n    Explanation: This refers to pairs of integers where each pair consists of two numbers i and j, with i being less than or equal to j.\n\n    'dynamic programming'\n    Explanation: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used here to efficiently compute the minimum sum of c(x_i+1, x_{i+1}) over all possible sequences.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'l \u2264 r': This indicates that l is less than or equal to r, which defines the range for the integer pairs (i, j).\n    \n    'l \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 r': This specifies that i and j are within the range from l to r, inclusive.\n    \n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 n': This indicates that k is a positive integer less than or equal to n, defining the constraints for the sequence length.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'greatest': Refers to the largest positive integer that divides both i and j without leaving a remainder in the context of gcd.\n\n    'minimum': Refers to finding the smallest possible sum of c(x_i+1, x_{i+1}) over all valid sequences.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Precompute gcd values for all possible pairs (i, j) within the range [l, r] using efficient algorithms.\n2. Use dynamic programming to calculate f(n, k) by iterating over possible sequences and computing the minimum sum of c(x_i+1, x_{i+1}).\n3. For each test case, read n and k, and apply the precomputed values and dynamic programming approach to find the result.\n\n# [edge case]\n    f(1, 1) = 0\n    Explanation: With n = 1 and k = 1, the only sequence is [0, 1], and c(1, 1) = 0 because there are no pairs (i, j) with i < j.\n\n    f(2, 2) = 1\n    Explanation: With n = 2 and k = 2, the sequence [0, 1, 2] gives c(1, 1) + c(2, 2) = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n    f(10^5, 1) = c(1, 10^5)\n    Explanation: With n = 10^5 and k = 1, we need to compute c(1, 10^5), which involves counting all pairs (i, j) with gcd(i, j) \u2265 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n == k:\n            return sum(c(i+1, i+1) for i in range(n))\n        elif k == 1:\n            return c(1, n)\n        # Additional logic for handling other edge cases based on precomputed values and dynamic programming.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 613, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 f(n, k).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 2\n4 4\n3 1\n10 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n8\n4\n6\n11\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, YouKn0wWho can select the sequence [0, 2, 6].
