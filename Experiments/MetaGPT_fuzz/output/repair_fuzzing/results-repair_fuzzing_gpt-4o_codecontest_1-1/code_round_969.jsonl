The function will compare characters at odd indices in ascending order and characters at even indices in descending order. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this efficiently. Given the constraints, the solution will be optimized to handle up to 10^6 characters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'asc-desc-ending'\n    Explanation: This refers to the sorting order where odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending order and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending order.\n\n    'lexicographically'\n    Explanation: Sorting based on the alphabetical order of characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of books (n) and the length of each title (m).\n    2. Read the book titles into a list.\n    3. Implement a custom sorting function:\n        - For each book title, create a tuple where odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending order and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending order.\n        - Use this tuple as the key for sorting.\n    4. Sort the list of book titles using the custom key.\n    5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 1 1\n           A\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one book, it is trivially sorted.\n\n    Input: 2 2\n           AB\n           BA\n    Output: 2 1\n    Explanation: For odd positions, 'A' comes before 'B', and for even positions, 'B' comes before 'A'.\n\n    Input: 3 3\n           ABC\n           BAC\n           CAB\n    Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: The first character determines the order since all books differ at the first position.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of sorting using a custom key function will handle all cases, including edge cases.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 969, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.
