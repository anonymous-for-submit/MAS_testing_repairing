{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

Each ball's path is influenced by the change in direction of cells it passes through. The solution must efficiently compute the final column for each ball, especially for large grid sizes and numerous balls. Edge cases such as small grids and non-linear paths due to cell updates must be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement ball movement logic based on grid directions\n- Optimize for large grid sizes and high number of balls\n- Ensure accurate updates of cell directions after ball passes\n- Provide clear output of final column positions\n- Consider edge cases and non-linear paths\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the directional integers. The function will update the grid as each ball passes through, changing the direction of the cells. We will use efficient data structures to handle large grid sizes and a high number of balls, ensuring the solution is optimized for performance. The function will return the final column positions for each ball after it exits the grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid', 'direction', 'ball movement'\n    Explanation: The grid is a matrix where each cell has a direction integer that dictates the movement of the ball. The ball movement is determined by the integer in the cell it currently occupies, and the direction changes as the ball leaves the cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'size n \u00d7 m': indicates the dimensions of the grid, which are important for understanding the boundaries within which the balls move.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': indicates the valid range for the column positions from which balls are dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n    2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n    3.

The direction values (1, 2, 3) correspond to right, down, and left movements respectively. The ball movement is determined by these direction values and changes the grid as it moves.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that the column positions from which balls are dropped are within the valid range of columns in the grid.\n    Implementation: Ensure that the column indices for dropping balls are within the bounds of the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid based on input values.\n    2. For each ball dropped:\n        - Start at the specified column in the first row.\n        - Follow the direction specified by the current cell.\n        - Update the direction of the cell to 'down' (2) after the ball leaves it.\n        - Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n    3. Record the column where each ball exits.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Dropping balls in a single row grid: \n    Input: 1 5 3\n           1 2 3 3 3\n           1 2 1\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The balls will move according to their initial directions and exit immediately since there's only one row.\n\n    Dropping balls in a single column grid:\n    Input: 5 1 3\n           2\n           2\n           2\n           2\n           2\n           1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: All balls will move straight down and exit from column 1.\n\n    Large grid with complex paths:\n    Input: 1000 1000 1\n           (grid with mixed directions)\n           (random column)\n    Output: (depends on grid configuration)\n    Explanation: This tests performance and correctness on large grids with potentially complex paths.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of simulating ball movement through the grid will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires a simulation of ball movements through a grid based on directional integers. Each ball's path is influenced by the grid's current state, which changes as balls pass through cells. The solution must efficiently handle large grid sizes and numerous balls, ensuring accurate final column determination for each ball.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement ball movement logic based on grid directions.\n- Update grid state after each ball movement.\n- Optimize for large grid sizes and high ball counts.\n- Ensure output format matches requirements.\n- Provide visual representation of ball paths.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls through the grid based on the directional integers. The function will update the grid state after each ball movement and determine the final column where each ball exits the grid. We will use numpy for efficient grid manipulation, which is suitable for handling large grid sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid', 'direction', 'ball movement'\n    Explanation: The grid is a matrix of size n x m where each cell contains a direction (1, 2, or 3) that dictates how a ball will move. The ball movement is determined by these directions, and the grid updates as balls pass through cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that the starting column for each ball is within the bounds of the grid's columns.\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': This specifies the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': This specifies the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize the grid with the given directions.\n    2. For each ball dropped:\n       - Start from the specified column in the first row.\n       - Follow the direction in each cell (right, down, or left) until the ball exits the grid.\n       - Update the direction of each cell to '2' (down) after the ball leaves it.\n       - Record the column where the ball exits.\n    3. Return the list of exit columns for all balls.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Grid size is 1x1 with a direction of 2: \n       Input: 1 1 1\n              2\n              1\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: The ball moves down and exits immediately since there's only one cell.\n       \n    2. All cells direct to the right and form a loop:\n       Input: 3 3 1\n              1 1 3\n              2 2 2\n              2 2 2\n              1\n       Output: 3\n       Explanation: The ball moves right until it exits at column 3.\n       \n    3. Large grid with all cells directing down:\n       Input: 1000 1000 1\n              (all cells are '2')\n              500\n       Output: 500\n       Explanation: The ball moves straight down and exits at column 500.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
