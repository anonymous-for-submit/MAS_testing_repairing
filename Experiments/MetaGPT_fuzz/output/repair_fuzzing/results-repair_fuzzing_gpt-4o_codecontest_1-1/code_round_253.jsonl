{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The key challenge is efficiently simulating the robot's movements across potentially large boards and command sequences. We will iterate over possible starting positions and simulate the execution of commands, keeping track of the maximum number of commands executed without falling off the board. Given the constraints, we will optimize the simulation to avoid unnecessary computations and ensure the solution is efficient for large input sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'checkered rectangular board'\n    Explanation: The board is a grid with n rows and m columns, where the robot can move between adjacent cells.\n\n    'sequence of commands'\n    Explanation: A string of characters ('L', 'R', 'D', 'U') representing the robot's movements on the board.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible': means executing the maximum number of commands without the robot falling off the board.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

For each starting position, simulate the execution of the command sequence:\n        - Track the current position of the robot.\n        - Execute each command in sequence, updating the robot's position.\n        - If a command causes the robot to move off the board, stop execution for that starting position.\n        - Count the number of successfully executed commands.\n    5.
