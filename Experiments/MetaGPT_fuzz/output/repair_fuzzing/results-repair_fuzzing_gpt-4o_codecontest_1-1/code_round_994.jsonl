{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The function will iterate through the list of days, updating the height according to the rules provided. We will use simple list operations and conditionals to achieve this. The function will handle multiple test cases efficiently by processing each test case independently. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without any external libraries, as the problem is straightforward and does not require complex data structures or algorithms.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth is determined by whether it is watered or not. If watered, it grows; if not watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n\n    'watering pattern'\n    Explanation: The sequence of days on which the flower is watered (1) or not watered (0) affects its growth or death.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two consecutive days': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This means checking for two back-to-back zeros in the input list.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm on the second day.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize the height of the flower to 1 cm at the start.\n2.

Print the height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive days without water to die.\n\n    Test case: [1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but not on the next two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 1] = 8\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day due to consecutive watering and by 1 cm on the fourth day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for checking consecutive days without water and adjusting growth accordingly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on simulating the growth of a flower based on daily watering patterns.
