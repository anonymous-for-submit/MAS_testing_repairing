{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The algorithm will efficiently handle multiple test cases by iterating through each test case and applying the DFS to check for a valid path.

The DFS logic inherently checks for valid paths and avoids traps, ensuring correct handling of edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on determining the possibility of completing a level based on the grid configuration. The movement rules are straightforward, but the challenge lies in avoiding traps while reaching the destination. The solution should efficiently evaluate multiple test cases and provide clear output for each.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main game logic to determine level completion\n- Ensure the movement rules are correctly applied\n- Optimize the algorithm for handling up to 100 test cases efficiently\n- Provide clear output for each test case\n- Include feedback mechanisms for player actions\nWe will implement a function to determine if Monocarp can complete the level by checking possible paths from the starting cell to the destination cell, avoiding traps. We will use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths efficiently. The BFS approach is suitable for this problem as it systematically explores all possible moves from the starting point, ensuring that we find a path if one exists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid': A grid with 2 rows and n columns where Monocarp can move.\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner': Monocarp can move to any of the 8 surrounding cells if they are within the grid.\n    'trap cell': A cell marked with '1' that Monocarp must avoid to survive.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid has a fixed number of rows (2) and a variable number of columns (n).\n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case, read the number of columns, n, and the two rows of the grid.\n3. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore paths from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n).\n4. Initialize a queue with the starting position and a set to track visited cells.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the current position.\n   - If the current position is the destination, return \"YES\".\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), check if the move is within bounds and not a trap.\n   - If valid, add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n6. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all safe cells:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: There are no traps, so Monocarp can easily reach the destination.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking all paths:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: All possible paths are blocked by traps.\n\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input:\n    1\n    3\n    010\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (2, 2) to (2, 3).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
