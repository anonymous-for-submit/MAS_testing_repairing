{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The flower can grow, remain the same, or die depending on whether it is watered or neglected.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two consecutive days': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This means checking for two successive zeros in the input list.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on two consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start.\n    - Iterate through each test case:\n      - For each day in the test case:\n        - If the current day is watered (1) and the previous day was also watered (1), increase height by 5 cm.\n        - If only the current day is watered, increase height by 1 cm.\n        - If two consecutive days are not watered (0), set height to -1 and break out of the loop.\n    - Return the final height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it requires two consecutive days of neglect to die. The height remains 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: [1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but neglected for two consecutive days afterward, causing it to die.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 1] = 7\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the first two days due to consecutive watering, doesn't grow on the third day, and grows by 1 cm on the fourth day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
