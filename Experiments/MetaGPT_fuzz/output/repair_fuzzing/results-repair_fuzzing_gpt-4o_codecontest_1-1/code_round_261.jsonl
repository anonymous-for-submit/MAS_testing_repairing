{"name": "1619_C. Wrong Addition", "description": "Tanya is learning how to add numbers, but so far she is not doing it correctly. She is adding two numbers a and b using the following algorithm:\n\n  1. If one of the numbers is shorter than the other, Tanya adds leading zeros so that the numbers are the same length. \n  2. The numbers are processed from right to left (that is, from the least significant digits to the most significant). \n  3. In the first step, she adds the last digit of a to the last digit of b and writes their sum in the answer. \n  4. At each next step, she performs the same operation on each pair of digits in the same place and writes the result to the left side of the answer. \n\n\n\nFor example, the numbers a = 17236 and b = 3465 Tanya adds up as follows:\n\n$$$ \\large{ \\begin{array}{r} + \\begin{array}{r} 17236\\\\\\ 03465\\\\\\ \\end{array} \\\\\\ \\hline \\begin{array}{r} 1106911 \\end{array} \\end{array}} $$$\n\n  * calculates the sum of 6 + 5 = 11 and writes 11 in the answer. \n  * calculates the sum of 3 + 6 = 9 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 911. \n  * calculates the sum of 2 + 4 = 6 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 6911. \n  * calculates the sum of 7 + 3 = 10, and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 106911. \n  * calculates the sum of 1 + 0 = 1 and writes the result to the left side of the answer and get 1106911. \n\n\n\nAs a result, she gets 1106911.\n\nYou are given two positive integers a and s. Find the number b such that by adding a and b as described above, Tanya will get s. Or determine that no suitable b exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers a and s (1 \u2264 a < s \u2264 10^{18}) separated by a space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer on a separate line.\n\nIf the solution exists, print a single positive integer b. The answer must be written without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.\n\nIf no suitable number b exists, output -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n17236 1106911\n1 5\n108 112\n12345 1023412\n1 11\n1
