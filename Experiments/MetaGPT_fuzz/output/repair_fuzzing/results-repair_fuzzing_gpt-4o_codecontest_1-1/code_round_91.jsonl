{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The solution must handle large board sizes and long command sequences efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient algorithm to determine starting position\n- Ensure correct handling of edge cases\n- Optimize for large board sizes\n- Provide clear output format\n- Allow multiple test case inputs\nWe will implement a function that simulates the robot's movement on the board. The function will iterate over all possible starting positions on the board and simulate the execution of the command sequence from each position. It will track the number of commands successfully executed before the robot falls off the board. The starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed will be selected. Given the constraints, the solution must be efficient, so we will use a greedy approach to minimize unnecessary computations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'robot movement'\n    Explanation: The robot can move in four directions: left ('L'), right ('R'), down ('D'), and up ('U') on a checkered board. The goal is to determine the starting position that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off the board.\n\n    'checkered rectangular board'\n    Explanation: The board is defined by dimensions n (rows) and m (columns), and the robot can start from any cell within these dimensions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible': This means we need to maximize the number of commands executed without the robot falling off the board.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This refers to executing the highest possible number of commands from a starting position without falling off the board.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the dimensions of the board (n, m) and the sequence of commands (s).\n3.

For each starting position, simulate the robot's movement according to the command sequence.\n6. Track the number of commands executed before the robot falls off the board.\n7. Update the best starting position if a new maximum is found.\n8. Output the best starting position for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 1\n    L = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 1x1 board, any movement will cause the robot to fall off immediately, so the starting position doesn't matter.\n\n    2 2\n    RR = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 2x2 board, starting from (1,1) allows executing one 'R' command before falling off.\n\n    3 3\n    UUU = 3 1\n    Explanation: Starting from (3,1) allows executing all 'U' commands without falling off.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of simulating movements from all possible starting positions inherently handles these cases by checking boundary conditions during simulation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe main requirement is to determine the optimal starting position for the robot on a grid to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off.
