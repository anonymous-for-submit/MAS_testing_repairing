{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The original logic of simulating each ball's path through the grid will naturally handle these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe game requires efficient handling of ball drops across a grid with dynamic direction changes. The solution must account for edge cases and ensure performance does not degrade with large input sizes. The output should be clear and concise, indicating the final column for each ball.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient ball drop algorithm for large grids.\n- Ensure accurate tracking of ball paths and final positions.\n- Optimize performance for handling up to 100,000 ball drops.\n- Provide visual representation of ball paths.\n- Develop intuitive UI for easy navigation and understanding.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the dropping of balls in a grid. The function will iterate over each ball's starting column, simulate its path through the grid based on the direction values, and determine the final column where it exits the grid. We will use a simple loop to handle the ball movements and update the grid directions as specified. The solution will be efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints of the problem using basic Python data structures.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'matrix of dimensions n \u00d7 m'\n    Explanation: This refers to a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell contains a direction for the ball to move.\n\n    'direction the ball will travel'\n    Explanation: Each cell in the matrix has a value (1, 2, or 3) that determines the direction the ball will move: right, down, or left, respectively.\n\n    'switch to 2'\n    Explanation: When a ball leaves a cell, the direction in that cell changes to 2, meaning any subsequent ball will move down from that cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the starting column for each ball is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this means we need to ensure that the column indices are within this range when processing input.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the dimensions of the grid (n, m), number of balls (k), the grid itself, and the starting columns for each ball.\n2. For each ball:\n   - Start at the specified column in the first row.\n   - While the ball is within the grid:\n     - Check the direction in the current cell.\n     - Move the ball according to the direction (right, down, or left).\n     - Change the direction in the current cell to 2 if it was not already 2.\n   - Record the column where the ball exits the grid.\n3. Output the final column for each ball.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: A grid with only one row and one column (1x1 grid).\n    Input: 1 1 1\n           1\n           1\n    Expected Output: 2\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 1 and moves right, exiting at column 2.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A grid where all cells initially direct balls to move left.\n    Input: 3 3 1\n           3 3 3\n           3 3 3\n           3 3 3\n           2\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 2, moves left to column 1, and exits.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A grid where all cells initially direct balls to move down.\n    Input: 2 2 1\n           2 2\n           2 2\n           1\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: The ball starts at column 1 and moves down until it exits.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle these edge cases.
