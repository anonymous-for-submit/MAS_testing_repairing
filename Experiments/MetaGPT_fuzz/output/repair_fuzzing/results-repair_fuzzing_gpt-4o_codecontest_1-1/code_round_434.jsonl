{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.  The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1"], "completions": ["from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef calculate_flower_height(t: int, test_cases: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the final height of the flower for each test case.\n\n    Args:\n        t (int): Number of test cases.\n        test_cases (List[List[int]]): List of test cases, each containing a list of integers\n                                      representing the watering pattern over n days.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: List of integers representing the final height of the flower for each test case,\n                   or -1 if the flower dies.\n    \"\"\"\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        height = 1  # Initial height of the flower\n        previous_day_watered = False\n        flower_dead = False\n        \n        for day in case:\n            if day == 1:\n                if previous_day_watered:\n                    height += 5\n                else:\n                    height += 1\n                previous_day_watered = True\n            else:\n                if not previous_day_watered:\n                    flower_dead = True\n                    break\n                previous_day_watered = False\n        \n        if flower_dead:\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            results.append(height)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to handle input and output.\"\"\"\n    t = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        watering_pattern = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append(watering_pattern)\n    \n    results = calculate_flower_height(t, test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef calculate_flower_height(t: int, test_cases: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the height of the flower based on the watering pattern over a series of days.\n\n    Args:\n        t (int): Number of test cases.\n        test_cases (List[List[int]]): List of test cases, each containing a list of integers representing the watering pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: List of integers representing the final height of the flower for each test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    results = []\n    \n    for watering_pattern in test_cases:\n        height = 1  # Initial height of the flower\n        consecutive_unwatered_days = 0  # Counter for consecutive unwatered days\n        previous_day_watered = False  # Flag to check if the previous day was watered\n        \n        for day in watering_pattern:\n            if day == 1:\n                if previous_day_watered:\n                    height += 5  # Grow by 5 cm for consecutive watered days\n                else:\n                    height += 1  # Grow by 1 cm for a single watered day\n                previous_day_watered = True\n                consecutive_unwatered_days = 0  # Reset unwatered days counter\n            else:\n                consecutive_unwatered_days += 1\n                previous_day_watered = False\n                if consecutive_unwatered_days == 2:\n                    height = -1  # Flower dies\n                    break\n        \n        results.append(height)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to handle input and output.\"\"\"\n    t = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        watering_pattern = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append(watering_pattern)\n    \n    results = calculate_flower_height(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef calculate_flower_height(n: int, watering_pattern: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the final height of the flower after n days based on the watering pattern.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): Number of days.\n        watering_pattern (List[int]): List indicating whether the flower is watered (1) or not (0) each day.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The final height of the flower or -1 if the flower dies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm at the start\n    height = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each day's watering status\n    for i in range(n):\n        if watering_pattern[i] == 1:\n            # Check if the previous day was also watered\n            if i > 0 and watering_pattern[i -
