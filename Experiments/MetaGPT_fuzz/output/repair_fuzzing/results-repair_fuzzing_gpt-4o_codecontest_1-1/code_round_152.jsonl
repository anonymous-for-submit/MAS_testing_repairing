{"name": "1618_E. Singers' Tour", "description": "n towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. In the i-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of a_i minutes for each i \u2208 [1, n].\n\nEach singer visited all n towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the i-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts a_i minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.\n\nHence, for the i-th singer, the concert in the i-th town will last a_i minutes, in the (i + 1)-th town the concert will last 2 \u22c5 a_i minutes, ..., in the ((i + k) mod n + 1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k + 2) \u22c5 a_i, ..., in the town ((i + n - 2) mod n + 1) \u2014 n \u22c5 a_i minutes.\n\nYou are given an array of b integer numbers, where b_i is the total duration of concerts in the i-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers a or say that it is impossible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^3) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of cities. The second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^{9}) \u2014 the total duration of concerts in i-th city.\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the answer as follows:\n\nIf there is no suitable sequence a, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES, on the next line print the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n of n integers, where a_i (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}) is the initial duration of repertoire of the i-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n12 16 14\n1\n1\n3\n1 2 3\n6\n81 75 75 93 93 87\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n3 1 3 \nYES\n1 \nNO\nYES\n5 5 4 1 4 5 \n\nNote\n\nLet's consider the 1-st test case of the example:\n\n  1. the 1-st singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 6 minutes, in the 3-rd \u2014 for 9 minutes; \n  2. the 2-nd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 1 minute, in the 3-rd - for 2 minutes; \n  3. the 3-rd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 6 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 9 minutes, in the 3-rd \u2014 for 3 minutes.
