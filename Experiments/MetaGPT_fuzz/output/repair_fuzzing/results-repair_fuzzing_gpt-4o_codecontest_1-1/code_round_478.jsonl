{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The function will iterate through each day, updating the flower's height according to the rules specified. We will use simple list operations to handle the input and output efficiently. The solution will be optimized to handle up to 100 test cases by processing each test case independently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'flower growth'\n    Explanation: The flower's growth is determined by the watering pattern over n days. It grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day, by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days, and dies if not watered for two consecutive days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates that the flower dies if it is not watered for two consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive elements in the list are 0.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This means the flower's height increases by 1 cm if watered on a single day. In code, this can be implemented by adding 1 to the height when a 1 is encountered in the list.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This means the flower's height increases by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by adding 5 to the height when two consecutive 1s are encountered in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm.\n    - Iterate through each test case independently.\n    - For each test case, iterate through the list of days:\n        - If two consecutive days are not watered (0, 0), set height to -1 and break the loop.\n        - If a day is watered (1) and the previous day was also watered (1), increase height by 5 cm.\n        - If a day is watered (1) and the previous day was not watered (0), increase height by 1 cm.\n    - Output the final height for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 2\n           2\n           0 0\n           3\n           1 0 0\n    Output: -1\n            -1\n    Explanation: In both test cases, the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies, resulting in a height of -1.\n\n    Input: 2\n           2\n           1 1\n           3\n           1 1 1\n    Output: 6\n            11\n    Explanation: In both test cases, the flower is watered consecutively, resulting in growth of 5 cm per consecutive watering after the initial day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for scenarios where the flower dies or grows based on watering patterns.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on simulating the growth of a flower based on watering patterns over n days.

If true, set height to -1 (flower dies) and break out of the loop.\n3. After processing all days, store the final height for each test case.\n4. Output the results for all test cases.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: [0] = 1\n    Explanation: The flower starts at 1 cm and is not watered on the first day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive days without water to die.\n\n    Test case: [1, 0, 0] = -1\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first day but not on the second and third days, leading to its death.\n\n    Test case: [1, 1, 0, 1] = 7\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day (consecutive watering) and by 1 cm on the fourth day, totaling a height of 7 cm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already accounts for consecutive days without watering and adjusts growth accordingly.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 478, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
