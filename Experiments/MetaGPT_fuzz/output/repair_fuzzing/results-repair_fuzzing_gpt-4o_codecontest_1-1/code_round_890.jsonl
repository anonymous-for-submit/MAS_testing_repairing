{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The function will update the grid as balls move, ensuring that each cell's direction changes to 'down' once a ball passes through.

We will use simple loops and conditionals to navigate the grid and update the direction of cells as balls pass through them.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid of size n by m'\n    Explanation: This refers to a two-dimensional array with n rows and m columns, where each cell contains a direction for the ball to move.\n\n    'direction in which the ball will head'\n    Explanation: Each cell in the grid has a value (1, 2, or 3) that determines the direction the ball will move when it enters that cell.\n\n    'release k balls in succession'\n    Explanation: k balls are dropped one after another, each starting from a specified column in the first row.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the starting column for each ball is between 1 and m, inclusive. In code, this means we need to ensure that the column index is within this range when accessing the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list to store the final column positions for each ball.\n2. For each ball, start at the specified column in the first row.\n3. Use a loop to simulate the ball's movement through the grid:\n   - Check the direction of the current cell.\n   - Move the ball to the next cell based on the direction (right, down, or left).\n   - Update the current cell's direction to 2 (down) after the ball leaves it.\n   - Continue until the ball exits the grid.\n4.

The primary challenge is to ensure that the game can process up to 100,000 ball drops efficiently while updating the grid state in real-time. The grid's constraints ensure that balls will not exit the grid from the leftmost or rightmost columns initially, simplifying edge case handling.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient ball movement logic across the grid.\n- Ensure the game can handle up to 100,000 ball drops without performance issues.\n- Provide a visual representation of the ball's path for better user engagement.\n- Allow users to reset the grid to its initial state.\n- Include a tutorial or instructions for new players.\nWe will implement a function to simulate the movement of balls across the grid based on the given directions.
