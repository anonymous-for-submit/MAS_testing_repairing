{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

A level is a rectangular grid with two rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1, obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns. The character can move to adjacent cells, including diagonally, but cannot move outside the grid or onto a trap.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles all edge cases, such as maximum grid size and complex trap configurations.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle the upper limits of input constraints.\n- Provide detailed comments and documentation for the code.\n- Consider adding a feature to visualize the pathfinding process.\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using Depth First Search (DFS) to determine if Monocarp can reach the destination cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) without stepping on any traps. The algorithm will explore all possible paths and backtrack when a trap is encountered. This approach is suitable given the constraints and will efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with grids of up to 100 columns.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid', 'adjacent by side and/or corner', 'trap cell'\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2-row structure with n columns, where movement is allowed to adjacent cells either by side or corner. Trap cells ('1') are dangerous and must be avoided to complete the level.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two rows and n columns': The grid has a fixed number of rows (2) and a variable number of columns (n).\n    Explanation: This defines the structure of the grid, which is crucial for understanding the movement possibilities and constraints.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read the number of columns and the two rows representing the grid.\n    3. Implement a DFS algorithm starting from cell (1, 1) to explore all possible paths to cell (2, n).\n    4. Use a stack or recursion to manage the exploration of paths.\n    5. Mark cells as visited to avoid revisiting them.\n    6. If cell (2, n) is reached without encountering a trap, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward with no traps, allowing direct movement from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    6\n    010101\n    101010\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: Despite alternating traps, a zigzag path can be formed to reach the destination safely.\n\n    Test case with blocked path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Output: NO\n    Explanation: The path is completely blocked by traps, making it impossible to reach the destination.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

Trap cells ('1') are dangerous and must be avoided to complete the level.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two rows and n columns': The grid has a fixed number of rows (2) and a variable number of columns (n).\n    Explanation: This defines the structure of the grid, which is crucial for understanding the movement possibilities.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the grid for each test case.\n    2. Implement a DFS function to explore paths from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n).\n    3. Use a visited set to keep track of visited cells to prevent cycles.\n    4. For each cell, check if moving to adjacent cells is possible without hitting a trap.\n    5. If the destination cell (2, n) is reached, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward as all cells are safe.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking all paths:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Output: NO\n    Explanation: All paths are blocked by traps, making it impossible to reach the destination.\n\n    Test case with alternating safe and trap cells:\n    Input:\n    1\n    6\n    010101\n    101010\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path can be taken to reach the destination safely.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
