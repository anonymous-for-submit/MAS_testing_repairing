The custom sorting logic inherently handles all cases, including edge cases, by applying the specified sorting rules consistently across all input strings.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to sort a list of book titles based on a custom lexicographical order where odd-indexed characters are sorted ascendingly and even-indexed characters are sorted descendingly. The solution must efficiently handle up to 10^6 characters in total, ensuring performance and correctness across multiple test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the sorting algorithm for asc-desc-ending order.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases with minimum and maximum input sizes.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance given the constraint of 10^6 characters.\n- Provide clear documentation and comments within the code.\n- Include unit tests to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithm.\nWe will implement a custom sorting function that compares strings based on the specified asc-desc-ending order. The function will iterate over each character of the strings, comparing them according to their index (odd or even) and applying the appropriate lexicographical order. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities with a custom key function to achieve this efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'asc-desc-ending order'\n    Explanation: This is a custom sorting order where odd-indexed characters are sorted in ascending lexicographical order, and even-indexed characters are sorted in descending lexicographical order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of books (n) and the length of each book title (m).\n    2. Store each book title in a list along with its original index.\n    3. Define a custom sorting function that:\n       - Iterates over each character in the book titles.\n       - Compares characters at odd indices in ascending order.\n       - Compares characters at even indices in descending order.\n    4. Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with the custom sorting function as the key.\n    5. Extract and print the original indices of the sorted book titles.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 1 1\n           A\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one book, it remains in its original position.\n\n    Input: 2 3\n           ABC\n           ACB\n    Output: 2 1\n    Explanation: At index 2 (even), 'C' in ACB is greater than 'B' in ABC, so ACB comes first.\n\n    Input: 3 2\n           AB\n           AC\n           AD\n    Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: All books have the same character at index 1 (odd), so they are sorted by index 2 (even) in descending order.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
