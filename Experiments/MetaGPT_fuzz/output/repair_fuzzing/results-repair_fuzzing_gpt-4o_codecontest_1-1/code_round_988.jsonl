{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases, each with a grid of up to 100 columns. The key challenge is to navigate around traps while ensuring the path remains within the grid boundaries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to navigate the grid.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases, such as maximum grid size.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance.\n- Provide detailed output for each test case.\n- Consider additional features like visualizing the path.\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm using a simple depth-first search (DFS) approach to navigate the grid. The algorithm will check if a path exists from the starting cell (1, 1) to the ending cell (2, n) while avoiding traps.

The solution should efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with grids of up to 100 columns.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the pathfinding algorithm to determine if the level can be completed.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases, such as maximum grid size and complex trap configurations.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear output for each test case indicating success or failure.\n- Consider user interface elements for visualizing the pathfinding process.\nWe will implement a pathfinding algorithm to determine if Monocarp can reach the destination cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2-row grid. The algorithm will use a simple depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore possible paths, ensuring that the character does not step on trap cells. Given the constraints, this approach will efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with grids of up to 100 columns.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns'\n    Explanation: The game level is represented as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell can either be safe ('0') or a trap ('1').\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: The character can move to any of the 8 surrounding cells (including diagonals) as long as they are within the grid boundaries.\n\n    'complete the level'\n    Explanation: The goal is to determine if there is a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n) without stepping on any trap cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid has a fixed number of rows (2) and a variable number of columns (n).\n\n    '|x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1': This describes the movement constraint, allowing movement to adjacent cells.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read the number of columns and the two grid rows.\n    3. Implement a pathfinding algorithm (DFS or BFS) starting from cell (1, 1).\n    4. Use a queue or stack to explore all possible paths, ensuring not to step on trap cells ('1').\n    5. Mark visited cells to avoid re-processing.\n    6. If the destination cell (2, n) is reached, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with all safe cells:\n    Input: \n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: There are no traps, so reaching the destination is straightforward.\n\n    Test case with traps blocking all paths:\n    Input:\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: All possible paths are blocked by traps.\n\n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input:\n    3\n    010\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: A path exists from (1, 1) to (2, 3) via (2, 2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original pathfinding logic will naturally handle these scenarios by checking all possible paths and ensuring no traps are stepped on.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 988, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
