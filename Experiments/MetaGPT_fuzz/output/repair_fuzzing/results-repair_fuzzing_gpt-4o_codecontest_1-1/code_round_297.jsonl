We will use Python's built-in gcd function from the math library to ensure efficient computation. The algorithm will be designed to handle large input sizes by minimizing unnecessary computations and leveraging mathematical insights.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'greatest common divisor (GCD)'\n    Explanation: The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. It is a fundamental concept in number theory and is used to determine the number of integer pairs (i, j) such that l \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 r and gcd(i, j) \u2265 l.\n\n    'minimum sum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the minimum possible sum of c(l, r) over all integer sequences that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than or equal to (\u2265)'\n    Explanation: In the context of gcd(i, j) \u2265 l, it means that the greatest common divisor of i and j must be at least l.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'greatest'\n    Explanation: Refers to the largest positive integer that divides both i and j without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the values of n and k for each test case.\n    2. For each test case, initialize a sequence with 0 as the first element and n as the last element.\n    3. Calculate c(l, r) for each segment in the sequence using Python's built-in gcd function.\n    4. Optimize the sequence to minimize the sum of c(l, r) by leveraging mathematical insights into gcd properties.\n    5. Output the minimum sum for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    f(1, 1) = 0\n    Explanation: With n = 1 and k = 1, the sequence is [0, 1]. There are no pairs (i, j) such that l \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 r, so the sum is 0.\n\n    f(2, 1) = 1\n    Explanation: With n = 2 and k = 1, the sequence is [0, 2]. The pair (1, 2) satisfies gcd(1, 2) \u2265 1, so c(1, 2) = 1.\n\n    f(10^5, 1) = large value\n    Explanation: With n = 10^5 and k = 1, the sequence is [0, 10^5]. The calculation involves a large range, testing the efficiency of the algorithm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle edge cases efficiently.\n        if k == 1:\n            # Special handling for k = 1\n            return c(1, n)\n        # Other code logic for general cases\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 297, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 f(n, k).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 2\n4 4\n3 1\n10 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n8\n4\n6\n11\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, YouKn0wWho can select the sequence [0, 2, 6].
