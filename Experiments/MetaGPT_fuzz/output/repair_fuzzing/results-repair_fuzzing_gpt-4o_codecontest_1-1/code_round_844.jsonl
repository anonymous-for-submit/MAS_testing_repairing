{"name": "1591_C. Minimize Distance", "description": "A total of n depots are located on a number line. Depot i lies at the point x_i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n\nYou are a salesman with n bags of goods, attempting to deliver one bag to each of the n depots. You and the n bags are initially at the origin 0. You can carry up to k bags at a time. You must collect the required number of goods from the origin, deliver them to the respective depots, and then return to the origin to collect your next batch of goods.\n\nCalculate the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. You do not have to return to the origin after you have delivered all the bags.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 500). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_n (-10^9 \u2264 x_i \u2264 10^9). It is possible that some depots share the same position.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7 4\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n4 2\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n25\n41\n7\n3000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can carry only one bag at a time. Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: 0 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 5, where each 0 means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of 25 units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41. It can be shown that 41 is the optimal distance for this test case.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7

The key challenge is optimizing the delivery route to minimize travel distance while considering the constraint of carrying a limited number of bags at a time. The solution must handle large input sizes efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient route planning algorithm\n- Ensure solution handles maximum input constraints\n- Optimize for minimal travel distance\n- Support multiple test cases in a single run\n- Provide clear and accurate output format\nWe will implement an efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum distance required to deliver all bags to the depots. The approach involves sorting the depot positions, separating them into positive and negative coordinates, and then calculating the distance by grouping the depots into batches of size k. We will use the Python standard library for sorting and basic arithmetic operations to ensure the solution is scalable and efficient for large input sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'minimum distance'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the shortest possible distance to deliver all bags to the depots, considering the constraint of carrying a limited number of bags at a time.\n\n    'origin'\n    Explanation: The starting point for the salesman is at position 0 on the number line, and all deliveries begin from this point.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'up to k bags at a time': This indicates that the salesman can carry a maximum of k bags in one trip. In code, this means we need to group the deliveries into batches of size k.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This means we need to find the smallest possible total distance traveled. In code, this involves optimizing the delivery route to minimize the distance.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read n and k, and then read the positions of depots.\n    3. Separate depot positions into positive and negative lists.\n    4. Sort both lists in descending order (for positive) and ascending order (for negative).\n    5. Calculate the total distance by grouping depots into batches of size k and summing up the round-trip distances for each batch.\n    6. Ensure that after delivering all bags, you do not need to return to the origin.\n    7.

Sort both lists in descending order of absolute values.\n5. For each list, calculate the total distance by grouping depots into batches of size k, and compute the round-trip distance for each batch except the last one, which is a one-way trip.\n6. Sum the distances from both positive and negative sides to get the total minimum distance for each test case.\n7. Output the result for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case 1: n = 1, k = 1, depots = [0] = 0\n    Explanation: The depot is at the origin, so no travel is needed.\n\n    Test case 2: n = 3, k = 3, depots = [-1, 0, 1] = 1\n    Explanation: All depots can be serviced in one trip without returning to origin after delivery.\n\n    Test case 3: n = 5, k = 2, depots = [-10^9, -10^9, 10^9, 10^9, 0] = 4000000000\n    Explanation: The farthest depots require separate trips due to their extreme positions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle these edge cases. The original logic of sorting and grouping handles them effectively by considering both positive and negative positions separately and ensuring that all depots are serviced with minimal travel.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 844, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.
