{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

Calculate the total duration of all songs.\n2. Use dynamic programming to determine if it's possible to achieve a certain sum of durations for one of the concerts.\n3. Iterate over possible sums to find the one that results in the minimal difference when compared to the total duration.\n4. For each test case, output the minimal possible difference.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: (1, 0, 0) = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, it must be placed in one concert, resulting in a difference of 1 minute.\n\n    Edge Case 2: (0, 0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: No songs are present, so the difference is naturally 0.\n\n    Edge Case 3: (1, 1, 1) = 0\n    Explanation: As explained in the example, a one-minute and a two-minute song can be placed in one concert and a three-minute song in another, resulting in a difference of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where there are no songs or only one type of song.\n    \n```python\ndef minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        if total_duration == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        # Initialize DP array\n        dp = [False] * (total_duration // 2 + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        # Update DP array for each song type\n        for _ in range(a):\n            for j in range(total_duration // 2, 0, -1):\n                if j >= 1:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 1]\n        \n        for _ in range(b):\n            for j in range(total_duration // 2, 1, -1):\n                if j >= 2:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 2]\n        \n        for _ in range(c):\n            for j in range(total_duration // 2, 2, -1):\n                if j >= 3:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - 3]\n        \n        # Find minimal difference\n        min_diff = total_duration\n        for i in range(total_duration // 2 + 1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(total_duration - 2 * i))\n        \n        results.append(min_diff)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\nt = 4\ntest_cases = [(1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 3), (5, 5, 5), (1, 1, 2)]\nprint(minimal_difference(t, test_cases)) # Output: [0, 1, 0, 1]\n```\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 12, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert.
