{"name": "1591_C. Minimize Distance", "description": "A total of n depots are located on a number line. Depot i lies at the point x_i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n\nYou are a salesman with n bags of goods, attempting to deliver one bag to each of the n depots. You and the n bags are initially at the origin 0. You can carry up to k bags at a time. You must collect the required number of goods from the origin, deliver them to the respective depots, and then return to the origin to collect your next batch of goods.\n\nCalculate the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. You do not have to return to the origin after you have delivered all the bags.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 500). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_n (-10^9 \u2264 x_i \u2264 10^9). It is possible that some depots share the same position.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7 4\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n4 2\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n25\n41\n7\n3000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can carry only one bag at a time. Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: 0 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 5, where each 0 means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of 25 units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41. It can be shown that 41 is the optimal distance for this test case.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n9 3\n-5 -10 -15 6 5 8 3 7

The solution must efficiently handle multiple test cases and large input sizes, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient algorithm for minimum distance calculation\n- Ensure scalability for large number of depots\n- Optimize code for performance and accuracy\n- Handle edge cases and input variations\n- Provide clear documentation and maintainability\nWe will implement an efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum distance required to deliver goods to depots on a number line. The approach will involve sorting the depot positions and grouping them based on the number of bags that can be carried at a time. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to handle large input sizes efficiently. The algorithm will ensure that depots with the same position are handled correctly by considering them as a single point in the route calculation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'number line'\n    Explanation: The depots are located on a linear path, which means the salesman can move back and forth along this line to deliver goods.\n\n    'origin'\n    Explanation: The starting point for the salesman, where all goods are initially located and where the salesman returns to collect more goods.\n\n    'carry up to k bags'\n    Explanation: The salesman can transport a maximum of k bags in one trip from the origin to the depots.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'up to k bags': This indicates a limit on the number of bags that can be carried in one trip. In code, this can be implemented by grouping the depot positions into batches of size k.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This indicates that the goal is to find the least possible distance traveled. In code, this can be implemented by optimizing the route taken to deliver goods.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read n and k, and then read the positions of depots.\n3. Separate depot positions into positive and negative lists.\n4. Sort both lists in descending order.\n5. Calculate the total distance by grouping depot positions into batches of size k and summing twice the farthest position in each batch (except for the last batch).\n6.

Parse the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read n and k, and the list of depot positions.\n    3. Separate depot positions into positive and negative lists.\n    4. Sort both lists in descending order of absolute value.\n    5. Calculate the total distance by delivering goods in batches of k, prioritizing farthest depots first.\n    6. Sum the distances for all trips, ensuring not to return to origin after final delivery.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all depots at the same position:\n    Input: 4 2\n           1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n    Expected output: 3000000000\n    Explanation: All depots are at the same position, so only one trip is needed for each batch.\n\n    Test case with depots at origin:\n    Input: 3 1\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No travel is needed as all depots are at the origin.\n\n    Test case with maximum negative and positive positions:\n    Input: 2 1\n           -1000000000 1000000000\n    Expected output: 2000000000\n    Explanation: Two trips are needed, one to each extreme position.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 500).

It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.
