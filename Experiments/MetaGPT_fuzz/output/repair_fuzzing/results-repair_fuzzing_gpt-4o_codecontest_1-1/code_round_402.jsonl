{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

The approach involves pairing the two most sociable people repeatedly until no more talks can be made. This ensures that the maximum number of interactions is achieved. We will use a priority queue (heap) to efficiently manage and retrieve the most sociable participants.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can participate in before leaving the meeting. A person with a sociability of 0 leaves immediately, while others can engage in talks up to their sociability limit.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the total number of talks that occur during the meeting by strategically pairing individuals based on their sociability.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly a_i talks'\n    Explanation: Each person can participate in exactly a_i talks before they leave the meeting. This means that the number of talks a person can engage in is limited by their sociability value.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The aim is to achieve the highest number of talks possible by pairing individuals optimally.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive'\n    Explanation: The meeting is considered most productive when the maximum number of possible talks has occurred. This involves utilizing each person's sociability to its fullest extent.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to retrieve the number of test cases and details for each test case.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) to store people based on their sociability.\n   - Continuously pair the two most sociable people until no more valid pairs can be made.\n   - For each pair, decrement their sociability and record the interaction.\n3. Output the total number of interactions and the pairs for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test Case 1: \n    Input: 2, [0, 0]\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: Both people have zero sociability, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test Case 2:\n    Input: 3, [1, 0, 1]\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: Only two people can talk once, as one person has zero sociability.\n\n    Test Case 3:\n    Input: 4, [2, 2, 0, 0]\n    Output: 2\n    Explanation: The two people with sociability of 2 can talk twice with each other.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a priority queue will naturally handle cases where some people have zero sociability or when no more valid pairs can be made.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting given the sociability constraints of each participant. The solution should efficiently handle multiple test cases and large input sizes, ensuring that the output format is clear and adheres to the specified requirements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to maximize the number of talks.\n- Ensure the solution handles up to 2 \u22c5 10^5 participants efficiently.\n- Provide a clear and concise output format for each test case.\n- Optimize the algorithm for large input sizes.\n- Consider edge cases where some participants have zero sociability.\nWe will use a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of talks. The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available until no more talks can be made. This approach ensures that the maximum number of talks is achieved efficiently. We will use a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the sociability of each participant, allowing us to efficiently select the most sociable participants for each talk.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can participate in before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and if it is zero, the person leaves immediately.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to arrange the talks such that the total number of talks is maximized.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks': This means we need to find the arrangement of talks that results in the highest total number of talks. In code, this can be implemented by continuously pairing the two most sociable people until no more talks can be made.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive': This means achieving the highest number of talks possible during the meeting.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. For each test case, read the number of people and their sociability.\n    2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the sociability of each participant.\n    3. Continuously pair the two most sociable people until no more talks can be made.\n    4. Record each pair of talks and decrement their sociability.\n    5. Output the total number of talks and the pairs involved.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero: \n    Input: 3, 0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: All participants leave immediately, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2, 0 5\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but they need a partner, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test case with two people having equal sociability:\n    Input: 2, 3 3\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: Both can talk to each other three times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a priority queue will naturally handle these scenarios by not pairing people when their sociability is zero or when no valid pairs can be formed.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 402, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting.
