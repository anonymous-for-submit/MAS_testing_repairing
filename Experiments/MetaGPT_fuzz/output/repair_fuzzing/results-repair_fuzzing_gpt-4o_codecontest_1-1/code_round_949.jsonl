{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The key challenge is ensuring the simulation accurately reflects the changes in direction and efficiently handles a large number of balls. The output must be clear and match the input format for easy interpretation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the grid-based simulation accurately.\n- Optimize the algorithm for handling up to 100,000 balls efficiently.\n- Ensure the output format is consistent and easy to interpret.\n- Handle edge cases where balls may exit the grid unexpectedly.\n- Provide documentation for understanding the simulation process.\nWe will implement a grid-based simulation using a simple function to track the movement of balls through the grid. The function will update the direction of each cell as balls pass through, ensuring the simulation accurately reflects the changes in direction. We will use efficient data structures to handle up to 100,000 balls, optimizing for performance. The output will be formatted to match the input requirements for easy interpretation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'grid-based simulation'\n    Explanation: The requirement involves simulating the movement of balls through a grid, where each cell has a direction that influences the ball's path. The grid's dimensions and the number of balls are key components.\n\n    'direction transformation'\n    Explanation: As balls pass through cells, the direction indicated by the integer in each cell changes, affecting subsequent ball movements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that the column positions from which balls are dropped must be within the grid's column range.\n    Implementation: Ensure that ball drop positions are validated to be within the grid's column limits.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.
