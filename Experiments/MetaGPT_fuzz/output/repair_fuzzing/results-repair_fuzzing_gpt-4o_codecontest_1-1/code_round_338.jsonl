{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The algorithm will explore all possible paths from the starting cell to the destination cell, checking for traps along the way.

We will ensure the solution handles multiple test cases efficiently by iterating over each test case and applying the pathfinding logic.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'rectangular grid'\n    Explanation: The game level is represented as a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell can either be safe ('0') or a trap ('1').\n\n    'adjacent by side and/or corner'\n    Explanation: The character can move to any of the 8 surrounding cells (including diagonals) from its current position, as long as it stays within the grid.\n\n    'hidden dangers'\n    Explanation: Certain cells are traps ('1'), and if the character lands on them, the game ends.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2 rows and n columns': The grid is always 2 rows high and n columns wide, where n is given for each test case.\n    \n    't (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)': The number of test cases is between 1 and 100.\n    \n    'n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100)': The number of columns in the grid is between 3 and 100.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the number of test cases, t.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of columns, n.\n   - Read the two rows of the grid.\n   - Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., BFS) to determine if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) that avoids traps.\n   - Start from cell (1, 1) and explore all possible moves to adjacent cells.\n   - If a path to (2, n) is found without encountering a trap, return \"YES\".\n   - If no such path exists, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with minimum columns:\n    Input: \n    1\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The path is straightforward as all cells are safe.\n\n    Test case with alternating traps:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0101\n    1010\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: A zigzag path can be taken to avoid traps.\n\n    Test case with no possible path:\n    Input:\n    1\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: There is no safe path from (1, 1) to (2, 4).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using BFS or DFS will naturally handle these scenarios by exploring all possible paths and checking for safety.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 338, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.
