{"name": "1579_D. Productive Meeting", "description": "An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people who will have another talk.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2\n2 3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n0 0 2\n2\n6 2\n3\n0 0 2\n5\n8 2 0 1

Python's heapq library can be used for this purpose, but since it provides a min-heap, we will store negative values to simulate a max-heap.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, sociability refers to the number of talks a person can have before leaving the meeting. It is represented by a non-negative integer for each person.\n\n    'most productive'\n    Explanation: The meeting is considered most productive when the maximum possible number of talks occurs. This means arranging the talks in such a way that utilizes the sociability of each person to its fullest.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that we need to maximize the total number of conversations that can occur during the meeting. In code, this can be implemented by continuously pairing the two most sociable individuals until no more talks can occur.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we need to achieve the highest possible number of talks. In code, this involves using a strategy (like a max-heap) to always select the individuals with the highest remaining sociability for conversations.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the number of people and their sociability values.\n3. Use a max-heap to keep track of the sociability of each person.\n4. While there are at least two people with positive sociability:\n   - Extract the two people with the highest sociability.\n   - Record a conversation between them.\n   - Decrease their sociability by one.\n   - If they still have positive sociability, push them back into the heap.\n5. Output the total number of talks and the pairs of people who talked.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all zero sociability: \n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No one can talk because all have zero sociability.\n\n    Test case with one person having high sociability and others zero:\n    Input: 3\n           5 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The person with high sociability cannot talk alone, so no talks occur.\n\n    Test case with two people having equal sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           3 3\n    Expected output: 3\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n                     1 2\n    Explanation: Both can talk to each other three times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a max-heap will naturally handle cases where no talks can occur or where only certain pairs can talk multiple times.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe solution must efficiently pair individuals for conversations to maximize the number of talks. It should handle multiple test cases and provide output in the specified format. The sociability constraints must be respected, ensuring individuals leave the meeting once their limit is reached.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently pair individuals for maximum talks\n- Handle multiple test cases\n- Respect sociability constraints\n- Provide clear output format\n- Optimize for large datasets\nWe will use a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of talks. The idea is to always pair the two most sociable people available, as this will ensure that we are using the highest available sociability at each step. We will use a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently get the most sociable people. This approach will handle multiple test cases efficiently and respect the sociability constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sociability'\n    Explanation: Sociability refers to the number of talks a person can have before leaving the meeting. It is a non-negative integer, and once a person reaches their sociability limit, they leave the meeting.\n\n    'maximum possible number of talks'\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the number of conversations that can occur during the meeting by strategically pairing individuals based on their sociability.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of talks': This means we need to find the largest number of conversations that can occur given the sociability constraints. In code, this can be implemented by continuously pairing the two most sociable individuals until no more pairs can be formed.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'most productive': This means achieving the highest number of talks possible. In code, this involves using a strategy to ensure that the maximum number of conversations occur.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the sociability parameters for each test case.\n2. For each test case, use a max-heap to keep track of the sociability of individuals.\n3. Continuously pair the two most sociable individuals until no more pairs can be formed.\n4. Record each pair and decrement their sociability.\n5. Output the total number of talks and the pairs for each test case.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all sociability values as zero: \n    Input: 3\n           0 0 0\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No talks can occur as all individuals leave immediately.\n\n    Test case with only one person having non-zero sociability:\n    Input: 2\n           0 5\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Only one person can talk, but they need a partner, so no talks can occur.\n\n    Test case with maximum sociability values:\n    Input: 2\n           200000 200000\n    Expected output: 200000\n    Explanation: The two individuals can talk to each other 200000 times.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic using a max-heap will naturally handle these scenarios by not forming pairs when it's not possible.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 241, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting.
