integers in the list are greater than zero.\n\n    'frequency'\n    Explanation: The number of times an integer appears in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': Indicates the need to find an integer greater than zero.\n    'greater than or equal to': Indicates that the frequency of an integer should be at least equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': Indicates the need to find the greatest integer that meets the frequency criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n(check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear at least as many times as their value, but 3 is the greatest integer meeting the criteria.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the integers appear at least as many times as their value, so the function returns -1.\n    search([1, 1, 1]) = -1\n    Explanation: The only integer in the list is 1, but it does not appear at least as many times as its value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge case)\n", "requirement pool:\n- Efficiently identify the greatest integer based on frequency\n- Handle edge cases where no integer meets the criteria\n- Optimize the algorithm for better performance\nWe will design a static Python function using appropriate open-source libraries to efficiently search for the greatest integer based on frequency criteria.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': means that all integers in the list are greater than 0\n    'frequency': refers to the number of times an integer appears in the list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': indicates the need to find an integer greater than 0\n    'greater than or equal to': implies that the frequency of an integer should be at least equal to its value\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': signifies the need to find the largest integer that meets the frequency criteria\n\n# [code logic]\n    The logic to implement the code involves:\n    1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary to find the greatest integer that satisfies the frequency condition.\n    4. Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear at least as many times as their values, but 3 is the greatest number meeting the criteria.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears twice, and number 4 appears thrice; none of them meets the required frequency condition, so -1 is returned.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
