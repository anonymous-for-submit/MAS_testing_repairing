This basket contains apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits in the basket, you are tasked with calculating the number of mango fruits present. Return the number of the mango fruits in the basket. for examble:\nfruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8\n    fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\",3) -> 3 - 0 -
