To optimize for large input lists, we will rely on the built-in sorting capabilities of Python.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'divisible by three'\n    Explanation: It means the indices that can be divided by three without any remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Since the plan already mentions using the sorted() function in Python to sort the elements based on the specified criteria, we can directly implement the code logic based on the plan provided.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_third([1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: In this case, all indices are not divisible by three, so the list remains the same.\n    sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) = [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    Explanation: At index 0 (divisible by 3), the value is sorted with index 6. At index 3 (divisible by 3), the value is sorted with index 9.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The plan already mentions handling edge cases such as empty input lists by returning an empty list.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.0758, 0.2348, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2273, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [132, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0, 30, 132, 132, 132], "completion": "from typing import List\ndef sort_third(l: list) -> list:\n    '''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is the same as l in the indices that aren't divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal\n    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.'''\n    \n    divisible_by_three = [val for idx, val in enumerate(l) if idx % 3 == 0]\n    sorted_divisible_by_three = sorted(divisible_by_three)\n    \n    result = [val if idx % 3 != 0 else sorted_divisible_by_three.pop(0) for idx, val in enumerate(l)]\n    \n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 356, "repair_prompt": ["def sort_third(l: list):\t\n'''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is the same as l in the indices that aren't divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal\n    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.\n>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    '''", "This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is the same as l in the indices that aren't divisible by three.
