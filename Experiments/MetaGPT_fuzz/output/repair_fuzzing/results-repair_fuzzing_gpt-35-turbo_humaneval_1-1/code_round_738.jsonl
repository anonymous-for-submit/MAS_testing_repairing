Create a new list to store the sorted values.\n    2. Iterate through the original list and check if the index is a multiple of three.\n    3. If the index is a multiple of three, extract the value and store it in a temporary list.\n    4. Sort the temporary list.\n    5. Replace the values at indices that are multiples of three with the sorted values.\n    6. Return the modified list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_third([1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: Since there are no indices that are multiples of three, the output remains the same as the input list.\n    \n    sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) = [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    Explanation: At index 2 (multiple of three), the values [3, 4, 8] are sorted and placed back in the same order at index 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
