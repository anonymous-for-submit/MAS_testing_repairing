Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1.
