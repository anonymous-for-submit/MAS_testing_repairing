def pluck(arr):	
'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The node to be plucked should be the one with the least even number. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index. The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ], If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].
Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000

    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7,

    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.

    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.

    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Ensure that the string is properly formatted before returning the result.
Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"

Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,..., so you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).

    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.

    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    The function should handle edge cases where the input arrays may contain negative values.
example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

def move_one_ball(arr):	
'''We possess a list 'arr' consisting of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N]. The numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index.

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.
For Example:

'''Task
    We have been provided with two strings, s and c, and the goal is to remove all characters in s that match any character in c. 
    then determine if the resulting string is a palindrome.
    A string is referred to as a palindrome if it reads identically backward and forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
