If the triangle is valid, calculate the area using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n    3. Round the area to 2 decimal points and return it. If the triangle is not valid, return -1.\n\n# [edge case] \n    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) = 6.00\n    Explanation: The sides 3, 4, and 5 form a valid right-angled triangle with area 6.00.\n    \n    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) = -1\n    Explanation: The sides 1, 2, and 10 do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, so they do not form a valid triangle.\n\n    triangle_area(5, 12, 13) = 30.00\n    Explanation: The sides 5, 12, and 13 form a valid right-angled triangle with area 30.00.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed to handle the edge cases.
