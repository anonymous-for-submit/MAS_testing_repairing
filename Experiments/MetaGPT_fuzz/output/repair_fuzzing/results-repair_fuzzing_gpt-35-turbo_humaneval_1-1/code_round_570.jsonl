Edge cases like 0 and negative numbers should be considered and appropriate error handling implemented.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core special factorial calculation algorithm\n- Handle edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance\nWe will design a static Python function using the math library to efficiently calculate the special factorial by multiplying factorials from n down to 1. We will handle edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers by implementing appropriate error handling. To optimize performance, we will focus on minimizing unnecessary calculations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'brazilian factorial'\n    Explanation: The Brazilian factorial is a special factorial calculation where each factorial from n down to 1 is multiplied together.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than zero': Indicates that the input integer should be positive.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the code:\n    - Check if the input integer is greater than zero\n    - Calculate the Brazilian factorial by multiplying factorials from n down to 1\n    - Return the result\n\n# [edge case] \n    special_factorial(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The factorial of 1 is 1, so the expected output is 1.\n    special_factorial(0) = 1\n    Explanation: By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1, so the expected output is 1.\n    special_factorial(-3) = Error\n    Explanation: Since the input should be greater than zero, a negative number should raise an error.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Input should be greater than zero\")\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nimport math\n\ndef special_factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the special factorial of the input integer.\n\n    Args:\n        n: An integer input for which special factorial needs to be calculated\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The special factorial of the input integer\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input integer is less than or equal to 0\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input should be greater than zero\")\n\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result *= math.factorial(i)\n\n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 570, "repair_prompt": ["def special_factorial(n):\t\n'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as:  \n    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!  \n    with n being greater than zero\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    '''", "def special_factorial(n):\t\n'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as:  \n    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!  \n    The result is calculated by multiplying factorials of decreasing numbers from n to 1. \n    with n being greater than zero\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    '''", "def special_factorial(n):\t\n'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as: brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1! with n being greater than zero\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special factorial of this integer.\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 534}
