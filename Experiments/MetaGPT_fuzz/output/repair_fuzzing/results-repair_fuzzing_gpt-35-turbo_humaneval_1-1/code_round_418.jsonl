{"task_id": "HumanEval/103", "prompt": "def rounded_avg(n, m):\t\n'''You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). To compute the average, you must first sum all the integers from n to m. Then, divide the sum by the total number of integers. Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary. If n is greater than m, return -1.\nExample:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    '''",

The average is 15/5 = 3. After rounding to the nearest integer, we get 3 which is \"0b11\" in binary.\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) = -1\n    Explanation: Since n=7 is greater than m=5, the function returns -1 as per the requirement.\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) = \"0b1111\"\n    Explanation: The sum of integers from 10 to 20 is 165. The average is 165/11 = 15. After rounding to the nearest integer, we get 15 which is \"0b1111\" in binary.\n    \n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code needed to handle the edge cases.
