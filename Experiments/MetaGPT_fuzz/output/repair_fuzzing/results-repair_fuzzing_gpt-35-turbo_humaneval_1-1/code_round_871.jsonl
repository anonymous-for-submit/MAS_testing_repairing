We will handle edge cases like empty strings and negative counts by implementing appropriate checks in the function. To maintain the original word order in the output list, we will process the input string word by word.\n\n# [edge case] \n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 0) = []\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that we need words with exactly n consonants, when n is 0, no word will have exactly 0 consonants.\n    select_words(\"\", 4) = []\n    Explanation: When the input string is empty, the function should return an empty list.\n    select_words(\"Hello world\", -1) = []\n    Explanation: Since the requirement states that we should handle negative counts gracefully, when n is negative, the function should return an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not s or n <= 0:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe main focus is on efficiently filtering words based on consonant count while handling edge cases such as empty input strings and negative consonant counts. Preserving the order of words in the output list is crucial for user experience.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement word filtering based on consonant count\n- Handle edge cases like empty input strings and negative consonant counts\n- Maintain the order of words in the output list\nWe will use the re library in Python to efficiently filter words based on consonant count while handling edge cases and maintaining word order.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'consonants'\n    Explanation: Consonants are the speech sounds that are not vowels.

Import the re library.\n    2. Define a function select_words(s, n) that takes a string s and a natural number n as input.\n    3. Use re.findall() to extract words from the input string s.\n    4. Filter the words based on the number of consonants they contain (using regular expressions).\n    5. Return the filtered words in the order they appear in the original string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 0) = []\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that we should handle cases where the number of consonants in the words might be zero gracefully, when n=0, the function should return an empty list.\n    \n    select_words(\"Hello world\", -1) = []\n    Explanation: When n is negative, there are no words with a negative number of consonants, so the function should return an empty list.\n    \n    select_words(\"\", 3) = []\n    Explanation: When the input string is empty, the function should return an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not s or n <= 0:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 0, 0, 0, 133, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nimport re\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef select_words(s: str, n: int) -> List[str]:\n    '''\n    Given a string s and a natural number n, return a list of words from string s that contain exactly n consonants,\n    in the order they appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty, return an empty list.\n    '''\n\n    if not s or n <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    def count_consonants(word):\n        return sum(1 for letter in word if letter.isalpha() and letter.lower() not in 'aeiou')\n\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', s)\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if count_consonants(word) == n]\n\n    return filtered_words\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 871, "repair_prompt": ["def select_words(s, n):\t\n'''Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement \n    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly \n    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.\n    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
