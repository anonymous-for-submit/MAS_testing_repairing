Here is a sample logic:\n    \n```python\nimport math\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result *= math.factorial(i)\n    return result\n```\n\n# [edge case] \n    special_factorial(1) = 1\n    Explanation: For n=1, the Brazilian factorial is 1! = 1.\n    \n    special_factorial(0) = 1\n    Explanation: For n=0, the Brazilian factorial is defined as 1 according to the formula.\n    \n    special_factorial(4) = 288\n    Explanation: For n=4, the Brazilian factorial calculation is 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need to handle edge cases where n is a large number to prevent computational inefficiency. One way to optimize this is by memoization to store previously calculated factorials and reuse them in subsequent calculations. This can significantly improve performance for large inputs.\n```python\nimport math\n\nfactorial_cache = {}\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i not in factorial_cache:\n            factorial_cache[i] = math.factorial(i)\n        result *= factorial_cache[i]\n    return result\n```\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1875, 0.125, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 3, 2, 16, 16], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nimport math\n\nfactorial_cache = {}\n\ndef special_factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    The Brazilian factorial is defined as:\n        brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!\n        where n > 0\n    \n    Calculate the special factorial of the input integer.\n\n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The input integer\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The special factorial of the input integer\n    '''\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i not in factorial_cache:\n            factorial_cache[i] = math.factorial(i)\n        result *= factorial_cache[i]\n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 891, "repair_prompt": ["def special_factorial(n):\t\n'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as:\n    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!\n    where n > 0\n\nRemember to handle edge cases where n might be a large number to prevent computational inefficiency.\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    '''", "'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as calculating the product of factorials of descending numbers.\n    For example, n = 4 results in 4! * 3! * 2! * 1!\n\nRemember to handle edge cases where n might be a large number to prevent computational inefficiency.\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    '''", "def special_factorial(n):\t\n'''The Brazilian factorial is defined as: where n > 0\nRemember to handle edge cases where n might be a large number to prevent computational inefficiency.\nFor example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 866}
