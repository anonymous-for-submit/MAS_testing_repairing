{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term; if the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, and the conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is [1]. 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1,
