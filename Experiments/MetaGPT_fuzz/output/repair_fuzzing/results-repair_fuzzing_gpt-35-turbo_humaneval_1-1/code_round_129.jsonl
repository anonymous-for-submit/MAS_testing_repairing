Here is a detailed logic to implement the code:\n    1. Split the input string into a list of words.\n    2. Create a dictionary mapping word representations to numerical values.\n    3. Convert the words to numbers using the dictionary.\n    4. Sort the numbers.\n    5. Convert the sorted numbers back to words.\n    6. Join the sorted words into a string and return it.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_numbers('zero one two') = 'zero one two'\n    Explanation: All numbers are in ascending order already.\n    \n    sort_numbers('nine eight seven') = 'seven eight nine'\n    Explanation: The numbers are sorted from smallest to largest.\n\n    sort_numbers('five five five') = 'five five five'\n    Explanation: All numbers are the same, so the output remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers sorting the numbers correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3802, 1.0, 0.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [121, 121, 121, 121, 121, 121, 121, 46, 121, 0], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n    '''\n    Input is a string of numbers separated by spaces, ranging from 'zero' to 'nine'.
