The logic provided can handle scenarios where no integer meets the condition.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to iterate through the list of positive integers, keep track of the frequency of each integer, and compare it with the integer value itself to find the greatest integer meeting the specified criteria. It should handle cases where no valid integer is found by returning -1.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the core logic to find the greatest integer based on frequency\n- Handle edge cases such as empty input list or all integers having frequency less than their value\n- Optimize the algorithm for better performance on large input lists\nWe will use Python and the built-in collections library to efficiently keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': All integers in the list are greater than 0.\n    'frequency': The number of times an integer appears in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': Indicates the need to find an integer greater than 0.\n    'greater than or equal to': Indicates that the frequency of an integer should be at least equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': Indicates the need to find the greatest integer that meets the conditions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The logic to implement the code involves:\n    1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary to find the greatest integer that meets the conditions.\n    4.
