following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'sum of all the even numbers'\n    Explanation: The core concept is to calculate the sum of all even numbers in the given list.\n\n    '2nd smallest element'\n    Explanation: The core concept is to find the second smallest element in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    '2nd smallest': means we need to find the element that is the second smallest in the list\n\n# [code logic]\n    For the sum of all even numbers:\n    - Initialize a variable
