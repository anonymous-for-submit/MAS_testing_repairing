{"task_id": "HumanEval/87", "prompt": "def get_row(lst, x):\t\n'''You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists, which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices, each row may contain a different number of columns. Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0. Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order. Ensure efficient handling of rows with varied column counts in your implementation by utilizing appropriate sorting and traversal techniques.\nExamples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n
