The function will iterate through the range of n, calculating the factorial or sum based on the index parity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'factorial': The product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g., factorial of 5 (5!) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\n    'index parity': Refers to whether the index is even or odd in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the code:\n    - Import the math library in Python\n    - Create an empty list to store the results\n    - Iterate through the range of n\n    - Check if the index is even or odd\n    - Calculate the factorial if even, or sum from 1 to i if odd\n    - Append the result to the list\n    - Return the final list\n\n# [edge case] \n    f(0) = []\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the list should be empty as there are no elements to calculate.\n    \n    f(1) = [1]\n    Explanation: When n is 1, the list will have one element which is the sum from 1 to 1, i.e., 1.\n    \n    f(2) = [1, 2]\n    Explanation: When n is 2, the list will have two elements. The first element is the sum from 1 to 1 (1), and the second element is the factorial of 2 (2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers scenarios where n is 0, 1, or greater than 1.\n", "requirement pool:\n- Implement the core logic to calculate factorials and sums based on index parity\n- Handle edge cases such as n = 0 or negative n values\n- Optimize the function for better performance by reducing redundant calculations\nWe will design a simple static Python function to calculate factorials and sums based on index parity using basic arithmetic operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'factorial': The product of an integer and all the integers below it down to 1.\n    'sum of numbers': The result of adding all the numbers from 1 to a given integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the code:\n    - Iterate through the range from 1 to n.\n    - For each index i:\n        - If i is even, calculate the factorial of i.\n        - If i is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i.\n        - Append the result to the list.\n    - Return the final list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    f(0) = []\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the list should be empty as there are no elements to calculate.\n    \n    f(1) = [0]\n    Explanation: When n is 1, the list will have one element at index 1 (0-based index), which is the sum of numbers from 1 to 1.\n\n    f(2) = [1, 2]\n    Explanation: When n is 2, the list will have two elements.
