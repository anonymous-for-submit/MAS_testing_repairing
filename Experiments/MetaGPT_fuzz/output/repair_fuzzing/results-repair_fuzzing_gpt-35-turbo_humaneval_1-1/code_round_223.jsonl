We will iterate through the list, keeping track of the original indices and sorting only the elements that are not divisible by three.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'divisible by three'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that we need to sort the elements at indices that are not divisible by three.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    We will design a static Python function using the built-in sorted() function to efficiently sort the list elements based on the specified criteria of divisibility by three. We will iterate through the list, keeping track of the original indices and sorting only the elements that are not divisible by three.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_third([1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: All elements are already in sorted order, and none of them are divisible by three.\n    sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) = [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    Explanation: The elements at indices not divisible by three are sorted while maintaining their original positions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan covers the sorting based on divisibility by three.\n"], "scores": [0.2348, 1.0, 0.2348, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2348, 0.1061, 0.1061, 0.1061], "pass_results": [false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [31, 132, 31, 0, 0, 0, 31, 14, 14, 14], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_third(l: list) -> list:\n    '''\n    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at these indices are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.\n    '''\n\n    # Get indices that are not divisible by three\n    indices_not_divisible_by_three = [i for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 != 0]\n\n    # Sort the elements at indices not divisible by three\n    sorted_values = sorted([l[i] for i in indices_not_divisible_by_three])\n\n    # Replace the elements at indices not divisible by three with the sorted values\n    for i, val in zip(indices_not_divisible_by_three, sorted_values):\n        l[i] = val\n\n    return l\n\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 223, "repair_prompt": ["def sort_third(l: list):\t\n'''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at these indices are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.\n>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    '''", "'''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' which keeps the same indices as the original list except for those that are divisible by three.
