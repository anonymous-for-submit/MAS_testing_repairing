Use re.findall() to extract words from the string s.\n    4. Define a regex pattern to match words with exactly n consonants.\n    5. Iterate through the words and count the number of consonants in each word.\n    6. If the count matches n, add the word to a result list.\n    7. Return the result list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 0) = []\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that we need words with exactly n consonants, when n is 0, no word will have 0 consonants, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    \n    select_words(\"\", 4) = []\n    Explanation: When the input string is empty, there are no words to check for consonant count, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    \n    select_words(\"Hello\", 3) = []\n    Explanation: The word \"Hello\" has only 2 consonants ('H' and 'l'), which is not equal to 3, so it should not be included in the result list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not s:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n", "requirement pool:\n- Implement word filtering based on consonant count\n- Maintain word order in the output list\n- Handle empty input strings gracefully\nWe will use Python and the re library to efficiently filter words based on consonant count.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'consonants'\n    Explanation: Consonants are the speech sounds that are not vowels.
