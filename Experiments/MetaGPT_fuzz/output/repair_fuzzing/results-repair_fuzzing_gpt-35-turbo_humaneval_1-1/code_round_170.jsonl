{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that includes the odd numbers from the collatz sequence.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is an assertion in mathematics relating to a sequence defined as follows: begin with any positive integer n. Then each term is derived from the preceding term as follows: if the preceding term is even, the next term is half of the preceding term. If the preceding term is odd, the next term is 3 times the preceding term plus 1. The conjecture is that regardless of what value of n, the sequence will invariably reach 1.\n\nNote: \n    1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n    2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are
