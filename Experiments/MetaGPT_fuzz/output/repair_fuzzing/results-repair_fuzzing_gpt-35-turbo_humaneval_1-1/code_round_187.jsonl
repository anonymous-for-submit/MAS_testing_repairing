After rounding, convert the result to binary.\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\t\n'''You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). You should round the answer to the nearest integer. Convert that rounded number to binary. If n is greater than m, return -1.\nExample:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    '''", "def rounded_avg(n, m):\t\n'''You are given two positive integers n and m, compute the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m) and round the answer to the nearest integer.
