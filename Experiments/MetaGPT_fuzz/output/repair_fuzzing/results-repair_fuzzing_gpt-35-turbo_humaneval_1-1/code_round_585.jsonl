Return the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. Otherwise return -1. Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. When adding any two side lengths, the result should be larger than the length of the remaining side. This condition ensures the formation of a proper triangle.\nExample:\n    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00\n    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1\n    '''", "entry_point": "triangle_area",
