{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree. The branch of a tree has non-negative integer nodes. Your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

even values or the given array is empty, return [].\nExample 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\n
