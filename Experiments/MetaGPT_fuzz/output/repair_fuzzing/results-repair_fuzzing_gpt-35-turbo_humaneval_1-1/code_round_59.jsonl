{"task_id": "HumanEval/71", "prompt": "def triangle_area(a, b, c):\t\n'''Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. Otherwise return -1. Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. To check if it's a valid triangle, you need to ensure that the sum of each combination of two sides is greater than the remaining one. This is a necessary condition for the sides to be able to form a triangle.\nExample:\n    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00\n    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1\n    '''", "entry_point": "triangle_area",
