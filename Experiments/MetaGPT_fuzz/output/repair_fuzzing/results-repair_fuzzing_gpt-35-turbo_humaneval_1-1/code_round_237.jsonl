Specifically, we will utilize the sorted() function along with list comprehensions to achieve the desired functionality.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_third([1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: In this case, all indices are not divisible by three, so the output list remains the same as the input list.\n    \n    sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) = [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    Explanation: At index 0 (divisible by 3), the value is sorted to match the value at index 6. At index 3 (divisible by 3), the value is sorted to match the value at index 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan should cover all scenarios effectively.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0682, 0.0682, 0.1288, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [132, 132, 132, 9, 9, 17, 132, 132, 132, 132], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_third(l: list) -> list:\n    '''\n    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal and sorted to the values of the corresponding indices of l.\n    '''\n\n    divisible_by_three = [val for idx, val in enumerate(l) if idx % 3 == 0]\n    sorted_divisible_by_three = sorted(divisible_by_three)\n\n    result = [val if idx % 3 != 0 else sorted_divisible_by_three.pop(0) for idx, val in enumerate(l)]\n\n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 237, "repair_prompt": ["def sort_third(l: list):\t\n'''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal and sorted to the values of the corresponding indices of l.\n>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    '''", "This function takes a list l and returns a list l' that maintains the original order of values at indices not divisible by three, but rearranges and sorts values at indices divisible by three to match the corresponding indices of l.\n>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]", "def sort_third(l: list):\t\n'''This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal and sorted to the values of the corresponding indices of l.'''\n>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 30}
