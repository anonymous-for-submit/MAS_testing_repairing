We will use sorting to simplify the process of finding the maximum product pair, which ensures high performance even for large arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'highest product'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find a pair of numbers whose product is greater than any other pair's product in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the product of the selected pair should be more than the product of any other pair in the array.\n    Implementation: Compare products of all possible pairs and select the pair with the maximum product.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'highest': This means we need to find the pair with the largest product value.\n    Implementation: Iterate through all pairs, calculate their products, and keep track of the maximum product found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Initialize variables to store the maximum product and the corresponding pair.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs in the array.\n    3. Calculate the product for each pair.\n    4. If the calculated product is greater than the current maximum product, update the maximum product and the pair.\n    5. Return the pair with the highest product.\n\n# [edge case]\n    max_Product([0, 0, 0, 0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: All elements are zero, so any pair will have a product of zero. The function should return a pair of zeros.\n    \n    max_Product([-1, -2, -3, -4]) = (-1, -2)\n    Explanation: The highest product from negative numbers is obtained by multiplying the two smallest negative numbers (closest to zero), which are -1 and -2.\n\n    max_Product([1]) = None\n    Explanation: There is only one element, so no pair can be formed. The function should handle this case appropriately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(array) < 2:\n            return None\n        max_product = float('-inf')\n        best_pair = None\n        for i in range(len(array)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):\n                product = array[i] * array[j]\n                if product > max_product:\n                    max_product = product\n                    best_pair = (array[i], array[j])\n        return best_pair\n"], "test": ["def check(max_Product):\n\tassert

This involves identifying characters in the string that match keys in the dictionary and substituting them with corresponding values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1. Validate the input to ensure it is a string and the mapping is a dictionary.\n    2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n    3. Check if the character exists in the dictionary keys.\n    4. If it does, replace it with the corresponding value from the dictionary.\n    5. Construct the new string with replaced characters.\n    6. Return the modified string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    replace_char(\"\", {'a': 'b'}) = \"\"\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters to replace, so the output remains an empty string.\n    \n    replace_char(\"abc\", {}) = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: An empty dictionary means no replacements are specified, so the original string is returned unchanged.\n    \n    replace_char(\"abc\", {'x': 'y'}) = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: The dictionary contains a mapping for a character not present in the string, so no replacements occur, and the original string is returned.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of iterating through the string and checking against dictionary keys naturally handles these scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently replace characters in a string based on a dictionary mapping. It must handle edge cases such as empty strings and non-existent characters gracefully. The solution should be intuitive and support customization.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to replace characters using a dictionary\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings\n- Optimize performance for large strings\n- Provide documentation and examples for usage\n- Allow for customization of replacement rules\nWe will implement a simple function that uses a dictionary to map characters to their replacements. The function will iterate over the input string and replace characters based on the dictionary mapping. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to ensure high performance and reliability, and handle edge cases such as empty strings and non-existent characters gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'replace characters'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to replace specific characters in a string based on a mapping provided in a dictionary.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    1.

Sort the list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple using a custom key in the sorted function.\n    2. Select the first k tuples from the sorted list.\n    3. Handle edge cases where the list is empty or k is larger than the number of tuples in the list.\n\n# [edge case]\n    min_k([], 2) = []\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no records to select, resulting in an empty list.\n    \n    min_k([('Manjeet', 10)], 2) = [('Manjeet', 10)]\n    Explanation: The list contains only one tuple, so even though k is 2, we can only return one tuple.\n    \n    min_k([('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4), ('Nikhil', 8)], 0) = []\n    Explanation: k is 0, meaning no records should be selected, resulting in an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not lst or k <= 0:\n            return []\n        elif k >= len(lst):\n            return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently find the minimum k records based on the first element of each tuple. It should handle cases where k is larger than the number of tuples and return the entire list in such cases. The function should also maintain the order of appearance for tuples with the same minimum value.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the min_k function to find minimum k records from a list of tuples.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases such as empty lists and k values larger than the list size.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for the function.\n- Include unit tests to verify the function's correctness and robustness.\nWe will implement the min_k function using Python's built-in sorted function with a custom key to sort the tuples based on the first element. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's optimized sorting algorithm. We will handle edge cases such as empty lists and k values larger than the list size by returning an empty list or the entire list, respectively. For k values that are zero or negative, the function will return an empty list, as this is a logical approach to handle such cases.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'minimum k records'\n    Explanation: This refers to selecting the smallest k number of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in the list.\n\n    'first element of the tuple'\n    Explanation: The comparison for determining the minimum is based on the first element of each tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'minimum': This indicates that we need to find the smallest values based on the first element of the tuples.\n    'k': This represents the number of smallest records to be selected.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': This indicates that we are looking for the smallest values based on the first element of the tuples.\n\n# [code logic]\n1.

The function will use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result, ensuring it handles large datasets and edge cases. We will use Python's built-in capabilities for array manipulation and avoid external libraries to keep the solution simple and focused.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'maximum sum of increasing subsequence'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the subsequence within a list that is strictly increasing and has the highest possible sum.\n\n    'prefix until ith index'\n    Explanation: This means considering elements from the start of the list up to the ith index.\n\n    'including a specified element at position k which occurs after i'\n    Explanation: This means that after considering the prefix up to the ith index, we must also include an element at position k, where k is greater than i, in the subsequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the largest possible sum of the increasing subsequence.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This means we are looking for the greatest sum possible for the increasing subsequence.\n\n# [code logic]\n1. Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[j]` will store the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `j`.\n2. Iterate over each element from index 0 to i:\n   - For each element, check all previous elements to see if they form an increasing sequence.\n   - Update `dp[j]` to be the maximum of its current value or the sum of `dp[previous_index]` and the current element if it forms an increasing sequence.\n3. After processing up to index i, consider the element at index k:\n   - Check if it can be appended to any subsequence ending before i.\n   - Update the maximum sum accordingly.\n4.

It must handle edge cases, such as empty lists, by returning a ratio of zero. The implementation should be straightforward and well-documented to ensure ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to calculate the ratio of positive numbers.\n- Ensure the function returns zero for empty arrays.\n- Document the function for clarity and ease of use.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large datasets.\n- Include unit tests to verify function accuracy.\nWe will implement a simple function using Python's built-in capabilities to calculate the ratio of positive numbers in a list. The function will handle empty lists by returning a ratio of zero. This approach ensures ease of use and avoids unnecessary complexity from external libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'positive numbers'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it refers to numbers greater than zero.\n\n    'ratio'\n    Explanation: The ratio is the fraction of positive numbers compared to the total number of elements in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'ratio of positive numbers': This means the number of positive numbers divided by the total number of elements in the array.

Create a list with the number of days for each month, where the index corresponds to the month number (e.g., index 0 for January, index 1 for February).\n    2. Check if the input month number is valid (between 1 and 12).\n    3. If valid, check if the number of days for that month is 30.\n    4. Return True if the month has 30 days, otherwise return False.\n    5. Handle invalid inputs by returning an error message or False.\n\n# [edge case]\n    check_monthnumber_number(0) = False\n    Explanation: Month number 0 is invalid, so the function should return False or handle it as an error.\n    \n    check_monthnumber_number(13) = False\n    Explanation: Month number 13 is invalid, so the function should return False or handle it as an error.\n    \n    check_monthnumber_number(4) = True\n    Explanation: April (month number 4) has 30 days, so the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        def check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n            days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\n            if month_number < 1 or month_number > 12:\n                return False\n            return days_in_month[month_number - 1] == 30\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately determine if a month has 30 days based on its number.
