- Ensure compatibility with different data types
We will use Python's built-in set data structure to efficiently remove duplicates and then sort the list using the sorted() function. This approach leverages the efficiency of set operations for uniqueness and the optimized sorting algorithm provided by Python, ensuring performance even with large lists.


requirement analysis:
The function should take a list as input, remove duplicates, and return a sorted list of unique elements. It should be efficient enough to handle large datasets without significant performance degradation.
requirement pool:
- Implement the function to return unique elements.
- Ensure the output is sorted in ascending order.
- Optimize the function for performance with large lists.
- Add error handling for non-list inputs.
- Include documentation and examples for usage.
We will use Python's built-in set to remove duplicates and then sort the resulting set to ensure the elements are in ascending order. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's optimized internal algorithms for handling large datasets.
