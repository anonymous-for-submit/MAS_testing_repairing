We will implement a function named `colon_tuplex` that takes a tuple, an index, and a value as inputs. The function will return a new tuple with the value inserted at the specified index. If the index is out of bounds, the value will be appended to the list within the tuple. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle tuples and lists, ensuring compatibility with Python 3.x.

We will implement a function named `colon_tuplex` that takes a tuple, an index, and a value as inputs. The function will check if the element at the specified index is a list. If it is, the function will insert the value into the list at the specified index. If the index is out of bounds, the function will append the value to the list. If the element at the specified index is not a list, the function will return the tuple unchanged. This approach ensures that the function handles edge cases gracefully and maintains the immutability of tuples by returning a new tuple.
