    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Your task will be to effectively assess each digit in the given string for its primality status.
Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.

    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term, and if the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
