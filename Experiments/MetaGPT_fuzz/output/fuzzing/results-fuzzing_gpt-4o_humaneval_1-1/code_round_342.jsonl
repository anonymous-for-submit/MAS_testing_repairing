It must return a new list without altering the original list, ensuring efficiency and clarity in its operation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must not modify the original list\n- Sort elements at indices divisible by three\n- Handle large lists efficiently\n- Provide clear documentation\n- Include examples for better understanding\nWe will implement a function that creates a new list by iterating over the original list and sorting only the elements at indices divisible by three. The original list will remain unmodified. We will use Python's built-in sorted function to handle the sorting of these specific elements, ensuring efficiency and clarity. The function will be documented with examples to illustrate its usage.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [132, 132, 132, 132, 132, 132, 132, 132, 132, 132], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sort_third(l: list) -> list:\n    '''\n    This function takes a list l and returns a new list where elements at indices divisible by three are sorted, \n    while other elements remain unchanged.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    l (list): The input list of elements.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A new list with elements at indices divisible by three sorted.\n    \n    Examples:\n    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    '''\n    # Create a copy of the original list to avoid modifying it\n    result = l[:]\n    \n    # Extract elements at indices divisible by three\n    elements_to_sort = [result[i] for i in range(len(result)) if i % 3 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort the extracted elements\n    sorted_elements = sorted(elements_to_sort)\n    \n    # Place the sorted elements back into their original positions\n    for index, sorted_value in zip(range(0, len(result), 3), sorted_elements):\n        result[index] = sorted_value\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n    print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    print(sort_third([]))  # Output: []\n    print(sort_third([1, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 342, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 30}
