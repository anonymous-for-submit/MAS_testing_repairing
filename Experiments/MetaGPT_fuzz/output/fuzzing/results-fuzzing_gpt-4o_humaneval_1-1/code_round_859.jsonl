The two lists are called lst1 and lst2. The goal is to transform lst1 into a list where every number is even. There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be
