The emotions and thoughts you experience at that moment are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. Two arrays of equal length are provided to you with scores and guesses, where each index represents a match. Return an array of the same length indicating the deviation of each guess from the actual score. If their guess was accurate, the value is 0, but if not, it is the absolute difference between the predicted and actual scores.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->
