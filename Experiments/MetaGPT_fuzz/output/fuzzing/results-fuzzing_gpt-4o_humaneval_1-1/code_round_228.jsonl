This approach ensures that we only process necessary parts of the string, optimizing performance. We will handle edge cases such as empty strings by returning 0 immediately. The function will be documented with examples and edge case handling. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without additional libraries to keep the implementation simple and efficient.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_upper(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of uppercase vowels located at even indices in the string.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be processed.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The count of uppercase vowels at even indices.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> count_upper('aBCdEf')\n    1\n    >>> count_upper('abcdefg')\n    0\n    >>> count_upper('dBBE')\n    0\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize count to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Define uppercase vowels\n    uppercase_vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    \n    # Iterate over the string, checking characters at even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase vowel\n        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:\n            # Increment count if it is an uppercase vowel\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the final count\n    return count\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 228, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 82}
