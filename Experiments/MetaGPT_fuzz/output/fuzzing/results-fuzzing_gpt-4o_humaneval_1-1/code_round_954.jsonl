It should handle edge cases such as lists with all odd or all even numbers and provide a clear 'YES' or 'NO' output.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must correctly identify if lst1 can be transformed into all even numbers\n- The function should handle large lists efficiently\n- The function should provide clear documentation and examples\n- The function should handle invalid inputs gracefully\n- The function should be compatible with Python 3.x\nWe will use built-in Python functions to efficiently check if lst1 can be transformed into a list of even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2. The function will iterate through lst1 to identify odd numbers and check if lst2 contains enough even numbers to replace them. This approach ensures compatibility with Python 3.x and handles large lists efficiently without requiring additional libraries.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9248, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 123, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef exchange(lst1: list[int], lst2: list[int]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if lst1 can be transformed into a list of even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2.\n\n    Parameters:\n    lst1 (list[int]): The first list of numbers.\n    lst2 (list[int]): The second list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: 'YES' if lst1 can be transformed into all even numbers, otherwise 'NO'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1\n    odd_count = sum(1 for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0)\n    \n    # Count the number of even numbers in lst2\n    even_count = sum(1 for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0)\n    \n    # Determine if lst1 can be transformed into all even numbers\n    if even_count >= odd_count:\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 954, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 93}
