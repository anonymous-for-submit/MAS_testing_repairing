We will use memoization to store previously computed values to further optimize performance.\n"], "scores": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0667, 0.1, 0.0667, 0.0667, 0.0667, 0.1, 0.0667], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef fibfib(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the n-th element of the FibFib sequence.\n    \n    The FibFib sequence is defined as follows:\n    - FibFib(0) = 0\n    - FibFib(1) = 1\n    - FibFib(n) = FibFib(n-1) + FibFib(n-2) + FibFib(n-3) for n >= 2\n    \n    This function uses an iterative approach with memoization to efficiently compute\n    the sequence for large values of n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n: The index of the sequence element to compute.\n        \n    Returns:\n        The n-th element of the FibFib sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Memoization array to store previously computed values\n    memo = [0] * (n + 1)\n    memo[0], memo[1], memo[2] = 0, 1, 1\n    \n    # Iteratively compute the sequence using memoization\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2] + memo[i - 3]\n    \n    return memo[n]\n", "passed": false, "pass": false, "pass_num": 0, "round": 54, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 54}
