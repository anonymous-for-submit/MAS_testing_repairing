It should handle various input sizes and edge cases, such as lists with no even numbers or all even numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function logic\n- Optimize for performance with large lists\n- Include comprehensive test cases\n- Provide detailed documentation\n- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x\nWe will implement a function that iterates through lst1 to check if all elements are even. If any element is odd, we will check if there is an even number in lst2 that can replace it. The function will return 'YES' if all elements in lst1 can be made even, otherwise 'NO'. We will use built-in Python list operations to keep the implementation simple and efficient.\n"], "scores": [0.782, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.782, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [104, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 104, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef exchange(lst1: list[int], lst2: list[int]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if it's possible to make all elements in lst1 even by exchanging elements with lst2.\n\n    Parameters:\n    lst1 (list[int]): The first list of integers.\n    lst2 (list[int]): The second list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: 'YES' if all elements in lst1 can be made even, otherwise 'NO'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count the number of odd elements in lst1\n    odd_count_lst1 = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)\n    \n    # Count the number of even elements in lst2\n    even_count_lst2 = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)\n    \n    # If the number of odd elements in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even elements in lst2,\n    # it is possible to replace all odd elements in lst1 with even elements from lst2\n    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2:\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 372, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 93}
