This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of making the first list entirely even. We will use Python's built-in functions to maintain simplicity and performance.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should efficiently determine if all elements in lst1 can be made even by exchanging elements with lst2.
