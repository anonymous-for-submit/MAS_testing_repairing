It must handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without vowels, ensuring robustness and reliability.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count uppercase vowels at even indices.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large input strings.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings.\n- Add comprehensive test cases to validate functionality.\n- Document the function usage and edge case handling.\nWe will implement a standalone Python function that iterates over the string, checking only even indices for uppercase vowels. This approach avoids unnecessary complexity and dependencies, ensuring optimal performance even for large strings. We will handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without vowels by returning zero in these scenarios.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_upper(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be processed.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The count of uppercase vowels at even indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the set of uppercase vowels\n    uppercase_vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    \n    # Initialize the count of uppercase vowels at even indices\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string, checking only even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 368, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 82}
