The implementation should prioritize performance and accuracy.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count uppercase vowels at even indices.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large input strings.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.\n- Include unit tests to verify function accuracy.\nWe will implement a function that iterates over the string, checking each character at even indices to determine if it is an uppercase vowel. The function will be optimized for performance by using efficient string traversal techniques and will handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without uppercase vowels. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to achieve this without the need for external libraries.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_upper(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string.\n\n    This function iterates over the input string, checking each character at even indices\n    to determine if it is an uppercase vowel.
