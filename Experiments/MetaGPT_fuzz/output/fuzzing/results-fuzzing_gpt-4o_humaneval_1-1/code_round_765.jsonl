The implementation should be efficient to handle large strings.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main function to count uppercase vowels at even indices.\n- Ensure the function handles empty strings and strings without vowels.\n- Optimize the function for performance with large input strings.\n- Add comprehensive test cases for various input scenarios.\n- Document the function usage and edge cases.\nWe will implement a standalone Python function that iterates over the string, checking only even indices for uppercase vowels. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in string methods, ensuring simplicity and performance. We will handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without vowels by returning zero in these scenarios.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_upper(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the input string.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string to be processed.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The count of uppercase vowels at even indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the set of uppercase vowels\n    uppercase_vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    \n    # Initialize the count of uppercase vowels\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string, checking only even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        # Check if the character at the current even index is an uppercase vowel\n        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:\n            # Increment the count if it is an uppercase vowel\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the final count of uppercase vowels at even indices\n    return count\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 765, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 82}
