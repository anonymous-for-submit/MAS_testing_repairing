the shell sort algorithm.\n    \n    The shell sort algorithm is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.\n    The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other and progressively reduces the gap between elements\n    to be compared. This approach helps in reducing the number of swaps needed, thus improving efficiency.\n\n    Args:\n        arr: List of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        Sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the gap using the Knuth sequence\n    n = len(arr)\n    gap = 1\n    while gap < n // 3:\n        gap = 3 * gap + 1  # Increment sequence: 1, 4, 13, 40, ...\n\n    # Perform the shell sort\n    while gap > 0:\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            temp = arr[i]\n            j = i\n            # Perform insertion sort with the current gap\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            arr[j] = temp\n        gap //= 3  # Reduce the gap\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_list = [12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]\n    sorted_list = shell_sort(example_list)\n    print(sorted_list)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 805, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 158}
