The function will include detailed comments explaining each step of the calculation to enhance understanding. We will use the formula for the surface area of a regular tetrahedron: A = sqrt(3) * a^2, where 'a' is the length of a side. The function will be simple and easy to integrate into other projects.\n"], "test": ["def check(area_tetrahedron):\n\tassert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894", "def
