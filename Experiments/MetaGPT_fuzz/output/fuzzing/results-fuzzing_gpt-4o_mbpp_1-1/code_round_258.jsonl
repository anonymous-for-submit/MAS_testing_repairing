It should be efficient and easy to understand, with clear documentation provided.\nrequirement pool:\n- Accurate counting of nested lists\n- Performance optimization for large datasets\n- Clear documentation and examples\n- User-friendly error handling\n- Compatibility with different Python versions\nWe will implement a recursive function to count the number of lists, including nested lists, within a given list structure. This approach ensures that all levels of nested lists are accurately counted. We will use Python's built-in capabilities without relying on external libraries to keep the solution simple and efficient.\n"], "test": ["def check(count_list):\n\tassert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7],
