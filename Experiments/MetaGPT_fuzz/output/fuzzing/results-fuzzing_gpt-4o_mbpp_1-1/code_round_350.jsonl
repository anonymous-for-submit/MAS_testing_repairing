This approach is both efficient and readable. We will handle empty sublists by skipping them, as this aligns with typical Pythonic practices and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should iterate over each sublist, check if it is non-empty, and extract the first element. It should handle empty sublists by skipping them and ensure the overall process is efficient. Edge cases such as lists with only empty sublists or very large lists should be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function must handle empty sublists without errors.\n- The function should efficiently extract the first element from each sublist.\n- The function should be well-documented for ease of use.\n- The function should maintain high readability and simplicity.\n- The function should be tested with various edge cases.\nWe will implement a simple Python function using list comprehension to efficiently extract the first element from each sublist. The function will handle empty sublists by skipping them, ensuring robustness and efficiency. We will not use any external libraries as the task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled with built-in Python capabilities.\n"], "test": ["def check(Extract):\n\tassert Extract([[1, 2],
