{"name": "1615_A. Closing The Gap", "description": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. \n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3. The new heights will now be [2, 2, 2, 2], with an ugliness of 0.\n\nIn the third test case, you may do three operations: \n\n  1. with i = 3 and j = 1. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 1, 5], \n  2. with i = 5 and j = 4. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 2, 4], \n  3. with i = 5 and j = 3. The new array will now be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nThe resulting ugliness is 1. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1615, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1

The key observation is that the minimum ugliness is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum heights after redistributing the blocks evenly. The sum of the heights remains constant, so the minimum ugliness is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the total number of blocks is divisible by the number of towers.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe task is to minimize the difference between the tallest and shortest towers by redistributing blocks. The solution should efficiently handle up to 1000 test cases with up to 100 towers each, where tower heights can be very large.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to calculate minimum ugliness.\n- Optimize the solution for large input sizes.\n- Ensure the solution is responsive and works on various devices.\n- Provide a user-friendly input and output interface.\n- Include detailed comments and documentation for the code.\nWe will calculate the total number of blocks and then determine the average height each tower should have to minimize the ugliness. The minimum possible ugliness is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum heights after redistributing the blocks as evenly as possible. This can be achieved by calculating the ceiling of the average height and the floor of the average height, and then determining the difference between these two values.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, true, false, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 189, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.
