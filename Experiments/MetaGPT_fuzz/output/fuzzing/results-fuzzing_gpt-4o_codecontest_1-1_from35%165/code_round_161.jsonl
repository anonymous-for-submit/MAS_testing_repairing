{"name": "1615_A. Closing The Gap", "description": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. \n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3. The new heights will now be [2, 2, 2, 2], with an ugliness of 0.\n\nIn the third test case, you may do three operations: \n\n  1. with i = 3 and j = 1. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 1, 5], \n  2. with i = 5 and j = 4. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 2, 4], \n  3. with i = 5 and j = 3. The new array will now be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nThe resulting ugliness is 1. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1615, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1

The key insight is that the minimum ugliness is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum heights after redistributing blocks to equalize the heights as much as possible. We will use Python's built-in functions to efficiently compute the sum and average of the heights, and then determine the minimum and maximum possible heights after redistribution.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires determining the minimum possible difference between the tallest and shortest buildings after redistributing blocks. The solution should efficiently handle up to 1000 test cases with up to 100 buildings each, where each building height can be as large as 10^7.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the main algorithm to calculate minimum ugliness.\n- Optimize the solution for large input sizes.\n- Ensure the solution is easy to understand and maintain.\n- Provide detailed comments and documentation.\n- Consider edge cases and validate input data.\nWe will calculate the minimum possible ugliness by redistributing the blocks such that the difference between the maximum and minimum heights is minimized. The key observation is that the minimum ugliness is achieved when the difference between the maximum and minimum heights is at most 1. This can be achieved by ensuring that the total number of blocks is evenly distributed among the towers or as evenly as possible.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe task requires calculating the minimum possible ugliness of building heights after redistributing blocks.

The key observation is that the minimum possible ugliness is determined by the difference between the ceiling and floor of the average height of the towers. This is because redistributing blocks to make all towers as close to the average height as possible minimizes the height difference.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, false, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 161, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.
