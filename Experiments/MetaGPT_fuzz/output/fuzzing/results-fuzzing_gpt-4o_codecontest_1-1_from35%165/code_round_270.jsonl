{"name": "1615_B. And It's Non-Zero", "description": "You are given an array consisting of all integers from [l, r] inclusive. For example, if l = 2 and r = 5, the array would be [2, 3, 4, 5]. What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of the array non-zero?\n\nA bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the description of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 2\n2 8\n4 5\n1 5\n100000 200000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n3\n0\n2\n31072\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array is [1, 2]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0, as 1\\ \\& \\ 2 = 0. However, after deleting 1 (or 2), the array becomes [2] (or [1]), and the bitwise AND becomes 2 (or 1). This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second test case, the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Currently, the bitwise AND is 0. However, after deleting 4, 5, and 8, the array becomes [2, 3, 6, 7], and the bitwise AND becomes 2. This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is 3.
