{"name": "1600_J. Robot Factory", "description": "You have received data from a Bubble bot. You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct. \n\nYour task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.

The solution must efficiently handle large grids up to 1000x1000 tiles.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently parse and process the input grid data.\n- Accurately determine room boundaries and sizes.\n- Sort room sizes in descending order for output.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases and large inputs robustly.\n- Optimize for performance to handle maximum input sizes.\nWe will use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the grid and identify distinct rooms. Each tile's binary representation will be used to determine wall presence and guide the DFS traversal. The solution will efficiently handle large grids by using a visited matrix to track explored tiles and avoid redundant calculations.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 47, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.
