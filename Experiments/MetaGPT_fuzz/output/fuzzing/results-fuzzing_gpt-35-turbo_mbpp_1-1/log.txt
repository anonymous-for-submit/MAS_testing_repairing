### Description
Construct a Python function to determine the least number of rotations needed to obtain an identical string. The number of rotations should exceed 0. Consider all cyclic permutations of the string to identify the identical configuration.

### Input
- A non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.

### Output
- An integer representing the minimum number of rotations needed such that the string becomes identical to the original configuration.

### Example
```python
# Example 1
input_string = "abcde"
output = 5 # Explanation: rotating each character results in original configuration after 5 rotations.

# Example 2
input_string = "aaaa"
output = 1 # Explanation: any rotation results in the identical string.

# Example 3
input_string = "abab"
output = 2 # Explanation: rotating by 2 positions gives the identical string.

# Example 4
input_string = "abcabc"
output = 3 # Explanation: rotating by 3 positions gives the identical string.
```

### Constraints
- The length of the input string will be between 1 and 1000.
