The output should reflect the final state of the array after all queries have been executed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle up to 500,000 queries\n- Correctly implement both add and replace operations\n- Optimize for time complexity\n- Ensure memory usage is within acceptable limits\n- Provide detailed documentation and examples\nWe will use a list to store the elements of the array and handle the queries efficiently. For the '1 x' query, we will append the element x to the list. For the '2 x y' query, we will iterate over the list and replace all occurrences of x with y. Given the constraints, this approach will efficiently handle up to 500,000 queries. We will ensure that the operations are performed optimally by leveraging Python's list operations.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to handle a sequence of queries on an integer array efficiently.
