{"name": "1615_A. Closing The Gap", "description": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. \n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3. The new heights will now be [2, 2, 2, 2], with an ugliness of 0.\n\nIn the third test case, you may do three operations: \n\n  1. with i = 3 and j = 1. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 1, 5], \n  2. with i = 5 and j = 4. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 2, 4], \n  3. with i = 5 and j = 3. The new array will now be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nThe resulting ugliness is 1. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1615, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1
