{"name": "1615_A. Closing The Gap", "description": "There are n block towers in a row, where tower i has a height of a_i. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. \n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3. The new heights will now be [2, 2, 2, 2], with an ugliness of 0.\n\nIn the third test case, you may do three operations: \n\n  1. with i = 3 and j = 1. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 1, 5], \n  2. with i = 5 and j = 4. The new array will now be [2, 2, 2, 2, 4], \n  3. with i = 5 and j = 3. The new array will now be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nThe resulting ugliness is 1. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.", "tags": ["greedy", "math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1615, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1

The key observation is that the minimum ugliness is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum heights after redistributing the blocks to make the heights as equal as possible. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this by calculating the total number of blocks and distributing them evenly across the towers.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe task requires developing an algorithm that can efficiently redistribute blocks between towers to minimize the height difference. The solution must handle up to 1000 test cases, each with up to 100 buildings, and heights as large as 10^7. The primary challenge is to ensure the algorithm is both optimal and efficient.\nrequirement pool:\n- Develop an algorithm to minimize the height difference between towers.\n- Ensure the solution can handle up to 1000 test cases efficiently.\n- Provide a clear explanation of the operations needed to achieve the result.\n- Optimize the algorithm for large input sizes.\n- Include detailed comments and documentation in the code.\nWe will implement a function that calculates the minimum possible ugliness by redistributing blocks between towers. The key idea is to balance the heights by moving blocks from taller towers to shorter ones until the difference between the tallest and shortest tower is minimized. We will use Python's built-in functions to efficiently find the maximum and minimum heights and adjust them accordingly.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 987, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.
