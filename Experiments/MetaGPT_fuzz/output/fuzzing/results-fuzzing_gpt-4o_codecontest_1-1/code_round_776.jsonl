{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with each test case having up to 100 days. Edge cases, such as consecutive days without watering leading to the flower's death, must be accounted for. The output must be consistent with the specified format.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently calculate the flower's height after n days\n- Handle edge cases where the flower may die early\n- Ensure the solution is robust against large constraints\n- Provide clear and consistent output formatting\n- Optimize for performance across multiple test cases\nWe will implement a function that iterates through each test case, simulating the growth of the flower based on the watering pattern provided. The function will track the height of the flower and check for consecutive days without watering to determine if the flower dies. The solution will efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with each test case having up to 100 days, ensuring edge cases are properly managed.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on simulating the growth of a flower based on watering patterns over n days. The solution must efficiently handle multiple test cases and edge cases, such as consecutive days without watering leading to the flower's death. The output should clearly indicate the flower's height or if it has died.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle multiple test cases.\n- Accurately track flower growth and death conditions.\n- Provide clear output for each test case.\n- Handle edge cases where n is very small.\n- Optimize for large constraints within given limits.\nWe will implement a function that simulates the growth of a flower over n days based on the watering pattern provided. The function will iterate through each day, updating the flower's height according to the rules specified. If the flower is not watered for two consecutive days, it will die, and the function will return -1 for that test case. We will use simple list operations to track the watering pattern and calculate the height efficiently. The solution will handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 776, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
