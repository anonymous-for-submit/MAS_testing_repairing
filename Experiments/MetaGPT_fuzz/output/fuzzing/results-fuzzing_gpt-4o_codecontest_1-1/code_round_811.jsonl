{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The function will handle edge cases such as the flower dying early due to consecutive days without watering.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements focus on determining the final height of a flower based on watering patterns over n days. The solution must efficiently handle up to 100 test cases with each test case having up to 100 days. Edge cases include scenarios where the flower dies early due to consecutive days without watering. The solution should be robust and provide accurate results for all possible input scenarios.\nrequirement pool:\n- Efficiently handle up to 100 test cases\n- Accurately determine flower height or death\n- Handle edge cases where n is very small\n- Provide clear and understandable output\n- Optimize for performance with large constraints\nWe will implement a function that iterates through the watering pattern for each test case, updating the flower's height based on the rules provided. We will use a simple loop to check for consecutive days without watering, which will result in the flower dying. The function will handle multiple test cases efficiently by processing each one independently.
