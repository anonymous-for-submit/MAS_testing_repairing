Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1.

Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8].

The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "pass@10": true, "passes": 2}

If a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisey can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array and, if there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them; then the selected minimal element is removed from the array, and afterwards, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible. Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1. Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.

Instead, it enables you to extract a portion of the array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset, and place it back into the same position.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may choose arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you substitute the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by any chosen offset d. Moreover, the idea of a cyclic shift can be further clarified with these relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8].

If the array\u2019s length is strictly more than one, Yelisey can perform an operation named minimum extraction: Initially, Yelisei identifies the smallest number m in the array, and if there are multiple identical minimum values, Yelisey can opt for any one of them; subsequently, the chosen smallest element is eliminated from the array, and then m is deducted from every other remaining element. Thus, following each operation, the array's length diminishes by one. For instance, given a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], the minimum element in this array is a_3 = -4, signifying that post-operation, the array will become a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey has a preference for large numbers, he desires the numbers in array 'a' to be as large as feasible. More precisely, he aims to maximize the lowest number in array 'a' (that is, he wants the minimum to be as large as it can be). In pursuit of this goal, Yelisey can carry out the minimum extraction operation on the array any number of times he wishes (possibly none at all).

Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].

If a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisey can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array and, if there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them; then the selected minimal element is removed from the array, and afterwards, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible. Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1. Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.

If a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisey can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array and, if there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them; then the selected minimal element is removed from the array, and afterwards, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after every operation, the length of the array is diminished by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.

{"task_id": "codecontest/14", "prompt": "The latest external memory design contains a sequence of numbers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n]. This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element, instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: 1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. 2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. For example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8].

Additionally, both groups must have an equal count of students.\n\nEvery student has completed a survey indicating which weekdays they prefer for attending a lesson. They have also indicated which weekdays they do not prefer for attending a lesson. The preference data collected from the students plays a crucial role in determining the days for the lessons.\n\nYour task is to establish if it is feasible to select two distinct weekdays for scheduling lessons for the groups (the first group will attend the lesson on the first selected day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second selected day), and organize the students into two groups so that the groups have equal sizes, and the appointed lesson day for their group suits every student. Examine all potential day combinations to ensure the solution accommodates various scenarios. Consider edge cases such as when all students have the same preferences or when preferences vary greatly. Utilize efficient algorithms to handle scenarios with large numbers of students and rapid preference evaluation. Ensure your solution is optimized for performance to handle up to thousands of student preferences efficiently. This problem requires you to think about time complexity to ensure that the program runs efficiently even with the upper constraint of input size.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of t testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains 5 integers, each of them is 0 or 1.

If the array\u2019s size is greater than one, Yelisey can execute an operation called minimum extraction: Initially, Yelisei identifies the smallest number m in the array, and if there are multiple identical minimum values, Yelisey can opt for any one of them; subsequently, the chosen smallest element is eliminated from the array, and then m is deducted from every other remaining element. Thus, following each operation, the array's length diminishes by one. For instance, given a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], the minimum element in this array is a_3 = -4, signifying that post-operation, the array will become a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey has a preference for large numbers, he desires the numbers in array 'a' to be as large as feasible. More precisely, he aims to maximize the lowest number in array 'a' (that is, he wants the minimum to be as large as it can be). In pursuit of this goal, Yelisey can carry out the minimum extraction operation on the array any number of times he wishes (possibly none at all). Bear in mind that the operation cannot be conducted on an array with length equal to one. Assist him in determining what maximum value the array's minimal element can achieve after performing several (possibly zero) minimum extraction operations.

If the array\u2019s size is greater than one, Yelisey can execute an operation called minimum extraction: Initially, Yelisei identifies the smallest number m in the array, and if there are multiple identical minimum values, Yelisey can opt for any one of them; subsequently, the chosen smallest element is eliminated from the array, and then m is deducted from every other remaining element. Thus, following each operation, the array's length diminishes by one. For instance, given a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], the minimum element in this array is a_3 = -4, signifying that post-operation, the array will become a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey has a preference for large numbers, he desires the numbers in array 'a' to be as large as feasible.

In pursuit of this goal, Yelisey can carry out the minimum extraction operation on the array any number of times he wishes (possibly none at all). Bear in mind that the operation cannot be conducted on an array with length equal to one.

To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!

{"task_id": "codecontest/100", "prompt": "Yelisey possesses an array, denoted as 'a,' comprising n integers. If the array\u2019s length is strictly more than one, Yelisey can perform an operation named minimum extraction: Initially, Yelisei identifies the smallest number m in the array; if there are multiple identical minimum values, Yelisey can opt for any one of them, subsequently, the chosen smallest element is eliminated from the array, and then m is deducted from every other remaining element. Thus, following each operation, the array's length diminishes by one. For instance, given a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], the minimum element in this array is a_3 = -4, signifying that post-operation, the array will become a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey has a preference for large numbers, he desires the numbers in array 'a' to be as large as feasible, aiming to maximize the lowest number in array 'a' (that is, he wants the minimum to be as large as it can be). In pursuit of this goal, Yelisey can carry out the minimum extraction operation on the array any number of times he wishes (possibly none at all). Bear in mind that the operation cannot be conducted on an array with length equal to one. Assist him in determining what maximum value the array's minimal element can achieve after performing several (possibly zero) minimum extraction operations.

If a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisey can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array and, if there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them; then the selected minimal element is removed from the array, and afterwards, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible. Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1. Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.

Thus, following each operation, the array's length diminishes by one. For instance, given a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], the minimum element in this array is a_3 = -4, signifying that post-operation, the array will become a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].

Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible, and formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1.

The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate, and traveling from the x-th room to the y-th room requires a tunnel between x and y; it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy to travel between these two rooms, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries about potential changes.

{"task_id": "codecontest/100", "prompt": "Yelisey has an array a of n integers. If a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisey can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array and, if there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them; then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible, and formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1. Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.

It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.

{"task_id": "codecontest/8", "prompt": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.\n\nThe map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n. There are n - 1 tunnels connecting them such that it is feasible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.\n\nThe i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate. To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy. |z| denotes the absolute value of z.\n\nTo prevent grave robbers, the maze can alter the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). \n\nHelp them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!
