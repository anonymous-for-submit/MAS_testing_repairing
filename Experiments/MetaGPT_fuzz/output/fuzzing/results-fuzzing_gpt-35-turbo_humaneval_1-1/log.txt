The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers, and it may contain duplicates. The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you should return the list sorted by that rule. If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically. The function should return a list of strings in sorted order, and you may assume that all words will have the same length.
For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]

'''You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists. This is similar to a matrix. However, unlike matrices, each row may contain a different number of columns. Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0. Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],

The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers, and it may contain duplicates. The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you should return the list sorted by that rule. If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically. The function should return a list of strings in sorted order. You may assume that all words will have identical character counts per string. That character count will be the same for all words in the list.
For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]

'''I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited event is finally known. When the result is finally unveiled, all the anticipation culminates in a unique experience. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]

Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list. Ensure that the function handles cases where the list is empty, and include an optional separator that defaults to an empty string between each concatenated string. Consider edge cases where the input might consist of non-string elements or contain special characters.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n.

If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
