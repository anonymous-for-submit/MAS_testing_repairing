1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses Python's set operations to find shared elements between two lists, which is efficient and straightforward.
2. Yes, the code logic is completely correct. It correctly converts the lists to sets, finds their intersection, and returns the result as a list.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described. It uses the specified function signature and handles input/output as expected.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `find_shared_elements` function is implemented and used correctly in the `main` function.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `List` type from the `typing` module is used correctly.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as this is a standalone script.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It sorts the indices of book titles based on the custom sorting criteria specified: odd indices in ascending order and even indices in descending order.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. The custom sorting key is implemented properly, and the sorting is done using Python's built-in `sorted` function with a lambda function to apply the custom key.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described. The function signature and input/output interfaces are consistent with the provided design.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `sort_books_asc_desc` function is implemented and used correctly.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `List` type from the `typing` module is used correctly.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not applicable here as the code is self-contained within a single file.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

2025-04-23 16:43:36.856 | INFO     | metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:92 - New requirement detected: Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Define b as the cyclic sequence obtained from concatenating m copies of a. Note that b has size n ⋅ m.

You are given an integer k where k = 1 or k is a prime number. Find the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k.

Two segments are considered different if the set of indices of the segments are different. For example, when n = 3 and m = 2, the set of indices for segment s[2, 5] is \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, and for segment s[5, 2] is \{5, 6, 1, 2\}. In particular, the segments s[1, 6], s[2,1], …, s[6, 5] are considered as the same segment.

Output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, k = 1 or k is a prime number).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

Output an integer denoting the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Define f(u, v) as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour (u, v), which is a simple path that starts at the u-th attraction and ends at the v-th attraction. Find the sum of f(u,v) for all valid tours (u, v) (1 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ n) that does not need more than k tickets, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1) — the number of attractions in the city park and the number of tickets you have.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,…, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the happiness value of each attraction.

The i-th of the next n - 1 lines contains three integers u_i, v_i, and t_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, 0 ≤ t_i ≤ 1) — an edge between vertices u_i and v_i with color t_i. The given edges form a tree.

Output

Output an integer denoting the total happiness value for all valid tours (u, v) (1 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ n), modulo 10^9 + 7.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

The strings are pairwise distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

This code defines a function `sort_books_asc_desc` that sorts a list of book titles based on a custom sorting order. The function uses a custom key for sorting, which considers characters at odd indices in ascending order and characters at even indices in descending order. The main block handles input and output, ensuring the function is called with the correct parameters and the result is printed in the required format.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

2025-04-23 16:47:12.215 | INFO     | metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:92 - New requirement detected: Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

2025-04-23 16:47:12.403 | INFO     | metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:92 - New requirement detected: Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.
