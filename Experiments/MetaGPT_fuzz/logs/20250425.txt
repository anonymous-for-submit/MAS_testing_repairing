2025-04-25 21:10:31.769 | INFO     | metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:92 - New requirement detected: Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

2025-04-25 21:13:08.115 | INFO     | metagpt.actions.write_prd:run:92 - New requirement detected: Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

-------
Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Define b as the cyclic sequence obtained from concatenating m copies of a. Note that b has size n ⋅ m.

You are given an integer k where k = 1 or k is a prime number. Find the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k.

Two segments are considered different if the set of indices of the segments are different. For example, when n = 3 and m = 2, the set of indices for segment s[2, 5] is \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, and for segment s[5, 2] is \{5, 6, 1, 2\}. In particular, the segments s[1, 6], s[2,1], …, s[6, 5] are considered as the same segment.

Output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, k = 1 or k is a prime number).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

## Explanation:
- **Function `sort_books`**: This function sorts the book titles based on the custom asc-desc-ending order. It uses a custom comparator function to determine the order of two book titles.
- **Custom Comparator**: The comparator checks each character of the book titles. If the index is odd, it sorts in ascending order; if even, it sorts in descending order.
- **Sorting**: The indices of the books are sorted using Python's built-in sort function with a custom key function that applies the comparator.
- **Main Function**: Handles input and output, reading from standard input and printing the sorted indices.

1. No, the code does not implement the sorting logic correctly. The `sort` method does not support a `cmp` argument in Python 3. Instead, a custom key function should be used to achieve the desired sorting order. The `custom_comparator` function should be used within a key function to sort the indices based on the book titles.
2. No, the code logic is incorrect due to the use of `cmp` in the `sort` method. To correct this, we need to implement a custom key function that uses the `custom_comparator` logic to generate a sort key for each book title.
3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as this is a standalone script.

## Actions
1. Fix the sorting logic by using a custom key function instead of `cmp` in the `sort` method. Implement a function to generate a sort key based on the `custom_comparator` logic.

No, the code does not implement the sorting logic correctly. The `sort` method does not support a `cmp` argument in Python 3. Instead, a custom key function should be used to achieve the desired sorting order. The `custom_comparator` function should be used within a key function to sort the indices based on the book titles.\n2. No, the code logic is incorrect due to the use of `cmp` in the `sort` method. To correct this, we need to implement a custom key function that uses the `custom_comparator` logic to generate a sort key for each book title.\n3. Yes, the code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as this is a standalone script.\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix the sorting logic by using a custom key function instead of `cmp` in the `sort` method. Implement a function to generate a sort key based on the `custom_comparator` logic.\n   ```python\n   def sort_books(n: int, m: int, books: List[str]) -> List[int]:\n       """Sorts book titles based on asc-desc-ending order.\n\n       Args:\n           n (int): Number of books.\n           m (int): Length of each book title.\n           books (List[str]): List of book titles.\n\n       Returns:\n           List[int]: Sorted indices of the book titles.\n       """\n       def custom_key(book: str) -> List[int]:\n           """Generates a sort key for a book title based on asc-desc-ending order.\n\n           Args:\n               book (str): Book title.\n\n           Returns:\n               List[int]: Sort key for the book title.\n           """\n           return [ord(book[i]) if i % 2 == 1 else -ord(book[i]) for i in range(m)]\n\n       # Create a list of indices\n       indices = list(range(n))\n       \n       # Sort indices based on the custom key applied to the book titles\n       indices.sort(key=lambda idx: custom_key(books[idx]))\n       \n       return indices\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite the `main.py` based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

### Explanation:
- **Custom Key Function**: The `custom_key` function generates a list of integers representing the sort key for each book title. For odd indices, it uses the ASCII value of the character directly (ascending order), and for even indices, it uses the negative ASCII value (descending order).
- **Sorting**: The `indices` list is sorted using the `sort` method with a custom key function that applies the `custom_key` logic to each book title.
- **Main Function**: Handles input and output, reading from standard input and printing the sorted indices.

1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It sorts book titles based on the specified asc-desc-ending order using a custom comparator function.
2. Yes, the code logic is completely correct. The custom key function correctly generates a sort key for each book title, and the sorting is performed based on these keys.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified. It uses the function signature and input/output format as described.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `sort_books` function is implemented to perform the sorting, and the `main` function handles input and output.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The code uses standard library imports which are correctly included.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as the code is self-contained within a single file.

1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum radius of a park that includes at least k bird habitats by computing the squared distances from the origin, sorting them, and then finding the k-th smallest distance.
2. Yes, the code logic is completely correct. It uses the correct approach of sorting the squared distances and selecting the k-th smallest to determine the minimum radius.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified. It uses the correct function signature and input/output format.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `minimum_radius` function is implemented to perform the required calculation, and the `main` function handles input and output as specified.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `math` module is used for the square root calculation, and `typing` is used for type annotations.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as this is a standalone script.

1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It correctly iterates over all possible combinations of digits for the placeholders '_' and 'X', checks for divisibility by 25, and ensures no leading zeros.
2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It handles the replacement of '_' and 'X' appropriately and checks the conditions for valid numbers.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as described. It uses `itertools.product` to generate combinations and follows the function signature provided.
4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The main function `count_possible_integers` is implemented and performs the required operations.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `itertools` module is imported as required.
6. Yes, methods from other files are not applicable here as the code is self-contained within `main.py`.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output.

This code implements the custom sorting algorithm as described in the user requirements. It uses a comparator function to sort the book titles based on the specified asc-desc-ending order. The `sort_books` function takes the number of books, the length of each book title, and the list of book titles as input, and returns the indices of the books sorted in the desired order. The input and output interfaces are designed to read from standard input and write to standard output, respectively.

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It correctly calculates the minimum radius of a park that includes at least k bird habitats using a binary search approach on the sorted Euclidean distances from the origin.

2. Yes, the code logic is completely correct. It calculates the Euclidean distances, sorts them, and uses binary search to find the minimum radius that includes at least k habitats, ensuring precision to meet the error requirement.

3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as specified. It uses the function signature and input/output format as described in the requirements.

4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `find_minimum_radius` function is implemented to perform the required calculations, and the `main` function handles input and output as specified.

5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `math` module is used for calculating the Euclidean distance, and `sys` is used for reading input.

6. Yes, methods from other files are not being reused, as the task is self-contained within the `main.py` file.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

This code implements the function `sort_books_asc_desc` which sorts book titles based on a custom order where characters at odd indices are sorted in ascending order and characters at even indices are sorted in descending order. The function uses a custom sort key to achieve this and returns the indices of the books in the sorted order. The main block handles input and output as specified.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). \n\nFind the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. \n\nA point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.\n\nIn this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.\n\nFormally, let your answer be a, and the jury\'s answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \\frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n8 4\n-3 1\n-4 4\n1 5\n2 2\n2 -2\n-2 -4\n-1 -1\n-6 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3.1622776589\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 1\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0.0000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Mr. Chanek can put the center of the park at (-3, -1) with radius √{10} ≈ 3.162. It can be proven this is the minimum r.\n\nThe following illustrates the first example. The blue points represent bird habitats and the red circle represents the amusement park.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

The strings are pairwise distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

```

This code defines a function `sort_books_asc_desc` that sorts book titles based on a custom order where characters at odd indices are sorted in ascending order and characters at even indices are sorted in descending order. The function uses a custom sort key to achieve this and returns the indices of the books in the sorted order. The main block handles input and output as specified.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

This code implements the solution using a binary search approach to find the minimum radius of a circle that includes at least `k` bird habitats. The function `find_minimum_radius` calculates the squared distances of each habitat from the origin, sorts these distances, and then determines the minimum radius by taking the square root of the `k`-th smallest distance. The `main` function handles input and output, ensuring the result is printed with the required precision.

Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Important Note: You must follow the input output format. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

## Explanation:
- The `sort_books_asc_desc` function sorts book titles based on the asc-desc-ending order rules.
- The `custom_sort_key` function generates a sort key for each book title, considering odd positions for ascending order and even positions for descending order.
- The `main` function handles input and output, calling the sorting function and printing the sorted indices.
- The code is modular, with clear separation of concerns, and follows Google-style guidelines.

There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). 

Find the minimum radius r of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. 

A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers.

In this problem, it is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be inside the park.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^5) — the position of the i-th bird habitat.

Output

Output a single real number r denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least k bird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a solution with r ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-4}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} ≤ 10^{-4}.

This code implements the solution using a binary search approach to find the minimum radius of a circle that can include at least `k` bird habitats. The function `minimum_radius` calculates the Euclidean distance of each habitat from the origin, sorts these distances, and returns the k-th smallest distance as the minimum radius. The `main` function handles input and output operations.
