1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the 'num2words' library to convert number words to numerals, sorts them, and converts them back to words.
2. The code logic is correct. It correctly converts number words to numerals, sorts them, and converts them back to words.
3. The existing code follows the specified data structures and interfaces. The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of number words as input and returns a string of sorted number words.
4. All functions are implemented as required.
5. No external dependencies are required as the code uses only the built-in 'num2words' library.
6. There are no methods from other files being reused in the code.

## Actions
No actions required.

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It circularly shifts the digits of the integer x based on the shift value.
2. The code logic is correct. It correctly handles circular shifting of digits and accounts for cases where the shift value is greater than the number of digits.
3. The existing code follows the specified data structures and interfaces.
4. All functions are implemented as required.
5. No external dependencies are required for this function.
6. There are no methods from other files being reused in this function.

## Actions

The revised code uses a list comprehension and `join` method to generate the string sequence, which is more concise and efficient.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'numbers separated by spaces'
    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the numbers in the string should be separated by spaces.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan suggests using built-in Python functions, we can implement the code as follows:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

# [edge case] 
    string_sequence(0) = '0'
    Explanation: When n is 0, the output should be '0' as it includes only the number 0.
    string_sequence(3) = '0 1 2 3'
    Explanation: When n is 3, the output should include numbers from 0 to 3 separated by spaces.

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers the edge cases as well.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'numerical sorting'
    Explanation: The core concept is to sort numbers represented as words in ascending order.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    1. Split the input string into a list of number words.
    2. Convert number words to numerals using the 'num2words' library.
    3. Sort the numerals in ascending order.
    4. Convert the sorted numerals back to number words.
    5. Join the sorted number words with spaces and return the result.

# [edge case] 
    sort_numbers('zero one two three four five six seven eight nine') = 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    Explanation: All numbers are already in ascending order, so the output remains the same.
    
    sort_numbers('nine eight seven six five four three two one zero') = 'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'
    Explanation: The numbers are in descending order, and after sorting, they are in ascending order.

    sort_numbers('five five five') = 'five five five'
    Explanation: All numbers are the same, so the output remains the same.

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers all scenarios.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'remove_duplicates'
    Explanation: The core concept is to remove all duplicate elements from a list of integers while preserving the original order of elements.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan already suggests using a set data structure to efficiently remove duplicates while maintaining the order of elements, the following logic can be implemented:
    
    1. Create an empty set to store unique elements.
    2. Create an empty list to store the final result.
    3. Iterate through the input list.
    4. For each element, check if it is already in the set.
    5. If not, add it to the set and the result list.
    6. Return the result list.

# [edge case] 
    remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) = [1, 3, 4]
    Explanation: In the input list [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], the duplicates are removed, and the order of elements is maintained. Hence, the expected output is [1, 3, 4].

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided above efficiently handles removing duplicates while maintaining the order of elements.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'Fibonacci number': A number in the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    'prime': A number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan suggests using open-source libraries, we can utilize libraries like sympy to efficiently find prime Fibonacci numbers. 
    Here is a high-level logic:
    - Generate Fibonacci numbers until we find the n-th number that is both prime and a Fibonacci number.
    - Check if each Fibonacci number is prime using sympy's isprime function.
    - Return the n-th number that satisfies both conditions.

# [edge case] 
    prime_fib(1) = 2
    Explanation: The first prime Fibonacci number is 2.
    prime_fib(2) = 3
    Explanation: The second prime Fibonacci number is 3.
    prime_fib(3) = 5
    Explanation: The third prime Fibonacci number is 5.

# [extra code for edge case]
    We need to handle the edge case where n is less than or equal to 0.
        if n <= 0:
            return "Invalid input, please provide a positive integer for n."
        (other code)

1. The code is not implemented as per the requirements. The function `is_fibonacci` is missing the correct logic to check if a number is a Fibonacci number. The function `isperfectsquare` is also missing. To achieve the correct implementation, we need to update the logic in both functions.
2. The code logic is not completely correct. The `is_fibonacci` function needs to be updated to correctly check if a number is a Fibonacci number. The `isperfectsquare` function is missing and needs to be implemented.
3. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" by defining the function `prime_fib(n: int) -> int`.
4. All necessary functions are not implemented. The `is_fibonacci` and `isperfectsquare` functions need to be implemented to achieve the correct functionality.
5. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported correctly.
6. There are no methods from other files being reused in the code.

## Actions
1. Update the `is_fibonacci` function to correctly check if a number is a Fibonacci number.
2. Implement the `isperfectsquare` function to check if a number is a perfect square.

The code is not implemented as per the requirements. The function `is_fibonacci` is missing the correct logic to check if a number is a Fibonacci number. The function `isperfectsquare` is also missing. To achieve the correct implementation, we need to update the logic in both functions.\n2. The code logic is not completely correct. The `is_fibonacci` function needs to be updated to correctly check if a number is a Fibonacci number. The `isperfectsquare` function is missing and needs to be implemented.\n3. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" by defining the function `prime_fib(n: int) -> int`.\n4. All necessary functions are not implemented. The `is_fibonacci` and `isperfectsquare` functions need to be implemented to achieve the correct functionality.\n5. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported correctly.\n6. There are no methods from other files being reused in the code.\n\n## Actions\n1. Update the `is_fibonacci` function to correctly check if a number is a Fibonacci number.\n2. Implement the `isperfectsquare` function to check if a number is a perfect square.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite the `main.py` based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite main.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## main.py\n...\n```\n'}]

2025-04-26 21:50:10.685 | ERROR    | metagpt.actions.design_api:_new_system_design:141 - We will design a static Python function using basic arithmetic operations to circularly shift the digits of an integer.
Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'circular shift'
    Explanation: Circular shift means shifting the digits of an integer in a circular manner, where the digits that are shifted out from one end are added back to the other end.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan is to design a static Python function using basic arithmetic operations to circularly shift the digits of an integer, the following logic can be implemented:
    1. Convert the integer x to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
    2. Calculate the effective shift by taking the modulo of shift with the number of digits in x.
    3. Perform the circular shift by concatenating the last effective shift digits with the first len(x) - effective shift digits.
    4. Handle negative integers by considering the sign while shifting.
    5. Return the result as a string.

# [edge case] 
    circular_shift(123, 3) = "123"
    Explanation: The number of digits is 3, and the shift is also 3. The circular shift will result in the same number "123".
    
    circular_shift(-123, 4) = "-321"
    Explanation: The number of digits is 3, and the effective shift is 1 (4 % 3). Shifting right by 1 results in "-321".

    circular_shift(0, 1) = "0"
    Explanation: The number is 0, and shifting any number of times will still result in "0".

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers scenarios where the shift is greater than the number of digits, negative integers, and zero.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'numbers separated by spaces'
    Explanation: The core concept is to generate a string that contains numbers separated by spaces.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan suggests using built-in Python libraries, we can implement the code as follows:
```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

# [edge case] 
    string_sequence(0) = '0'
    Explanation: When n is 0, the output should be '0' as it includes only the number 0.
    string_sequence(5) = '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    Explanation: When n is 5, the output should be '0 1 2 3 4 5' as it includes numbers from 0 to 5 separated by spaces.

# [extra code for edge case]
    No extra code needed to handle the edge cases. The logic provided covers all scenarios.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding
# [core concept]
    'space-delimited string': Refers to a string where numbers are separated by spaces.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    Since the plan suggests using the built-in Python library to convert number words to integers, sort them, and then convert them back to words, the following logic can be implemented:
    - Split the input string into a list of number words
    - Create a dictionary mapping number words to integers
    - Convert number words to integers using the dictionary
    - Sort the integers
    - Convert sorted integers back to number words
    - Join the sorted number words with spaces and return the result

# [edge case] 
    sort_numbers('zero one two') = 'zero one two'
    Explanation: The input is already sorted in ascending order, so the output remains the same.
    
    sort_numbers('five four three two one') = 'one two three four five'
    Explanation: The input is sorted in descending order, and the function should return the numbers sorted in ascending order.

    sort_numbers('seven seven seven') = 'seven seven seven'
    Explanation: All numbers are the same, so the output should be the same as the input.

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan covers sorting the numbers correctly.

Please read and understand the following inteperation before coding

# [core concept]
    'remove_duplicates'
    Explanation: The core concept is to remove all duplicate elements from a list of integers while preserving the original order.

# [phrase showing quantity relationship]
    No phrase showing quantity relationship

# [degree adverb] 
    No degree adverb

# [code logic]
    To implement the code logic:
    1. Create an empty set to store unique elements.
    2. Create an empty list to store the result.
    3. Iterate through the input list.
    4. For each element, check if it is already in the set.
    5. If not, add it to the set and the result list.
    6. Return the result list.

# [edge case] 
    remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) = [1, 3, 4]
    Explanation: In the input list, 2 appears twice, so one of them is removed. The order of elements is maintained, and duplicates are removed.

# [extra code for edge case]
    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided efficiently removes duplicates while maintaining order.
