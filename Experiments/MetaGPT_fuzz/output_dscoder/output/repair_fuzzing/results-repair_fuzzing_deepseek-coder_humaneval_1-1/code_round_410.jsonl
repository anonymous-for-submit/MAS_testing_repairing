The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term; if the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nNote: \n1.
