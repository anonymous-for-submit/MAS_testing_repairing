The original logic already correctly handles the case of an empty list by returning 0.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that sums all odd elements located at even indices in a given list of integers. The function should be efficient and handle both small and large lists. Clarity and simplicity in the code are crucial for maintainability and user understanding.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to correctly identify and sum odd numbers at even indices\n- Ensure the function works efficiently even for large lists\n- Maintain code clarity and ease of understanding\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness\n- Optimize the code for performance\nTo implement the function efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities. We will iterate through the list, checking each element at an even index to see if it is odd. If it is, we will add it to a running sum. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, leveraging Python's ability to handle lists and arithmetic operations effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd elements': means the numbers that are not divisible by 2\n    'even positions': means the positions in the list that are multiples of 2 (0, 2, 4, ...)\n\n    Explanation: The requirement is to sum up all the odd numbers that are located at even indices in the list. This involves checking each element at even indices and adding it to the sum if it is odd.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the list using a loop, checking each element at even indices. If the element is odd, add it to a running sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) = 12\n    Explanation: The even indices are 0 and 2. The elements at these positions are 5 and 7, both of which are odd. Their sum is 12.\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) = 9\n    Explanation: The even indices are 0, 2, and 4. The elements at these positions are all 3, which are odd. Their sum is 9.\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) = 0\n    Explanation: The even indices are 0 and 2. The elements at these positions are 30 and 24, which are not odd. The element at position 3 is 321, which is odd, but it's at an odd index (3), so it's not included. Therefore, the sum is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases, including lists with all even numbers or no odd numbers at even positions.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef solution(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n    '''Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.'''\n    sum_of_odds = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the element at the even index is odd\n            sum_of_odds += lst[i]\n    return sum_of_odds\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 395, "repair_prompt": ["def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
