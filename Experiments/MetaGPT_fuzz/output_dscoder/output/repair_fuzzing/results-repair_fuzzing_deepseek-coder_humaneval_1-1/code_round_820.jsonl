The function will iterate through the range from x to y, check for even numbers, and keep track of the largest one found. If no even number is found, it will return -1.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even integer': means an integer that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n    'inclusive range': means the range includes both endpoints x and y.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the largest even integer within the range.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate from x to y (inclusive)\n    Check if the current number is even\n    If it is even, compare it with the current largest even number found\n    Update the largest even number if the current number is larger\n    If no even number is found by the end of the range, return -1\n\n# [edge case] \n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    Explanation: The range is from 12 to 15, and the even numbers are 12, 14. The largest even number is 14.\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    Explanation: The range is from 12 to 13, but there are no even numbers in this range. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n    choose_num(8, 8) = 8\n    Explanation: The range includes only one number, which is 8, and it is an even number. Thus, the function returns 8.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases, including when x and y are the same.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that finds the largest even integer within a given range. The function should handle both x and y in any order and return -1 if no even number is found. This aligns with the user stories, which focus on ease of use, correct handling of inputs, and clear feedback for no results.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly identify the largest even integer within the given range.\n- The function should handle both x and y in any order.\n- The function should return -1 if no even number is found.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nTo implement the function `choose_num(x, y)` efficiently and correctly, we will use Python's built-in capabilities along with a simple approach to find the largest even integer within a given range. The function will first validate the inputs to ensure they are positive integers, then iterate through the range from the larger of the two inputs to the smaller, checking each number for evenness and updating the largest found even number.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even integer': means an integer that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n    'inclusive range': means the range includes both endpoints.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the largest even integer within the range.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps:\n    1.

The function should return -1 as there's no valid range to check for even numbers.\n    choose_num(7, 7) = -1\n    Explanation: The range includes only one number, 7, which is not even. Therefore, there's no even number to return.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The function already checks if the range is valid and returns -1 if it's not.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to find the largest even integer within a given range.
