After removal, the function should check if the resulting string is a palindrome. The function should return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to remove characters from string s based on characters in string c.\n- Check if the resulting string is a palindrome and return the result along with the string.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and handles edge cases.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy input and output.\nWe will implement the function `reverse_delete` using Python, leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities. The function will iterate through the string `s` and remove any character that matches any character found in `c`. After the characters are removed, the function will check if the resulting string is a palindrome. This approach ensures efficiency and ease of implementation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character matching and removal': This involves identifying characters in `s` that are present in `c` and removing them.\n    'palindrome check': This involves verifying if the resulting string reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Iterate through each character in `s` and check if it exists in `c`.\n    (2) If it does, do not include it in the result string.\n    (3) After processing all characters, check if the resulting string is a palindrome.\n    (4) Return the result string and the palindrome check result as a tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    reverse_delete(\"hello\", \"aeiou\") = (\"hll\", False)\n    Explanation: The characters 'e', 'o' are removed from \"hello\" as they are present in \"aeiou\".
