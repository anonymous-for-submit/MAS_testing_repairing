{"task_id": "HumanEval/86", "prompt": "def anti_shuffle(s):\t\n'''Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. Ordered version of a string refers to a format wherein each word (divided by space) is substituted by a fresh term featuring characters organized in increasing order according to their ascii value.

The function will split the input string into words, sort the characters in each word, and then join them back together while preserving spaces. This approach ensures that the function meets the requirements efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'ordered version': means that the characters in each word are sorted in ascending order of their ASCII values.\n    'preserve spaces': means that spaces in the original string should be retained in the same positions in the output string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Split the input string into words and spaces.\n    - Sort the characters in each word.\n    - Join the sorted words and spaces back together.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    explanation: An empty string remains empty after the function is applied.\n    anti_shuffle('a') = 'a'\n    explanation: A single character string remains unchanged.\n    anti_shuffle('cba') = 'abc'\n    explanation: The entire string is treated as a single word, and its characters are sorted.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic already correctly handles an empty string.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': means that all integers in the list are greater than 0.\n    'at least as many times': means the frequency of an integer in the list is greater than or equal to the integer itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means we need to find integers greater than 0.\n    'at least as many times': means we need to find integers whose frequency in the list is greater than or equal to the integer itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means we need the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    - Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    - Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    - Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears twice, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'ordered version': means that the characters in each word are sorted in ascending order of their ASCII values.\n    'preserve spaces': means that spaces in the original string should be retained in the same positions in the output string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Split the input string into words and spaces.\n    - Sort the characters in each word.\n    - Join the sorted words and spaces back together.\n\n# [edge case] \n    anti_shuffle('') = ''\n    explanation: An empty string remains empty after the function is applied.\n    anti_shuffle('a') = 'a'\n    explanation: A single character string remains unchanged.\n    anti_shuffle('cba') = 'abc'\n    explanation: The entire string is treated as a single word, and its characters are sorted.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
