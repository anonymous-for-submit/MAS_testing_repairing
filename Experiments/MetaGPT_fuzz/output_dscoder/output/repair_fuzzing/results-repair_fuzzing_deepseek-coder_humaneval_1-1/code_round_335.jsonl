The function should be able to process strings with special characters as well.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should process the string and toggle the case of letters.\n- The function should check if the string contains any letters.\n- If the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string.\n- The function should handle special characters in the string.\nWe will implement the function by first checking if the string contains any letters. If it does, we will iterate through each character in the string, toggling the case of each letter. If the string contains no letters, we will reverse the entire string. Special characters will be left unchanged.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case toggling': changing the case of a letter from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.\n    'string reversal': flipping the order of characters in a string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - First, check if the string contains any letters.\n    - If it does, iterate through each character:\n        - If the character is a letter, toggle its case.\n        - If the character is not a letter, leave it unchanged.\n    - If the string contains no letters, reverse the entire string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    Explanation: The string contains no letters, so we reverse the string.\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so we toggle the case of each letter.\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters and special characters. Letters are toggled, and special characters remain unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 128], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solve(s: str) -> str:\n    # Check if the string contains any letters\n    contains_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n    \n    if contains_letters:\n        # Toggle the case of each letter\n        result = []\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isalpha():\n                if char.islower():\n                    result.append(char.upper())\n                else:\n                    result.append(char.lower())\n            else:\n                result.append(char)\n        return ''.join(result)\n    else:\n        # Reverse the entire string\n        return s[::-1]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 335, "repair_prompt": ["def solve(s):\t\n'''You are given a string s.
