The example provided shows how the function should work with specific strings.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to count distinct characters in a string\n- Ensure the function is case insensitive\n- Include all characters, including punctuation and spaces\n- Add functionality to handle large strings efficiently\n- Include unit tests for the function\nTo implement the function that counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, considering case insensitivity and including all characters including punctuation and spaces, we can use Python's built-in capabilities. We will convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity and use a set to keep track of distinct characters. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's standard library.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distinct characters': means unique characters in a string, regardless of their case or type.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to count all unique characters in a string, ignoring case sensitivity and including all characters including punctuation and spaces.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int`, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters encountered in the string.\n    3. Iterate through each character in the string and add it to the set if it's not already present.\n    4. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    count_distinct_characters('12345') = 5\n    Explanation: All characters in the string '12345' are digits and are considered distinct since the function is case insensitive and includes all characters.\n    count_distinct_characters('Hello, World!') = 10\n    Explanation: The string contains 10 distinct characters including 'H', 'e', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'r', 'd', and '!', ignoring case and considering all characters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the logic provided in the plan already covers them. The function will return 0 for an empty string and correctly count distinct characters for non-empty strings.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, considering case insensitivity.
