Taking modulo 11 of 8 gives us 8.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The `pow` function in Python already handles the case when the exponent is 0 (which is the case in the edge case `modp(0, 101)`) by returning 1. For other edge cases like `modp(100, 101)`, the `pow` function will return the correct result without any additional handling.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the result of 2 raised to the power of n mod p (keep track of numbers).'''\n    return pow(2, n, p)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 574, "repair_prompt": ["def modp(n: int, p: int):\t\n'''Return the result of 2 raised to the power of n mod p (keep track of numbers).\n>>> modp(3, 5)\n    3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n    2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n    1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n    8\n    >>> modp(100, 101)\n    1\n    '''", " def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    '''Return the result of 2 raised to the power of n mod p (keep track of numbers).\n    The function calculates 2^n modulo p and returns the result.\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n        3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n        2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n        1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n        8\n    >>> modp(100, 10", " def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    '''Return the result of 2 raised to the power of n mod p (keep track of numbers).\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n        3\n        >>> modp(1101, 101)\n        2\n        >>> modp(0, 101)\n        1\n        >>> modp(3, 11)\n        8\n        >>> modp(100, 101)\n        1\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 444}
