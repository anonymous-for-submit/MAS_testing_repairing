All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

The simulation will involve updating these positions based on their movement patterns (left to right and right to left). Collisions will be detected by checking if a car from the left to right set is at the same position as a car from the right to left set.\n\n# [edge case] \n    car_race_collision(0) = \"Invalid input\"\n    Explanation: If there are no cars, there can't be any collisions. This is an edge case that should return an error message or handle the situation appropriately.\n    car_race_collision(-5) = \"Invalid input\"\n    Explanation: A negative number of cars doesn't make sense in this context. This should return an error message.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    ```python\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Invalid input\"\n    ```\n\nThis code checks if the number of cars is less than or equal to zero and returns an \"Invalid input\" message if true. This ensures that the function does not proceed with invalid inputs.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.
