The doctests provided give clear examples of expected outputs for specific inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to filter positive numbers accurately.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for readability and maintainability.\n- Handle edge cases such as empty lists, lists with all negative numbers, and lists with zero.\n- Include tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.\n- Document the function with clear explanations and examples.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a function that filters positive numbers from a list. This approach leverages Python's simplicity and readability, making it easy to understand and maintain. The function will utilize list comprehension, which is both efficient and elegant for this task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive numbers'\n    In the requirement, it means that we are only interested in numbers that are greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using list comprehension to filter out positive numbers from the list. Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n    2. Check if the element is greater than zero.\n    3. If the element is positive, include it in the new list.\n    4. Return the new list containing only positive numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_positive([-1, -2, -3]) = []\n    Explanation: Since there are no positive numbers in the list, the expected output is an empty list.\n    get_positive([0, 1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The function should return all positive numbers, which are 1, 2, and 3, as 0 is not considered positive.\n    get_positive([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: The function should return all positive numbers from the list, excluding 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of list comprehension will naturally handle cases where the list contains no positive numbers or only non-numeric elements.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef get_positive(l: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters positive numbers from a list.\n\n    Args:\n        l (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of positive integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in l if num > 0]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 942, "repair_prompt": ["def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Only positive numbers in the list should be returned.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 5, 6]\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    '''", " def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Only positive numbers in the list should be returned.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    Only the positive numbers in the list should be returned.\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    Only the positive numbers in the list should be returned.\n    '''", " def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Only positive numbers in the list should be returned.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 5, 6]\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 715}
