The function will sum the first two numbers and check if the result equals the third number. It will also use type() to ensure all inputs are integers. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of two numbers equals the third number'\n    This means that for any three given numbers, if one of them is equal to the sum of the other two, the function should return true.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will sum the first two numbers and check if the result equals the third number. It will also use type() to ensure all inputs are integers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    any_int(0, 0, 0) = True\n    Explanation: Since all numbers are zero, the sum of any two zeros is zero, which is equal to the third zero. Therefore, the function should return true.\n    any_int(1, -1, 0) = True\n    Explanation: The sum of 1 and -1 is 0, which is equal to the third number. All numbers are integers, so the function should return true.\n    any_int(2.5, 2.5, 5) = False\n    Explanation: Although the sum of 2.5 and 2.5 is 5, the numbers are not integers, so the function should return false.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The function already checks if the numbers are integers using the type() function.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should take three numbers as input and check if one of them is equal to the sum of the other two. It should return True if the condition is met and all numbers are integers, otherwise, it should return False. The function should handle both positive and negative integers correctly.

We will ensure that the function accurately checks the conditions and returns the appropriate boolean value.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of two numbers equals the third number'\n    In the requirement, it means that the sum of any two of the three numbers should be equal to the third number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to implement the function:\n    1.
