These rules include the format of the name, the position of the dot, and the content of the name before and after the dot.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than three digits': This phrase indicates that the file name should not contain more than three digits.\n    Explanation: This means that in the file name, there should not be more than three occurrences of any digit from '0' to '9'.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This degree adverb implies that in the context of the requirement, 'largest' refers to the maximum number of digits allowed in the file name.\n    Explanation: In this case, 'largest' means the highest number of digits (up to three) that are allowed in the file name.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests a multi-step process to validate the file name:\n    1.

Verify the substring after the dot is one of the specified extensions.\n    4. Count the number of digits in the file name to ensure it does not exceed three.\n\n    Steps to implement:\n    1. Split the file name into two parts using the dot as a delimiter.\n    2. Check if the part before the dot is a non-empty string and starts with a letter.\n    3. Check if the part after the dot is one of the allowed extensions.\n    4. Count the digits in the file name and ensure the count does not exceed three.\n\n# [edge case] \n    file_name_check(\"example.txt\") = 'Yes'\n    Explanation: This file name meets all the criteria: it has exactly one dot, the substring before the dot is \"example\" which starts with a letter and is not empty, and the extension \"txt\" is valid.\n    file_name_check(\"1example.dll\") = 'No'\n    Explanation: This file name does not start with a letter, so it fails the first condition.\n    file_name_check(\"example123.txt\") = 'Yes'\n    Explanation: This file name has exactly one dot, the substring before the dot starts with a letter, and the extension is valid.
