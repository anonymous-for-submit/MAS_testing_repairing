The function will iterate through all numbers less than 'n', check if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and then count the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers. We will use Python's built-in string manipulation to count the digit 7.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'digit 7': means we are looking for the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers less than 'n' that are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    'divisible by': means the number is a multiple of 11 or 13.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through all numbers less than 'n', check if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and then count the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fizz_buzz(0) = 0\n    explanation: Since there are no numbers less than 0, the function should return 0.\n    fizz_buzz(-10) = 0\n    explanation: Since the input is negative, there are no numbers less than -10, so the function should return 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The function can simply return 0 for any non-positive input.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'digit 7': means we are looking for the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers less than 'n' that are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    'divisible by': means the number is a multiple of 11 or 13.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through all numbers less than 'n', check if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and then count the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fizz_buzz(0) = 0\n    explanation: Since there are no numbers less than 0, the function should return 0.\n    fizz_buzz(-10) = 0\n    explanation: Since the input is negative, there are no numbers less than -10, so the function should return 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
