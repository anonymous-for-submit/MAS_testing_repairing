The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->

The goal is to determine how far off each guess was. If the guess matches the score, the difference is 0; otherwise, the difference is the absolute value of the difference between the guess and the score.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': means the number of times a number appears in the list.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the phrase \"appears at least as many times as the integer itself\" is used to find integers that appear at least as many times as their value in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more than': means greater than.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb 'more than' is used to specify that the integer must appear more than its value to be considered.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to be considered simultaneously:\n    1.

Therefore, the function should return 1 as the integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n    search([1, 2, 3, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the integers in the list appear at least as many times as themselves. Hence, the function should return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can be used to check if any integer appears at least as many times as itself and return it if found, or -1 if not.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'sliding window': means a way to scan through a string or list with a window that slides over the elements.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the sliding window approach is used to find all occurrences of the substring within the original string, including overlapping instances.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two times': means the number of times a substring appears in a string.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"Find how many times a specific substring appears within the original string. Include overlapping instances.\" indicates that we need to count the occurrences of the substring, including overlaps.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'shortest': means the smallest number of characters in the substring.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb 'shortest' is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but it could be inferred as the smallest substring length to be considered for counting.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests identifying the length of the original string and the substring, iterating through the original string to find all occurrences of the substring, and counting the number of occurrences found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: An empty substring appears four times in the original string 'abc'. The count method would return 4 in this case.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that compares two arrays of scores and guesses, returning an array indicating how far off each guess was.
