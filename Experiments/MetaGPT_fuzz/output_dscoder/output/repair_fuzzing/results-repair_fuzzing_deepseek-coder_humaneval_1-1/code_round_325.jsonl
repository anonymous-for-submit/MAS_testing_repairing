Here, the GCD of 12 and 0 is 12.\n    greatest_common_divisor(18, 48) = 6\n    Explanation: Using the Euclidean algorithm, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one repeatedly until one of the numbers becomes zero. The steps are as follows:\n        1. 48 - 18 = 30\n        2. 30 - 18 = 12\n        3. 18 - 12 = 6\n        4. 12 - 6 = 6\n        5. 6 - 6 = 0\n        The non-zero number at this point is 6, which is the GCD of 18 and 48.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The Euclidean algorithm inherently handles cases where one of the numbers is zero by returning the other number as the GCD.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of the two integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 325, "repair_prompt": ["def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\t\n'''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
