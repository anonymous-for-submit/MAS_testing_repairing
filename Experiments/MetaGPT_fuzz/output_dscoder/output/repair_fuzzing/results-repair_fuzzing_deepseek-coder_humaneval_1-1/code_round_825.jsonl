This involves ensuring that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function should handle basic cases and edge cases effectively.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check bracket pairing\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases and invalid inputs\n- Optimize the function for performance and readability\n- Include detailed error messages for debugging\n- Test the function with various bracket combinations\nTo implement the function `correct_bracketing`, we will use a simple and efficient approach that leverages Python's built-in data structures and logic. The function will iterate through the string of brackets, using a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If these conditions are met, the top element is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets were correctly paired. Otherwise, there are unmatched brackets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'stack': A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). It is a collection of elements, with operations on the top of the stack only. The topmost element is always removed first.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a clear approach to implement the function `correct_bracketing` using a stack. The steps include:\n    1. Initialize an empty stack.\n    2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n    3. If the character is an opening bracket '(', push it onto the stack.\n    4. If the character is a closing bracket ')', check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is '('. If so, pop the stack.\n    5. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, return True, indicating all brackets were correctly paired.
