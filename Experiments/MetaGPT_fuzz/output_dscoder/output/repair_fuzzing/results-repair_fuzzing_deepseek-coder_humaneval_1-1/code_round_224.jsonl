Iterate through each number in the list.\n    2. For each number, calculate the digit sum, considering the sign.\n    3. Check if the digit sum exceeds 0.\n    4. Count the numbers that meet the condition.\n    5. Return the count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_nums([-123, 456, 789, -321]) = 2\n    Explanation:\n    - For -123, the digit sum is -1 + 2 + 3 = 4 (exceeds 0)\n    - For 456, the digit sum is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 (exceeds 0)\n    - For 789, the digit sum is 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 (exceeds 0)\n    - For -321, the digit sum is -3 + 2 + 1 = 0 (does not exceed 0)\n    So, there are 2 numbers whose digit sum exceeds 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers the edge case where the digit sum of a negative number exceeds 0.\n"], "scores": [0.8958, 0.8958, 0.2396, 0.8958, 1.0, 0.2708, 0.8958, 0.8958, 0.2708, 0.8438], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [86, 86, 23, 86, 96, 26, 86, 86, 26, 81], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef count_nums(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    '''\n    Takes a list of integers and returns the quantity of numbers whose digit sum exceeds 0.\n    Args:\n        arr (List[int]): List of integers.\n    Returns:\n        int: Count of numbers with digit sum exceeding 0.\n    '''\n    count = 0\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        digit_sum = 0\n        n = abs(num)\n        \n        while n > 0:\n            digit_sum += n % 10\n            n //= 10\n        \n        if num < 0:\n            digit_sum -= 2 * (abs(num) % 10)\n        \n        if digit_sum > 0:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 224, "repair_prompt": ["def count_nums(arr):\t\n'''Write a function count_nums which takes a list of integers and returns the quantity of numbers whose digit sum exceeds 0.
