For example, in the list [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the rolling maximum would be [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] because the maximum value seen at each point is recorded.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the rolling_max function, we will:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximum values.\n    2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum value, starting with a very low value (e.g., negative infinity).\n    3. Iterate through the list of numbers:\n        - For each number, check if it is greater than the current maximum.\n        - If it is, update the current maximum and append it to the result list.\n        - If it is not, simply append the current maximum to the result list.\n    4. Return the result list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]) = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: The edge case is a standard list with no special conditions. The function should correctly compute the rolling maximum for each element in the list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for this edge case as the provided logic already handles the standard list scenario.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': means that all integers in the list are greater than 0.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the list provided to the function is non-empty and contains only positive integers. This is a fundamental condition that ensures the function operates correctly without worrying about negative numbers or zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find an integer greater than 0.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find the integer whose occurrences are greater than or equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the largest integer that appears more than or equal to its value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the search function, we will:\n    1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    4. Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for this edge case as the provided logic already handles the standard list scenario.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping': means that we can count the overlapping appearances of a substring in the original string.\n    Explanation: The requirement allows for overlapping occurrences of the substring within the original string. This means that when a match is found, the search continues from the next character, potentially including the next occurrence of the substring within the same instance of the original string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the how_many_times function, we will:\n    1.

If a match is found, increment the counter variable.\n    6. Return the final count of occurrences.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: The empty string '' appears four times in the original string 'abc'. The count method would return 2, but considering overlapping, it should be 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements call for a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers representing the rolling maximum up to each point in the sequence.
