The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings with mixed case characters. The performance of the function should be efficient to handle large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the sum of ASCII codes for uppercase characters.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings with mixed case characters.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- The function should be user-friendly and easy to integrate into other projects.\n- The function should be documented and include examples in the documentation.\nWe will use Python's built-in functions and a simple loop to iterate through the string, checking each character to see if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, we will add its ASCII value to a running total. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strong standard library.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'ASCII codes': The core concept here is the use of ASCII values, which represent characters in the ASCII table. In this case, we are interested in the uppercase characters only.\n    Explanation: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns unique numeric codes to letters, digits, and other characters. The ASCII table ranges from 0 to 127.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `digitSum(s)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

If it is, add its ASCII value to the sum.\n    5. Return the final sum after the loop completes.\n\n# [edge case] \n    digitSum(\"\") = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the sum of ASCII values is 0.\n    digitSum(\"abc\") = 198\n    Explanation: The string contains no uppercase letters, so only their ASCII values are summed, which are 97 (a) + 98 (b) + 99 (c) = 198.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles the case of an empty string by returning 0.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'uppercase characters': The core concept here is focusing on characters that are uppercase letters.\n    Explanation: Uppercase letters are a subset of the alphabet and are represented by letters from 'A' to 'Z'.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find integers that appear more than once in the list.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase indicates that we need to find integers that appear at least as many times as their value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a straightforward approach to finding the largest integer in a list that appears at least as many times as itself. The steps include:\n    1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    4. Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears three times, and number 4 appears three times. None of them appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles the case where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'ASCII values': The core concept here is the use of ASCII values, which represent characters in the ASCII table.\n    Explanation: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique number to each character used in digital communication, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and other symbols.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a straightforward approach to summing the ASCII values of all characters in a string. The steps include:\n    1. Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n    2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n    3. Add the ASCII value of the character to the sum.\n    4. Return the final sum after the loop completes.\n\n# [edge case] \n    digitSum(\"\") = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the sum of ASCII values is 0.\n    digitSum(\"abc\") = 294\n    Explanation: The string contains all lowercase letters, so their ASCII values are summed, which are 97 (a) + 98 (b) + 99 (c) = 294.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
