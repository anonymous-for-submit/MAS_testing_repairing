This approach is both efficient and leverages Python's robust standard library. The function will handle large values of `n` and `p` by utilizing the properties of modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and ensure performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'modular exponentiation': This is the process of raising a number to a power and then taking the result modulo some other number. This is useful in situations where the result of the exponentiation could be extremely large, and we only need the remainder when divided by some other number.\n    Explanation: In the given requirement, we need to compute \\(2^n \\mod p\\). This is a common problem in cryptography and number theory, where large powers of a number need to be computed and reduced modulo a prime number for security reasons.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)`, we can use Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments.

This is efficient and handles large numbers due to its implementation in C, which is optimized for performance with large integers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1000, 1001) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 1001\\), \\(2^{1000} \\mod 1001\\) is calculated. Since 1001 is a prime number, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently compute this. The result is 1 because \\(2^{1000} \\mod 1001\\) is 1 when \\(2^{1000}\\) is divided by 1001, due to Fermat's Little Theorem which states \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\) for a prime \\(p\\) and integer \\(a\\) not divisible by \\(p\\).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

This function computes \\(2^n \\mod p\\) efficiently. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    ```python\n    def modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n        return pow(2, n, p)\n    ```\n\n    This function uses the `pow` method which takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. It computes \\(2^n \\mod p\\) in an efficient manner, handling large numbers appropriately.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1101, 101) = 2\n    Explanation: The value of \\(2^{1101} \\mod 101\\) is computed efficiently using the `pow` function with the modulus argument. The result is 2, which is the remainder when \\(2^{1101}\\) is divided by 101.\n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: Since any number to the power of 0 is 1, \\(2^0 \\mod 101\\) is 1.\n    modp(3, 11) = 8\n    Explanation: The value of \\(2^3 \\mod 11\\) is computed as 8. This is the remainder when \\(2^3\\) is divided by 11.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The `pow` function in Python already takes care of large numbers and the modulus operation, so the provided logic is sufficient for all inputs.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.975, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 117, 120, 120], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes 2^n modulo p.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent.\n        p (int): The modulus.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The result of 2^n modulo p.\n    \"\"\"\n    return pow(2, n, p)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 150, "repair_prompt": ["def modp(n: int, p: int):\t\n'''Return 2^n modulo p.
