This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strong string handling capabilities.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'uppercase vowels': means that we are looking for the uppercase versions of the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.\n    'even indices': means that we are considering every second character in the string, starting from index 0.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a clear approach to the problem.
