This involves understanding the properties of even numbers and their sums, as well as developing an efficient algorithm to check this condition.

An even number is a multiple of 2, and the sum of four even numbers will always be even. Therefore, we only need to check if the number n is even and greater than or equal to 8 (since the smallest sum of four positive even integers is 2+2+2+2=8). If n is even and greater than or equal to 8, we can check if it is divisible by 4, as a number that is divisible by 4 can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers in multiple ways.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive even integers': means that all integers used in the sum are even and greater than zero.\n    'sum of precisely 4': means that exactly four even numbers are used to reach the total sum.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'precisely': means that we need to find a specific number of even integers that add up to the given number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'positive': means that all integers used are greater than zero.\n    'even': means that all integers used are divisible by 2.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we need to check if `n` is an even number and greater than or equal to 8. If `n` is even and `n >= 8`, we then check if `n` is divisible by 4. If `n` is divisible by 4, it can be expressed as the sum of four even integers in multiple ways.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) = False\n    Explanation: 4 is not even, so it cannot be expressed as the sum of even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) = False\n    Explanation: 6 is not even, so it cannot be expressed as the sum of even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) = True\n    Explanation: 8 is even and greater than or equal to 8.
