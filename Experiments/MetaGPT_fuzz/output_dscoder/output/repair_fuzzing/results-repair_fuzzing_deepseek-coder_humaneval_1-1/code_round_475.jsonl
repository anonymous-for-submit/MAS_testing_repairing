The function will iterate through the string of brackets and use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, the top of the stack will be popped. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the corresponding opening bracket, the function will return False.

For each opening bracket encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. For each closing bracket, it is checked if there is a corresponding opening bracket on the top of the stack. If there is, the opening bracket is popped from the stack; otherwise, the brackets are not correctly bracketed. The final check is whether the stack is empty, which would indicate that all opening brackets have been correctly matched with closing brackets.\n\n# [edge case] \n    correct_bracketing(\")(\") = False\n    Explanation: This edge case represents a string with alternating brackets, where the first bracket is a closing bracket and the second is an opening bracket.
