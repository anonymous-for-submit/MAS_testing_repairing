Since we need to return a string containing words whose lengths are prime numbers, and we need to maintain the order of the words in the new string as in the original one, we can return \"4 5\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. We can directly implement the logic to check for prime numbers and filter the words based on their lengths.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to filter words in a sentence based on their length, specifically focusing on prime numbers. This ensures that only words with unique lengths are selected, enhancing the readability and aesthetic of the output.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if a number is prime.\n- Create a function to filter words based on prime length.\n- Ensure the application is user-friendly and efficient.\n- Develop a visually appealing interface for better user experience.\nTo implement the function that filters words in a sentence based on their length, specifically focusing on prime numbers, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and the 'sympy' library for prime number checking. The 'sympy' library provides a convenient function to check if a number is prime, which will be leveraged in our solution.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime number': A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `words_in_sentence(sentence)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Split the sentence into words.\n    2. Check the length of each word to determine if it is a prime number.\n    3. Collect the words whose lengths are prime numbers.\n    4. Join the filtered words back into a single string, separated by spaces.\n    5. Return the resulting string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    words_in_sentence(\"hello world\") = \"\"\n    Explanation: The word \"hello\" has 5 letters, which is a prime number, but \"world\" has 5 letters as well, which is not the first word in the sentence. Therefore, no words are returned.\n\n    words_in_sentence(\"a b c d e\") = \"a b c d e\"\n    Explanation: All words in the sentence have prime lengths (1 for \"a\", 1 for \"b\", etc.), so all words are returned.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic will correctly return an empty string when no prime-length words are found.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to identify words in a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. This involves parsing the sentence, checking the length of each word, and determining if the length is prime. The output should be a string of these words in the order they appear in the original sentence.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if a number is prime.\n- Parse the input sentence to extract words.\n- Check the length of each word and filter those with prime lengths.\n- Return the filtered words as a string.\n- Ensure the application is user-friendly and intuitive.\nTo implement the function `words_in_sentence`, we will follow these steps: First, we will create a helper function to check if a number is prime. Then, we will parse the input sentence to extract words. Next, we will check the length of each word and filter those with prime lengths. Finally, we will return the filtered words as a string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime number': A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `words_in_sentence`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Both are prime numbers, but since we need to return a string containing the words from the original sentence, whose lengths are prime numbers, we return \"hello\" as it appears first in the original sentence.\n\n    words_in_sentence(\"this is a test\") = \"this\"\n    Explanation: The lengths of the words \"this\", \"is\", and \"test\" are 4, 2, and 4, respectively. Only \"is\" has a prime length (2). Therefore, we return \"this\" as it appears first in the original sentence.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic is sufficient to return the first word with a prime length.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to filter words in a sentence based on their lengths being prime numbers. This involves checking each word's length against a prime number test and then returning those words in the order they appeared in the original sentence. The constraints limit the length of the sentence to 100 characters and require the input to contain only letters. The product should be user-friendly and efficient, handling sentences of varying complexities.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if a number is prime.\n- Iterate through each word in the sentence and check its length for primality.\n- Return a string containing words with prime lengths.\n- Ensure the product is user-friendly and can handle sentences up to 100 characters.\n- Optimize the algorithm for efficiency, especially for longer sentences.\nTo implement the function `words_in_sentence`, we will follow these steps: First, we will create a helper function to check if a number is prime.

The length of \"world\" is 5, which is also a prime number.
