The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy. They are strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nThis function outputs the number of such collisions.\n'''", "entry_point": "car_race_collision",
