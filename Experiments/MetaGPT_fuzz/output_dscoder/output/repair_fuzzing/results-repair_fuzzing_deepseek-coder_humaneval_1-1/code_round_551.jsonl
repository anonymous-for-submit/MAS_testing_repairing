The function will check each character in the string to determine if it's a letter and then toggle its case. If no letters are found, the function will reverse the string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case toggling': changing the case of a character from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa.\n    'string manipulation': using built-in methods to modify the string based on certain conditions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Check if the string contains any letters.\n    (2) If it does, iterate through each character, toggle its case if it's a letter, and keep it as is otherwise.\n    (3) If no letters are found, reverse the string.\n    (4) Return the modified string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    Explanation: The string contains no letters, so the function reverses it.\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so the function toggles their case.\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so the function toggles their case.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers the case where the string contains no letters by reversing it.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 0, 0, 128, 128, 128], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solve(s: str) -> str:\n    # Check if the string contains any letters\n    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n    \n    if has_letters:\n        # If letters are found, toggle case of each letter\n        result = []\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isupper():\n                result.append(char.lower())\n            elif char.islower():\n                result.append(char.upper())\n            else:\n                result.append(char)\n        return ''.join(result)\n    else:\n        # If no letters are found, reverse the string\n        return s[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(solve(\"1234\"))  # Output: \"4321\"\n# print(solve(\"ab\"))    # Output: \"AB\"\n# print(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # Output: \"#A@c\"\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 551, "repair_prompt": ["def solve(s):\t\n'''You are given a string s.  \n    if s[i] is a letter, change it from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa, \n    otherwise keep it as it is.  \n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.  \n    The function should return the resulted string.  \nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    '''", " You are given a string s.  \nif s[i] is a letter, change it from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa,  \notherwise keep it as it is.  \nIf the string contains no letters, reverse the string.  \nThe function should return the resulted string.  \nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"", " You are given a string s.  \nif s[i] is a letter, change it from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa,  \notherwise keep it as it is.  \nIf the string contains no letters, reverse the string.  \nThe function should return the resulted string.  \nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\""], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 443}
