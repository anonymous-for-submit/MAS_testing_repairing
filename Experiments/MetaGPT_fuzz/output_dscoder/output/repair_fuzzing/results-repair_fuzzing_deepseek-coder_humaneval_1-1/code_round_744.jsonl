Return the first number that does so. If no such number is found, return -1 (though this case is not expected based on the requirement).\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_divisor(1) = None\n    Explanation: Since 1 is not divisible by any number less than itself, the function should return None or an appropriate value to indicate that there is no valid largest divisor.\n    largest_divisor(0) = None\n    Explanation: Similar to the case for 1, 0 is not divisible by any positive number, so the function should return None or an appropriate value.\n    largest_divisor(-5) = None\n    Explanation: Negative numbers do not have divisors in the context of this function, as divisors are defined for positive integers. The function should return None or an appropriate value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n <= 0:\n            return None  # or raise an appropriate exception\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the largest divisor of a given number n that is less than n.
