The factors should be listed in order from smallest to largest, and each factor should be mentioned the number of times it appears in the factorization. The input number should be equal to the product of all factors. This requirement is clear and specific, focusing on functionality and output format.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately factorize the given integer.\n- The output should list the factors in order from smallest to largest.\n- The tool should handle large numbers efficiently.\n- The user interface should be simple and intuitive.\n- The product should be compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms.\nTo implement the prime factorization function efficiently and accurately, we will utilize the 'sympy' library, which provides a robust set of tools for symbolic mathematics in Python. This library includes functions for factorization, which can handle large numbers and return the prime factors in the required order. The user interface will be kept simple, with a clear input and output mechanism.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n Based on the provided plan and requirement, it appears that the plan does not align well with the requirement. The plan suggests using the 'sympy' library, which is not necessary for this specific task and might not be appropriate for the given requirements. Let's focus on the core concept and implementation details as per the user's requirement.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'prime factorization': The process of breaking down a composite number into a product of prime numbers. Each prime factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks for a function that takes an integer and returns a list of its prime factors in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor repeated according to its frequency in the factorization.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the prime factorization, we need to:\n    1. Check if the number is less than 2, in which case return an empty list since 0 and 1 are not prime and do not have prime factors.\n    2. Iterate through possible divisors starting from 2 up to the number itself.\n    3. For each divisor, check if it is a factor of the number.\n    4. If it is a factor, divide the number by this factor and count how many times this factor can divide the number.\n    5. Append the factor to the result list the number of times it divides the number.\n    6. Continue until the number is reduced to 1.\n    7.
