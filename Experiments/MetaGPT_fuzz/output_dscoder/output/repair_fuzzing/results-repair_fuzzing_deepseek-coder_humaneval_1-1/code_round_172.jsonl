The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to find the median for both odd and even-length lists.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to calculate the median of a list of numbers. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. The function should handle lists with both even and odd numbers of elements. It should also handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers.\n- The algorithm should be optimized for better performance.\nTo implement the median function efficiently and accurately, we will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities. This approach leverages Python's Timsort algorithm, which is both stable and efficient for sorting lists. The function will first sort the input list in non-decreasing order and then find the median based on whether the list length is odd or even. For an even-length list, the median will be the average of the two middle elements. For an odd-length list, the median is the middle element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'median': The middle value in a list of numbers; if the list has an odd number of observations, it is the middle one; if even, it is the average of the two middle numbers.\n    Explanation: The median is a statistical measure that represents the middle value of a dataset. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will first sort the input list in non-decreasing order.
