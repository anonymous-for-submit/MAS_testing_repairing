The function will handle the input list directly without needing to convert it to another data structure, ensuring minimal overhead. The function will also include basic error handling for non-integer inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum' and 'product'\n    In the requirement, it means to calculate the total sum of all integers in the list and the product of all integers in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using Python's built-in functions to calculate the sum and product. This can be done using the `sum()` function for the sum and the `math.prod()` function for the product if Python version >= 3.8, or a manual multiplication approach for products if using an older Python version.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: The sum of an empty list is 0, and the product of an empty list is 1 (assuming an empty product as the mathematical convention).\n    sum_product([0]) = (0, 0)\n    Explanation: The sum of a list containing 0 is 0, and the product of a list containing 0 is also 0 (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The built-in functions in Python will automatically handle the case of an empty list by returning 0 for the sum and 1 for the product.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive integers'\n    In the requirement, it means that all integers in the list are positive and greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than zero'\n    This phrase indicates that we need to consider only positive integers.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest'\n    This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests creating a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer, then iterating through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) = 2\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears twice, which is more than its value (2), and it is the largest number that meets this condition.\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 3 appears three times, which is more than its value (3), and it is the largest number that meets this condition.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the numbers (5, 4) appear more than their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic in the plan will naturally handle cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'empty list'\n    In the requirement, it means a list with no elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using Python's built-in functions to calculate the sum and product efficiently.
