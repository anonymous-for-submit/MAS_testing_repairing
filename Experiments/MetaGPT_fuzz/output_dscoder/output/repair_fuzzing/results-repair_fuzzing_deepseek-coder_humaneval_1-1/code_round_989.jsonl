This can be achieved using a stack data structure, which allows for efficient checking of matching brackets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'bracket matching'\n    In the requirement, it means ensuring that every opening bracket \"(\" has a corresponding closing bracket \")\".\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using a stack data structure to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
