The function should handle incorrect inputs gracefully by returning an empty tuple.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to validate planet names and ensure they are part of the solar system.\n- Develop a mechanism to determine the order of planets based on their proximity to the Sun.\n- Ensure the function returns a tuple of planets between the two given planets, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.\n- Implement error handling to manage incorrect or invalid planet names.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nWe will use Python's built-in data structures and a simple validation approach to ensure the input planet names are valid. We will define the order of planets based on their proximity to the Sun and use this order to filter and sort the planets between the two given planets. Error handling will be implemented to manage incorrect or invalid planet names.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planets in the solar system': means the eight planets known to be in our solar system\n    'proximity to the Sun': means the order of the planets from the closest to the farthest from the Sun\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf(\"Pluto\", \"Mars\") = ()\n    Explanation: Pluto is not considered a planet, so the function should return an empty tuple.\n    bf(\"Sun\", \"Earth\") = ()\n    Explanation: The input is invalid as \"Sun\" cannot be before \"Earth\" in the solar system.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n            return ()\n        (other code)\n\nNote: The code logic and edge case handling are not provided in the plan, so I cannot generate a detailed response for these sections.
