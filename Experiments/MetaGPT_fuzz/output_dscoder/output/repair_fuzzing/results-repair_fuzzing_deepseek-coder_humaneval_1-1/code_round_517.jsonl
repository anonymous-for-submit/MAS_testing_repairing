The original logic will return an empty list when there are no even values or the array is empty.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'smallest even value'\n    Explanation: The core concept is to find the smallest even value in the array. If there are multiple even values, the one with the smallest index is chosen.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest'\n    The degree adverb 'smallest' indicates that we need to find the smallest value among the even numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so there are no even values to pluck. The expected output is an empty list.\n    pluck([1, 3, 5, 7]) = []\n    Explanation: All the values in the array are odd, so there are no even values to pluck.
