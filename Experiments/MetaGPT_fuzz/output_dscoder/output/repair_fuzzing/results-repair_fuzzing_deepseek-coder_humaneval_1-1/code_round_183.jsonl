The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    Make sure to handle cases where arrays are empty or contain negative values appropriately.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    '''", "entry_point":

The function will iterate through both arrays, calculate the difference between the scores and guesses, and return an array indicating how far off each guess was.

The function will iterate through both arrays, calculate the absolute difference between the guess and the score, and return the results in a new array.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'comparison': means comparing the actual results with the guessed results.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves comparing the scores of matches with the guesses made by a player.
