determines if a given number is a product of exactly three prime numbers. The function should be efficient and handle numbers up to 100. Clarifications are needed on the exact behavior for numbers that are not products of exactly three primes, such as numbers with more or fewer prime factors.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should accurately determine if a number is a product of three prime numbers.\n- The function should be capable of handling numbers up to 100 efficiently.\n- The user interface should be simple and intuitive.\n- The product should be visually appealing and responsive.\nTo implement the function `is_multiply_prime(a)` that determines if a given number is a product of exactly three prime numbers, we will use Python's built-in capabilities along with the 'sympy' library for prime number checking. The 'sympy' library provides a function to check if a number is prime, which simplifies our task significantly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'multiplication of 3 prime numbers': means the product of exactly three prime numbers\n\n    'less than 100': means the number being checked must be less than 100\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'multiplication': means we need to find the product of three prime numbers\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'exactly': means we need to ensure that only three prime numbers are used in the multiplication\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_multiply_prime(a)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Use a nested loop to find all combinations of three prime numbers that multiply to give `a`.\n    2. Check if the product of these three prime numbers equals `a`.\n    3. Return `True` if the product matches `a`, otherwise return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_multiply_prime(15) = False\n    Explanation: 15 cannot be expressed as the product of exactly three prime numbers.
