Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    2. Divide `n` by this prime number as long as it is divisible.\n    3. Increment the prime number by 1 and repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.\n    4. The largest prime number that divides `n` at any point is the largest prime factor.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(1) = None\n    Explanation: Since the function assumes `n > 1` and is not a prime, the input 1 is not valid according to the requirement.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if n <= 1:\n            return None  # or raise an error, depending on the expected behavior for invalid input\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the largest prime factor of a given number. The algorithm should be efficient and handle large numbers. The output should be clear and easy to understand. The solution should be user-friendly and provide immediate feedback.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an efficient algorithm to find the largest prime factor.\n- Ensure the program can handle large numbers efficiently.\n- Provide clear and easy-to-understand output.\n- Ensure the program is user-friendly and provides immediate feedback.\n- Enhance the user experience with a visually appealing interface.\nTo implement the function efficiently, we will use a combination of trial division and optimization techniques. We will start by testing divisibility by the smallest prime numbers and gradually increase the divisor. This approach will ensure that we efficiently find the largest prime factor. We will also use a simple and clean interface to enhance user experience.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime factor': A prime factor is a factor of a given number that is a prime number. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests a logical approach to finding the largest prime factor of a given number. The steps include:\n    1. Starting with the smallest prime number, 2.\n    2. Dividing the number by this prime number if it is divisible.\n    3. If not divisible, move to the next prime number.\n    4. Repeat the process until the number is reduced to 1.\n    5. The largest number that divides the original number without leaving a remainder is the largest prime factor.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(1) = None\n    Explanation: By definition, 1 is not a prime number and does not have prime factors. The function should return None or raise an error for this input.\n    largest_prime_factor(2) = None\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that n > 1 and n is not a prime, the function should return None or raise an error for n = 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if n <= 1:\n            return None  # or raise ValueError(\"n must be greater than 1\")\n        (other code)\n\n    This additional check ensures that the function does not process numbers that do not meet the specified conditions, providing a robust solution.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the largest prime factor of n.
