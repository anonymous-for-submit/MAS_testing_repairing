A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters within the string are distinct. This requirement is crucial for ensuring the output meets the specified criteria and enhances user experience by providing clear and accurate results.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check if a string is happy.\n- Ensure the function handles strings of varying lengths efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy string input and result interpretation.\n- Optimize the application for performance and responsiveness.\n- Design a clean and intuitive UI for better user engagement.\nTo implement the function 'is_happy' that checks if a string is happy, we need to ensure that the string meets two conditions: it must be at least 3 characters long, and every 3 consecutive characters must be distinct. We will use Python's built-in string operations and a simple loop to check these conditions efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'happy string': a string with at least 3 characters where every 3 consecutive characters are distinct.\n    Explanation: A happy string is defined by its length and the distinctness of every 3 consecutive characters. This means the string must be at least 3 characters long, and no 3 consecutive characters should be the same.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 3': means the string must have a length of at least 3 characters.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the function should only return true if the string's length is at least 3.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'distinct': means that every 3 consecutive characters in the string must be different.\n    Explanation: This adverb is used to ensure that no character repeats within any 3 consecutive positions in the string.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function 'is_happy', we need to:\n    1. Check if the string length is at least 3.\n    2. Iterate through the string and check every 3 consecutive characters to ensure they are distinct.\n    3.
