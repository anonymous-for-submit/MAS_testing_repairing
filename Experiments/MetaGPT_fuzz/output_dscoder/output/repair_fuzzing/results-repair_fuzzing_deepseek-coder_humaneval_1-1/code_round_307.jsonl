{"task_id": "HumanEval/41", "prompt": "def car_race_collision(n: int):\t\n'''Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. There are n vehicles traveling from left to right, and at the same time, another different n vehicles are moving from right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nThis function outputs the number of such collisions.\n'''",

We will leverage the Pygame library for handling the graphical user interface and game mechanics. Pygame is well-suited for creating games and simulations due to its ease of use and robust feature set.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'car race collision': This involves simulating the interaction between two sets of vehicles moving in opposite directions on a straight road.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is the simulation of a physical scenario where objects (cars) moving in opposite directions collide without any change in their trajectory due to their strength.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the car race collision simulation, we will use Pygame, a Python library designed for game development and multimedia applications. The steps include setting up the graphical window, defining the properties of the cars, and animating their movement. We will use a loop to update the positions of the cars and check for collisions. When two cars collide, we will handle the collision by continuing their movement as if nothing happened.\n\n# [edge case] \n    car_race_collision(0) = No collision, no cars on the road\n    Explanation: If there are no cars (n=0), there can be no collisions. The expected output is a message indicating no cars on the road.\n    car_race_collision(-1) = Invalid input, negative number of cars\n    Explanation: A negative number of cars is not a valid input. The expected output is an error message indicating the input is invalid.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n < 0:\n            return \"Invalid input: number of cars cannot be negative.\"\n        elif n == 0:\n            return \"No cars on the road, no collisions possible.\"\n        (other code)\n\nThis additional code ensures that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function requires a simple mathematical calculation to determine the number of collisions based on the input of the number of cars. The primary challenge lies in ensuring the function is efficient and can handle large inputs without performance issues.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the number of collisions based on the input.\n- The function should be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- The code should be well-documented and easy to understand for future maintenance and updates.\nTo create a function that calculates the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions, we will use a straightforward approach. The function will take an integer input representing the number of cars and return the number of collisions. Given that the cars move at the same speed and are infinitely strong, the number of collisions will always be equal to the number of cars. This is because each car from the left will collide with a car from the right, and the total number of cars is the same on both sides.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'collision': The interaction between two vehicles moving in opposite directions, where they pass through each other without affecting their trajectory.\n    Explanation: In this scenario, each vehicle from the left will collide with a vehicle from the right, resulting in a direct pass without any change in their direction or speed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function `car_race_collision(n: int)` will simply return the value of `n` as the number of collisions. This is because each car from the left will collide with a car from the right, and the total number of cars is the same on both sides.\n\n# [edge case] \n    car_race_collision(0) = 0\n    Explanation: If there are no cars, there can be no collisions. The function should return 0 in this case.\n    car_race_collision(1) = 1\n    Explanation: With only one car on each side, there will be exactly one collision when the car from the left meets the car from the right.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the case where `n` is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge case where `n` is 0.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0109], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [92, 92, 92, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    Calculates the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The number of collisions.\n    '''\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    return n\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 3, "round": 307, "repair_prompt": ["def car_race_collision(n: int):\t\n'''Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
