This involves checking if `n` is even and if it can be divided into four even parts, each greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly': means that we need exactly four even numbers.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"exactly\" indicates that we need to find a solution where the sum of four even numbers equals `n`.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'positive': means that all even numbers must be greater than zero.\n    Explanation: The adverb \"positive\" specifies that each of the four even numbers must be greater than zero.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we need to check if `n` is even and then determine if it can be divided into four even parts, each greater than zero. This can be done by checking if `n` is divisible by 4 and greater than 0.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(2) = False\n    Explanation: The number 2 is not even, so it cannot be expressed as the sum of four even numbers.

This involves checking if n is an even number and if it can be divided into four even parts. The function should be efficient and handle edge cases such as very small or very large numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should accurately determine if a number can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n- The function should be efficient and capable of handling a wide range of inputs.\n- The function should provide clear and concise results.\n- The function should be easy to integrate into other applications.\n- The function should handle edge cases effectively.\nTo implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the mathematical properties of even numbers.
