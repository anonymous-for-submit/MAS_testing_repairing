This method is efficient and suitable for handling large arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindromic array': an array that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n    Explanation: In this context, a palindromic array means that for any given array, if we reverse the order of its elements, the result will be identical to the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of changes needed.\n    2. Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the array and the other at the end.\n    3. Compare the elements at these two pointers.\n    4. If the elements are not equal, increment the counter.\n    5. Move the pointers towards the center of the array.\n    6. Continue this process until the pointers meet in the middle.\n    7. Return the counter as the minimum number of changes needed.\n\n# [edge case] \n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) = 0\n    Explanation: The array is already palindromic, so no changes are needed.\n    smallest_change([1]) = 0\n    Explanation: The array contains only one element, so it is trivially palindromic.\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 4\n    Explanation: The array is not palindromic, and we need to change 4 elements to make it palindromic.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan already covers the edge cases where the array is already palindromic or contains only one element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic. The function should handle edge cases such as already palindromic arrays and arrays with a single element. The solution should be efficient and provide a clear, user-friendly interface for the user.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently determine the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.\n- The function should handle edge cases where the array is already palindromic or contains only one element.\n- The application should provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nTo create a function that calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we will use a simple and efficient approach. We will iterate through the array from both ends towards the center, comparing elements and counting the number of changes needed to make the array symmetric. This method ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum changes required.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindromic array': an array that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n    'minimum changes': the smallest number of modifications needed to transform the array into a palindrome.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `smallest_change(arr)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
