{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The next term is found by taking 3 times the previous term and then adding 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nNote: \n1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only

The Collatz conjecture is a sequence that involves starting with any positive integer n and repeatedly applying a specific set of operations to get the next term. If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should generate the Collatz sequence for the given number n.\n- The sequence should include only odd numbers.\n- The results should be sorted in ascending order.\n- The function should be efficient and fast.\nTo implement the function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that generates the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n, we will follow these steps: \n1. Generate the Collatz sequence starting from n.\n2. Filter out the odd numbers from the sequence.\n3. Sort the filtered odd numbers in ascending order.\n4. Return the sorted list of odd numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Collatz sequence': A sequence of numbers generated by starting with a positive integer n and repeatedly applying the following rules: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The logic to generate the Collatz sequence and filter out odd numbers naturally handles cases where the sequence does not produce any odd numbers or where the sequence is very short.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that generates the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n. The sequence starts with n and follows the rules: if the term is even, divide it by 2; if the term is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The function should return a sorted list of these odd numbers. The Collatz conjecture states that every positive integer will eventually reach 1 if the process is repeated indefinitely.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Collatz sequence generation\n- Filter out odd numbers from the sequence\n- Sort the list of odd numbers\n- Ensure the function is efficient\n- Include comments for better code readability\nTo implement the function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that generates the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n, we will follow these steps: \n1.
