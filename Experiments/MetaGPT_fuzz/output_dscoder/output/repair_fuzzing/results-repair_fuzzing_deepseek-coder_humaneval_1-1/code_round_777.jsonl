Since 1 is less than 10, it cannot be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(10) = True\n    Explanation: 10 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers: 2+4+2+2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to cover these cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if a given integer n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers. This is a straightforward mathematical problem that can be solved by checking if n is divisible by 4 and greater than or equal to 8. The function should return True if n meets these conditions, and False otherwise.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly implement the logic to check if n can be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and handles edge cases, such as very small values of n.\n- Implement a clear and user-friendly interface for the function.\nTo solve the problem of determining if a given integer n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers, we can use a straightforward mathematical approach. The key insight is that any even number can be expressed as the sum of two even numbers, and thus, four positive even integers. Therefore, the function should check if n is greater than or equal to 8 and divisible by 4. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of even integers': means the total of four positive even numbers\n\n    Explanation: The requirement is to determine if a given integer n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers. This involves summing four even numbers to see if their total equals the given integer n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly four': means we need to use four positive even integers for the sum\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Check if `n` is greater than or equal to 8.\n    2. Check if `n` is divisible by 4.\n    3. If both conditions are met, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(2) = False\n    Explanation: The smallest sum of four positive even integers is 2*4 = 8. Since 2 is less than 8, it cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(7) = False\n    Explanation: The smallest sum of four positive even integers is 8. Since 7 is less than 8, it cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(10) = False\n    Explanation: While 10 is greater than 8, it is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
