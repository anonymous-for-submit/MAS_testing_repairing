The function should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need. The input parameters are the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed for the day, and the number of carrots remaining. The output should be a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the eat function to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and remaining.\n- Ensure the function handles cases where the remaining carrots are less than the need.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy input and output display.\nTo implement the 'eat' function, we will use Python's built-in data types and standard library functions. The function will take three parameters: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed for the day, and the number of carrots remaining. It will calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after meals, ensuring that if there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, the rabbit will eat all remaining carrots. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the process of eating a certain number of carrots to meet a daily requirement, with the possibility of not having enough to fully satisfy the need.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': implies that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Check if the number of carrots already eaten plus the remaining carrots is enough to meet the need.\n    (2) If yes, calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after meals.\n    (3) If not, calculate the total number of carrots eaten as the sum of the number already eaten and the remaining carrots.\n    (4) Return the result as an array [total number of eaten carrots, the number of carrots left].\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 10) = [11, 4]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 5 carrots, needs 6 more, and has 10 remaining. The total eaten is 5 (already eaten) + 6 (needed) = 11, with 4 carrots left.\n    eat(4, 8, 3) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 4 carrots, needs 8 more, and has 3 remaining. The rabbit will eat all 3 remaining carrots, totaling 4 (already eaten) + 3 (remaining) = 7 carrots eaten, with 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already accounts for the scenario where the remaining carrots are less than the need.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount after meals. The function should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, in which case it should eat all available remaining carrots. Clarifications are needed to complete the example.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the eat function to calculate total carrots eaten and remaining.\n- Ensure the function handles cases where remaining carrots are insufficient.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting data.\n- Design a responsive layout for displaying results.\n- Test the application for accuracy and usability.\nWe will implement the 'eat' function using Python, ensuring it handles the calculation of total carrots eaten and remaining accurately. The function will take three parameters: 'number' (the number of carrots already eaten), 'need' (the number of carrots needed for the day), and 'remaining' (the number of carrots available). The function will return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten after meals and the number of carrots left after meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, the function will eat all available remaining carrots and return the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the act of eating carrots to fulfill a requirement or need.\n    Explanation: In this context, the core concept revolves around the act of a rabbit eating carrots to meet its dietary needs.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already consumed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': indicates a higher quantity of carrots needed compared to what has already been eaten.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb 'more' emphasizes the requirement to eat a greater quantity of carrots than the rabbit has already consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first check if the remaining carrots are enough to meet the need. If not, it should eat all available remaining carrots.\n    Steps:\n    1. Check if the remaining carrots are enough to meet the need.\n    2. If enough, calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.\n    3. If not enough, eat all remaining carrots and return the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 3) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has already eaten 5 carrots and needs 6 more. There are only 3 remaining carrots. The rabbit will eat all 3 remaining carrots, making a total of 8 carrots eaten, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(4, 8, 3) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has already eaten 4 carrots and needs 8 more. There are only 3 remaining carrots. The rabbit will eat all 3 remaining carrots, making a total of 7 carrots eaten, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 2) = [5, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has already eaten 3 carrots and needs 5 more. There are only 2 remaining carrots. The rabbit will eat all 2 remaining carrots, making a total of 5 carrots eaten, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    ```python\n    if need <= number:\n        return [number + remaining, 0]\n    else:\n        return [number + remaining, 0]\n    ```\n"], "scores": [0.2195, 1.0, 0.2195, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.2846, 0.0732, 1.0, 0.2846], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [27, 123, 27, 123, 0, 123, 35, 9, 123, 35], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef eat(number: int, need: int, remaining: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    The function takes three integers as input: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed for the day, and the number of carrots available.\n    It returns a list of two integers: the total number of carrots eaten after meals and the number of carrots left after meals.\n    \"\"\"\n    if need > number:\n        if remaining >= need - number:\n            total_eaten = number + (need - number)\n            remaining_carrots = remaining - (need - number)\n        else:\n            total_eaten = number + remaining\n            remaining_carrots = 0\n    else:\n        total_eaten = number + remaining\n        remaining_carrots = 0\n    return [total_eaten, remaining_carrots]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 135, "repair_prompt": ["def eat(number, need, remaining):\t\n'''You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots, but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
