Initialize a list to store Fibonacci numbers with the first two values (0 and 1).\n    2. Iterate from 2 to n, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n    3. Return the n-th Fibonacci number from the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fib(0) = 0\n    Explanation: By definition, the 0-th Fibonacci number is 0.\n    fib(1) = 1\n    Explanation: By definition, the 1st Fibonacci number is 1.\n    fib(11) = 89\n    Explanation: The 11th Fibonacci number is the sum of the 10th and 9th numbers in the sequence, which are 55 and 34 respectively.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the function can directly return the precomputed values for 0 and 1.
