If two numbers have the same count of ones, they should be sorted by their decimal value. This requirement is clear and specific, focusing on a unique sorting criterion that differentiates it from general sorting tasks.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.\n- Sort the array based on the count of ones in the binary representation.\n- Ensure that numbers with the same count of ones are sorted by their decimal value.\n- Handle both positive and negative numbers correctly.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and can handle large arrays.\nTo implement the function `sort_array` as described, we need to follow these steps: First, we will create a helper function to count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number. Then, we will use this helper function to sort the array based on the count of ones in the binary representation. For numbers with the same count of ones, we will sort them by their decimal value. We will ensure that the function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly by first converting them to their absolute values for the counting process and then applying the sorting logic. The function will be efficient and able to handle large arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary representation': the way numbers are represented in base 2 using only 0s and 1s.\n    Explanation: In computing, most data is stored in binary form, where each digit represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number '101' represents 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5 in decimal.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find numbers with a count of ones greater than a certain threshold.\n    Explanation: For instance, \"more than two ones\" would refer to numbers with a binary representation containing more than two 1s.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing': means that the order should go from the smallest to the largest.\n    Explanation: In the context of sorting, 'increasing order' means that the elements should be arranged from the lowest to the highest value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function `sort_array`, we need to:\n    1. Convert each number to its binary representation.\n    2. Count the number of ones in the binary representation.\n    3. Sort the array based on the count of ones, and by the number itself if counts are equal.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: The array contains only one element, which is 0. The binary representation of 0 is '0', and it has 0 ones.
