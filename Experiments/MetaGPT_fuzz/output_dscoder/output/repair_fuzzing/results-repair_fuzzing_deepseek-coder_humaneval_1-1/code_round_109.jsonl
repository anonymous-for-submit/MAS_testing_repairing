Find the indices of planet1 and planet2 in the list.\n    4. Extract the sublist of planets between these indices.\n    5. Sort the sublist based on their positions in the solar system.\n    6. Return the sorted sublist as a tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_planets(\"Earth\", \"Mars\") = ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth')\n    Explanation: The function should return the planets between Earth and Mars, including Earth but not Mars, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.\n    get_planets(\"Pluto\", \"Earth\") = ()\n    Explanation: Pluto is not a planet, so the function should return an empty tuple.\n    get_planets(\"Mars\", \"Mars\") = ()\n    Explanation: If planet1 and planet2 are the same, the function should return an empty tuple.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where one or both of the input planet names are not valid.\n    def get_planets(planet1, planet2):\n        planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']\n        if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n            return ()\n        index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n        index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n        if index1 == index2:\n            return ()\n        if index1 > index2:\n            index1, index2 = index2, index1\n        return tuple(planets[index1+1:index2])\n\n    This code checks if the input planet names are valid and handles the case where planet1 and planet2 are the same or not valid.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to handle planet names correctly, return the correct planets between the given two, and handle edge cases like same or adjacent planets. It should also return an empty tuple if the input planet names are not correct.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly identify and return the planets between the given two.\n- The function should handle edge cases where planets are the same or adjacent.\n- The function should return an empty tuple if the input planet names are not correct.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and handles a wide range of inputs.\nWe will use Python's built-in data structures and a simple list to represent the planets in the solar system. The function will first validate the input planet names, then find the index of these planets in the list, and finally return the planets between them, sorted by their proximity to the sun.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planets in the solar system'\n    The core concept refers to the eight planets that orbit the sun in our solar system, specifically named Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf('Earth', 'Mars') = ('Mercury', 'Venus')\n    Explanation: The function should return the planets between Earth and Mars, which are Mercury and Venus.\n    bf('Mars', 'Earth') = ('Mercury', 'Venus')\n    Explanation: The function should return the planets between Mars and Earth, which are Mercury and Venus, considering the order of the planets.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
