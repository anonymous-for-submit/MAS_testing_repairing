This is because \\(2^{100}\\) modulo 101 is 1.\n    modp(1101, 101) = 2\n    Explanation: When \\(2^{1101}\\) is divided by 101, the result is 2. This is because \\(2^{1101}\\) modulo 101 is 2.\n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(2^0\\) is divided by 101, the result is 1. This is because \\(2^0\\) is 1, and 1 modulo 101 is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The `pow` function in Python already handles the case when `n` is 0 efficiently.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'modular arithmetic'\n    Explanation: Modular arithmetic deals with the remainder when one number is divided by another. In this case, we are interested in finding the remainder when \\(2^n\\) is divided by \\(p\\).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n, p)`, we can use Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments. This function computes \\((base^exp) \\% mod\\) efficiently. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    ```python\n    def modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n        return pow(2, n, p)\n    ```\n\n    This function uses the `pow` method which is optimized for large numbers and directly computes the remainder.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(100, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(2^{100}\\) is divided by 101, the result is 1. This is because \\(2^{100}\\) modulo 101 is 1.\n    modp(1101, 101) = 2\n    Explanation: When \\(2^{1101}\\) is divided by 101, the result is 2. This is because \\(2^{1101}\\) modulo 101 is 2.\n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(2^0\\) is divided by 101, the result is 1. This is because \\(2^0\\) is 1, and 1 modulo 101 is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
