This is a specific task that requires careful handling of the input string to ensure that the output is accurate and meets the user's expectations.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to sort characters in each word alphabetically.\n- Ensure that spaces and punctuation are preserved in their original positions.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large strings efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy input and output display.\nTo implement the 'anti_shuffle' function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle string manipulation efficiently. The function will split the input string into words, sort the characters in each word alphabetically, and then reassemble the words back into the original sentence structure, preserving spaces and punctuation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'string manipulation': handling strings by breaking them into words, sorting characters within words, and then reassembling them.\n    Explanation: The core concept involves manipulating the string to rearrange characters in each word in ascending order while preserving the original structure of the sentence, including spaces and punctuation.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the 'anti_shuffle' function, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
