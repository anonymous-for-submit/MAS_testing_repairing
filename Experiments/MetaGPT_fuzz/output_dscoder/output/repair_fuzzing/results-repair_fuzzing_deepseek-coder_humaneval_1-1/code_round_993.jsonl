The function should be efficient and easy to understand.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check the condition and return the correct index.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance.\n- Document the function clearly for easy understanding and maintenance.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\n- Optimize the code for readability and efficiency.\nTo implement the function efficiently and ensure clarity, we will use Python's built-in functions and standard library features. The function will iterate through the array, comparing each element with the one before it, and keep track of the index where the condition is violated. This approach leverages Python's simplicity and readability while maintaining efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'largest index': means the highest position in the array where the condition is not met.\n    'distinct values': means each element in the array is unique.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1\n    explanation: The array is in strictly increasing order, so no element is greater than or equal to the one before it. Therefore, the function should return -1.\n    can_arrange([3,1,2]) = 1\n    explanation: The element at index 1 (value 1) is not greater than or equal to the element at index 0 (value 3), making it the largest index where this condition is not met.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic will correctly return -1 for the case of a strictly increasing array.\n"], "scores": [0.4245, 0.4245, 0.4245, 0.4245, 1.0, 0.4245, 1.0, 1.0, 0.4245, 0.4245], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, true, true, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [45, 45, 45, 45, 106, 45, 106, 106, 45, 45], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef can_arrange(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks the largest index where the condition is violated in a given list of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: An integer representing the largest index where the condition is violated, or -1 if the condition is never violated.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return -1\n    \n    index = -1\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:\n            index = i\n            break\n    \n    return index\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 3, "round": 993, "repair_prompt": ["def can_arrange(arr):\t\n'''Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.
