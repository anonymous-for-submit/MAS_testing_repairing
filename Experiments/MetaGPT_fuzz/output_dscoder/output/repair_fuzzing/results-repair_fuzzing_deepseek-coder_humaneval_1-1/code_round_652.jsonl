This requirement is clear and specific, focusing on a single sorting criterion that is both unique and practical.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement sorting algorithm to handle non-negative integers based on binary representation.\n- Ensure the sorting is efficient and can handle arrays of various sizes.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and understanding.\n- Design a visually appealing UI to enhance user experience.\nTo implement the sorting of an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation, we will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities along with a custom key function. This approach will ensure both efficiency and clarity in the sorting process. The custom key function will count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number, and in case of a tie, it will sort based on the decimal value.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary representation': the way numbers are represented in base 2 using only 0s and 1s.\n    Explanation: In computing, binary is the number system used to represent data in a computer, where each digit represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number '101' represents 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5 in decimal.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to compare the number of ones in the binary representation of numbers.\n    Explanation: For instance, in the requirement, we need to find numbers that appear more than once in their binary representation.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending order': means that we sort the numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n    Explanation: This is a common term used in mathematics and programming to describe the order in which numbers are arranged, starting from the smallest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the sorting based on the number of ones in the binary representation, we can use Python's `sorted()` function with a custom key. This key will count the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number using the `bin()` function and `count('1')` method. If two numbers have the same number of '1's, they will be sorted based on their decimal value.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: The edge case here is a single-element array.

The solution should be efficient and scalable to handle large datasets.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a custom sorting algorithm that sorts based on the number of ones in the binary representation.\n- Ensure the algorithm can handle negative numbers by modifying the input array to be non-negative.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance, especially for large datasets.\n- Test the algorithm with various edge cases to ensure accuracy.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python, ensuring readability and maintainability.\nTo implement the sorting algorithm as described, we will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities along with a custom key function that calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of each number. This approach leverages Python's efficiency and the ability to handle large datasets effectively. The custom key function will be used to sort primarily by the binary representation's number of ones and secondarily by the decimal value for numbers with the same number of ones.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n ## Prompt 3:\n\n[requirement]\n```python\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    '''In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to the number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order, and for similar numbers of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\n    It must be implemented like this:\n    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n    '''\n```\n\n[plan]\n```python\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      \"Convert each integer to its binary representation\",\n      \"Count the number of ones in the binary representation\",\n      \"Sort the array based on the count of ones and then by the decimal value for ties\"\n    ],\n    \"steps\": [\n      \"Get the input array from the user\",\n      \"Define a custom key function that returns a tuple (count of ones, decimal value) for each number\",\n      \"Use Python's built-in sorting function with the custom key function to sort the array\",\n      \"Return the sorted array\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'binary representation': means the representation of a number in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically 0 and 1.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    ```python\n    def sort_array(arr):\n        def count_ones(n):\n            return bin(n).count('1')\n        \n        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))\n    ```\n\n# [edge case]\n    sort_array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    Explanation: All numbers have a single digit in their binary representation, so the sorting is based solely on the decimal value.\n\n    sort_array([7, 8, 9]) = [7, 8, 9]\n    Explanation: The binary representations of 7, 8, and 9 are 111, 1000, and 1001, respectively.
