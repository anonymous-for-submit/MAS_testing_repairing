The function will be case-insensitive, counting both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n\n# [edge case] \n    vowels_count(\"y\") = 1\n    Explanation: Since 'y' is considered a vowel when it appears at the end of the word, the function should return 1 for the input \"y\".\n    vowels_count(\"Y\") = 1\n    Explanation: The function should be case-insensitive, so it should count 'Y' as a vowel, resulting in an output of 1.\n    vowels_count(\"hello\") = 2\n    Explanation: The string \"hello\" contains two vowels: 'e' and 'o'. The function should count both and return 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

The function should consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' as vowels, and 'y' as a vowel only when it appears at the end of the word. This requirement is clear and concise, focusing on a specific functionality.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately count the number of vowels in the input string.\n- Implement the logic to consider 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word.\n- Ensure the function is case-insensitive, counting both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\nWe will use a straightforward approach to implement the vowels_count function. The function will iterate through the input string, check each character against a set of vowels, and count the occurrences. Special handling will be added for 'y' to ensure it is only counted if it appears at the end of the word.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'vowels': 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n    Explanation: The core concept here is identifying and counting the vowels in a given string.

'y' is at the end of the word, so it is counted as a vowel.\n    vowels_count(\"sky\") = 1\n    Explanation: The only vowel in \"sky\" is 'y', but since it is at the end of the word, it is counted as a vowel.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
