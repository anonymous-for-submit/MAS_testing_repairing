We will define a helper function to check if a number is prime and then use this function to find three prime factors of the given number. The function will be optimized to work efficiently within the constraint of numbers less than 100.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'multiplication of 3 prime numbers': means the product of three prime numbers equals the given number.\n    'prime number': a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'multiplication of': indicates that we need to find three prime numbers whose product equals the given number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No specific degree adverbs are mentioned in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_multiply_prime(a)`, we need to:\n    1. Define a helper function `is_prime(n)` to check if a number `n` is prime.\n    2. Iterate through numbers less than 100 to find three prime numbers whose product equals `a`.\n    3. Return `True` if such a combination is found, otherwise return `False`.\n\n    Here's a possible implementation:\n    ```python\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def is_multiply_prime(a):\n        if a >= 100:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, 100):\n            if not is_prime(i):\n                continue\n            for j in range(i, 100):\n                if not is_prime(j):\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j, 100):\n                    if is_prime(k) and i * j * k == a:\n                        return True\n        return False\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_multiply_prime(1) = False\n    Explanation: 1 is not a product of three prime numbers.\n    is_multiply_prime(30) = True\n    Explanation: 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, which is the product of three prime numbers.\n    is_multiply_prime(105) = False\n    Explanation: 105 is greater than 100, so it does not meet the constraint.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the function already checks if `a` is less than 100. If `a` is greater than or equal to 100, the function returns `False` immediately.\n"], "scores": [0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.7679, 1.0, 0.8393, 0.8393], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 43, 56, 47, 47], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a product of three prime numbers.\"\"\"\n    if a >= 100:\n        return False\n    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]\n    for i in range(len(primes)):\n        for j in range(i, len(primes)):\n            for k in range(j, len(primes)):\n                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Output: True\n# print(is_multiply_prime(105)) # Output: False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 469, "repair_prompt": ["def is_multiply_prime(a):\t\n'''Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.
