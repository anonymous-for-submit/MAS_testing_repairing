Join the numbers into a single string with spaces in between.\n    4. Return the resulting string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    Explanation: When `n` is 0, the function should return the string '0' as there is only one number in the sequence.\n    string_sequence(5) = '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    Explanation: When `n` is 5, the function should return the string '0 1 2 3 4 5' as it includes all numbers from 0 to 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge cases since the logic provided in the plan already handles them correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements are clear and concise, asking for a function that generates a string listing numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces. This is a basic functionality that can be enhanced with additional features like user interface improvements and mobile compatibility.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately generate the string sequence as per the requirement.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for better user experience.\n- Ensure the product is optimized for mobile devices.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a simple function that generates a string listing numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces. This approach will be efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's simplicity and readability.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence': means a list of numbers in order from 0 to n.\n    'including': means the number n is included in the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests creating a function that generates a string listing numbers from 0 to n. This can be achieved using a simple loop or Python's list comprehension.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the sequence consists of only the number 0, so the output is '0'.\n    string_sequence(-1) = ''\n    Explanation: If n is negative, there are no numbers to include in the sequence, so the output is an empty string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure n is not negative, and return an empty string if it is.\n        if n < 0:\n            return ''\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a string listing numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string listing numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return ''\n    \n    sequence = [str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    return ' '.join(sequence)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 722, "repair_prompt": ["def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string that lists numbers separated by spaces, starting at 0 and going up to and including n.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    '''Return a string that lists numbers separated by spaces, starting at 0 and going up to and including n.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''\n", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    '''Return a string that lists numbers separated by spaces, starting at 0 and going up to and including n.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 130}
