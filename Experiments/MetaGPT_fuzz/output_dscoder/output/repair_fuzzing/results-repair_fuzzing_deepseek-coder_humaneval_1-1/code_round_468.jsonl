The function needs to handle both small and large values of n efficiently, avoiding recursion to prevent stack overflow and improve performance. The function should be clear and optimized for readability and execution speed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Fib4 sequence computation without recursion.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for large values of n.\n- Provide clear and readable code for educational purposes.\n- Test the function for accuracy and performance.\nTo implement the Fib4 sequence computation efficiently without recursion, we will use an iterative approach with a dynamic programming technique. This method will store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance for large values of n. We will also ensure the function is optimized for readability and execution speed, making it suitable for both technical and non-technical users.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Fib4 sequence': This is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but includes four initial values and a different recurrence relation.\n    Explanation: The Fib4 sequence starts with fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, fib4(3) = 0, and for n >= 4, it follows the rule fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the value of an integer in the sequence is greater than a certain threshold.\n    Explanation: In the Fib4 sequence, the value of an integer is compared to the sum of the previous four values.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the value of an integer in the sequence is the biggest compared to the previous values.\n    Explanation: In the Fib4 sequence, the largest integer is the one with the highest value among the first few elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence without using recursion, we can use an iterative approach with a dynamic programming technique.
