The function will handle negative numbers by considering their absolute value. The implementation will be efficient and suitable for large numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even and odd digits'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the count of digits that are divisible by 2 (even) and those that are not (odd) in a given integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Convert the integer to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.\n    (2) Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit.\n    (3) Initialize counters for even and odd digits.\n    (4) Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the integer.\n    (5) Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter.\n    (6) Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 has one even digit (0) and no odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(13579) = (0, 5)\n    Explanation: The number 13579 has no even digits and five odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(-24680) = (4, 1)\n    Explanation: The number -24680 has four even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) and one odd digit (0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the logic already covers the case where the number is 0.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5316, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 42, 79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef even_odd_count(num: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    '''Given an integer, return a tuple that contains the count of digits that are even and odd, respectively.\n    Example:\n            even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n            even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''\n    # Convert the integer to its absolute value\n    num = abs(num)\n    \n    # Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit\n    num_str = str(num)\n    \n    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the integer\n    for char in num_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        # Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter\n        if digit % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits\n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 310, "repair_prompt": ["def even_odd_count(num):\t\n'''Given an integer, return a tuple that contains the count of digits that are even and odd, respectively.\nExample:\n        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''", " def even_odd_count(num):\t\n'''Given an integer, return a tuple that contains the count of digits that are even and odd, respectively.\nExample:\n        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n        even_odd_count(0) ==> (1, 0)\n    '''", " def even_odd_count(num):\n    '''Given an integer, return a tuple that contains the count of digits that are even and odd, respectively.\n    Example:\n            even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n            even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 251}
