The output should also be an empty list.\n    incr_list([-1, -2, -3]) = [0, -1, -2]\n    Explanation: The list contains negative numbers.

It then iterates through the dictionary to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number.\n\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears twice, and number 4 appears three times. None of them appear more than or equal to their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
