The phrase 'more than' is used to specify that the integers must be greater than zero.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the biggest integer that appears greater or equal to its value.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'largest' indicates that we need to find the integer with the highest value that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should:\n    1. Check if the list is empty or has only one element.\n    2. Iterate through the list of coefficients to compute the derivative.\n    3. Return the resulting list of coefficients representing the derivative.\n\n# [edge case] \n    derivative([]) = []\n    Explanation: If the input list is empty, the derivative of a constant polynomial is zero, so the output should be an empty list.\n    derivative([5]) = []\n    Explanation: If the input list has only one element, the derivative of a linear polynomial is zero, so the output should be an empty list.\n    derivative([2, 3]) = [3]\n    Explanation: The derivative of the polynomial 2 + 3x is 3, so the output should be [3].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(xs) == 0:\n            return []\n        elif len(xs) == 1:\n            return []\n"], "scores": [0.9899, 0.9899, 0.0303, 0.9899, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9899, 0.9899, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [98, 98, 3, 98, 99, 99, 99, 98, 98, 99], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef derivative(xs: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients.\n    \n    Args:\n        xs (list): A list of coefficients representing the polynomial.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(xs) == 0:\n        return []\n    elif len(xs) == 1:\n        return []\n    else:\n        return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 805, "repair_prompt": ["def derivative(xs: list):\t\n'''xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.\n    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....\n     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n     Consider edge cases such as an empty list or a list with one element.\n>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n    [1, 4, 12, 20]\n    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 6]\n    '''", " def derivative(xs: list):\t\n    '''xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.\n        xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....\n         Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n         Consider edge cases such as an empty list or a list with one element.\n    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n        [1, 4, 12, 20]\n        >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n        [2, 6]\n", " def derivative(xs: list):\n    '''xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.\n        xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....\n         Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n         Consider edge cases such as an empty list or a list with one element.\n    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n        [1, 4, 12, 20]\n        >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n        [2, 6]\n       "], "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 50}
