Then, it will check if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character removal': The process of deleting specific characters from a string.\n    'palindrome check': The process of verifying if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Remove all characters from 's' that are present in 'c'.\n    (2) Check if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n    (3) Return the result string and the boolean value indicating whether it is a palindrome.\n\n# [edge case] \n    reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\") = ('bcd', False)\n    Explanation: The characters 'a' and 'e' are removed from \"abcde\", resulting in \"bcd\".
