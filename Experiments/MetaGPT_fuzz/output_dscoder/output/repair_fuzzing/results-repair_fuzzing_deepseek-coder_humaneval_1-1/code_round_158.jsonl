You need to check if an exchange of elements between the lists can make lst1 consist solely of even numbers. Your task is basically a challenge to ensure lst1 contains only even integers. There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be
