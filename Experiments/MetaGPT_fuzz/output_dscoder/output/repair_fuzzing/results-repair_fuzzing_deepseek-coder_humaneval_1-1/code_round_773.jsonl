The challenge lies in implementing this sequence iteratively to avoid the inefficiencies of recursion. The function should handle both small and large values of n efficiently, ensuring minimal memory usage and optimal performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Fib4 sequence iteratively.\n- Ensure the function can handle large values of n efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise documentation for educational purposes.\n- Include unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.\n- Optimize the function for memory usage.\nTo implement the Fib4 sequence efficiently without using recursion, we will use an iterative approach. This method will avoid the potential pitfalls of recursion, such as stack overflow for large values of n. We will use a list to store the sequence values, updating each value based on the previous four values as per the Fib4 sequence definition. This approach ensures that the function can handle large values of n efficiently and with minimal memory usage.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Fib4 sequence': This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but is defined using the sum of the previous four elements instead of the previous two.\n    Explanation: The Fib4 sequence starts with 0, 0, 2, 0, and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous four elements. This sequence is defined iteratively without recursion.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find integers greater than a certain value.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, 'more than' is used to specify that the integer must appear more times than its value itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks for the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself, so 'largest' specifies that we need to find the biggest such integer.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, we will use an iterative approach:\n    1. Initialize a list to store the sequence values.\n    2. Set the first four values of the list according to the Fib4 sequence definition.\n    3. Iterate from 4 to n, updating each value based on the sum of the previous four values.\n    4. Return the n-th value from the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fib4(0) = 0\n    Explanation: By definition, fib4(0) is 0.\n    fib4(1) = 0\n    Explanation: By definition, fib4(1) is 0.\n    fib4(2) = 2\n    Explanation: By definition, fib4(2) is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as they are directly defined by the sequence rules. The initial values are set according to the sequence definition, and the iterative approach ensures that all values are computed correctly.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef fib4(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    Computes the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position in the sequence, starting from 0.\n    Returns:\n        int: The n-th Fib4 number.\n    '''\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 2\n    \n    # Initialize the sequence with the first four values\n    sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]\n    \n    # Compute the sequence up to the n-th element\n    for i in range(4, n + 1):\n        next_value = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3] + sequence[i - 4]\n        sequence.append(next_value)\n    \n    return sequence[n]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 773, "repair_prompt": ["def fib4(n: int):\t\n'''The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows: fib4(0) -> 0, fib4(1) -> 0, fib4(2) -> 2, fib4(3) -> 0, fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
