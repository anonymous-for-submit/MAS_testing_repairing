The provided logic already accounts for the case insensitivity and the presence of distinct characters.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case. This is a straightforward task that involves converting the string to lowercase, using a set to find distinct characters, and then returning the size of the set.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly count distinct characters in a string.\n- The function should be case-insensitive.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings.\n- The function should be optimized for performance.\nTo implement the function that counts the number of distinct characters in a given string while ignoring case, we will use Python's built-in capabilities. Specifically, we will convert the string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity, then use a set to collect distinct characters, and finally return the size of the set.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case-insensitive': means that the comparison of characters should be done without considering their case (uppercase or lowercase).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity.\n    (2) Use a set to store distinct characters.\n    (3) Iterate through the string and add each character to the set.\n    (4) Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('aAaA') = 1\n    explanation: The string contains only one distinct character 'a' regardless of its case.\n    count_distinct_characters('Python') = 5\n    explanation: The string contains five distinct characters 'P', 'y', 't', 'h', and 'o' when case is ignored.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
