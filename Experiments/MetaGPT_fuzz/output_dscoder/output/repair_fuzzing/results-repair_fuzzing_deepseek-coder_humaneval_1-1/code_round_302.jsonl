Our product aims to balance these aspects.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a median calculation method that handles both even and odd-numbered lists.\n- Ensure the median calculation is accurate and efficient.\n- Optimize the code for performance, especially for larger datasets.\n- Provide clear and concise documentation for the median calculation method.\nTo implement the median calculation method efficiently and accurately, we will utilize Python's built-in sorting capabilities, which are both simple and performant. This approach will ensure that the median calculation is handled correctly for both even and odd-numbered lists. We will also ensure that the solution is optimized for performance, making it suitable for handling larger datasets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'median': the middle value in a list of numbers; if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one; if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The provided plan is already detailed and follows a common approach to calculate the median:\n    1. Sort the list.\n    2. Check if the length of the list is odd or even.\n    3. If odd, return the middle element.\n    4. If even, return the average of the two middle elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    median([1, 3, 5]) = 3\n    explanation: The list has an odd number of elements, so the median is the middle element, which is 3.\n    median([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2.5\n    explanation: The list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle elements, which are 2 and 3, so the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.\n    median([7, 3, 1, 4, 2, 6]) = 3.5\n    explanation: After sorting the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7], the two middle elements are 3 and 4. The median is the average of these two numbers, which is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the provided logic to handle the edge cases, as the current implementation correctly handles lists with both even and odd numbers of elements.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the median of a list of numbers. The function should handle both even and odd-numbered lists appropriately. The solution should be efficient and easy to understand.
