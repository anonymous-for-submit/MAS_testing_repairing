This means that for increasing monotonicity, each element must be less than or equal to the next, and for decreasing monotonicity, each element must be greater than or equal to the next.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to implement the function:\n    1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return False since the function requires a non-empty list.\n    2. Initialize two boolean variables, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to True. These will track whether the list is monotonic increasing or decreasing.\n    3. Iterate through the list, comparing each element with the next.\n    4. If an element is found that is greater than the next, set `increasing` to False.\n    5. If an element is found that is less than the next, set `decreasing` to False.\n    6. If both `increasing` and `decreasing` are False at the end of the iteration, return False.\n    7. Otherwise, return True, indicating the list is monotonic.\n\n# [edge case] \n    monotonic([]) = False\n    Explanation: The list is empty, which violates the requirement that the list must be non-empty.
