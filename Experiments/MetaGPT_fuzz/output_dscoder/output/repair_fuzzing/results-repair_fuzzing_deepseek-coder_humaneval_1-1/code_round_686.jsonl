In this case, it means the highest level of rotation, which is achieved by multiplying the shift factor by 2.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the encryption function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Define the shift factor as 4 (2 * 2).\n    2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n    3. Check if the character is an uppercase or lowercase letter.\n    4. Shift the character by the defined shift factor.\n    5. Handle the wrap-around for both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n    6. Construct the encrypted string and return it.\n\n# [edge case] \n    encrypt('z') = 'b'\n    Explanation: Since 'z' is the last letter of the alphabet and shifting it by 4 positions would exceed the alphabet, we wrap around to the beginning. 'z' shifted by 4 positions is 'b'.\n    encrypt('Z') = 'B'\n    Explanation: Similarly, for uppercase letters, 'Z' shifted by 4 positions wraps around to 'B'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
