The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. A collision occurs when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. We define a collision as an encounter between two cars moving in opposite directions on the same road. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nThis function outputs the number of such collisions.\n'''",
