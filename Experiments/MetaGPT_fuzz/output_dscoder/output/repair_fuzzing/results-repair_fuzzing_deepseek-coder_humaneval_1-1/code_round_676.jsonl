The function will iterate through the array, comparing each element with the one before it, and keep track of the highest index where this condition is met. If no such element is found, the function will return -1.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'highest index': means the largest position in the array where an element is smaller than the element before it.\n    'not contain duplicate values': means each element in the array is unique.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.\n    Compare each element with the one before it.\n    Keep track of the highest index where an element is smaller than the one before it.\n    If no such element is found, return -1.\n\n# [edge case] \n    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1\n    explanation: There is no element in the array that is smaller than the element before it, so the expected output is -1.\n    can_arrange([3,2,1]) = 2\n    explanation: The element '1' is smaller than the element '2' at index 1, which is the highest index where this condition is met, so the expected output is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic will return -1 if no such element exists.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.1038, 1.0, 0.1038, 1.0, 0.1038, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1038, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, true, false, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [106, 11, 106, 11, 106, 11, 106, 106, 11, 106], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef can_arrange(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the highest index of an element in an array which is smaller than the element before it.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The highest index of an element that is smaller than the element right before it, or -1 if no such element exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    highest_index = -1\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:\n            highest_index = i\n    \n    return highest_index\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 676, "repair_prompt": ["def can_arrange(arr):\t\n'''Create a function which gives back the highest index of an element that is smaller than the element right before it.
