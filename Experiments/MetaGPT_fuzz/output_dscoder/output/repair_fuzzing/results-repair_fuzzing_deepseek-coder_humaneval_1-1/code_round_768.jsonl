The function will iterate through each word in the input sentence, check if the length of the word is a prime number, and then collect these words into a result string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime number': A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Define a helper function to check if a number is prime.\n    - Split the sentence into words.\n    - Iterate through each word, check if its length is a prime number.\n    - Collect the words that meet the criteria into a result list.\n    - Join the result list into a string with spaces.\n\n# [edge case] \n    words_in_sentence(\"hello world\") = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: The word \"hello\" has a length of 5, which is a prime number.
