The formula is n*(n+1)/2, which is a direct method to sum all integers from 1 to n.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: By definition, the sum of numbers from 1 to 0 is 0, as there are no numbers to add.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Since the input is a negative number, the function should return 0, as it doesn't make sense to sum numbers from 1 to a negative number in the context of this function.\n    sum_to_n(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is simply 1, as there is only one number in this range.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided formula already correctly handles the edge cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 0 and 1 respectively. For negative numbers, the function naturally returns 0, which is the correct behavior.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers to sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input is not a positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 156, "repair_prompt": ["def sum_to_n(n: int):\t\n'''sum_to_n is a function that adds up numbers from 1 to n.\n>>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    '''", " def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    '''sum_to_n is a function that adds up numbers from 1 to n.\n    The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, inclusive.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)", " def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    '''sum_to_n is a function that adds up numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)\n        1\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 155}
