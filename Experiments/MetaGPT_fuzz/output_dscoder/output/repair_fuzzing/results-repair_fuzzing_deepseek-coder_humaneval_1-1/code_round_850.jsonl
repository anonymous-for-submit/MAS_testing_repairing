This method ensures that we find the largest prime factor efficiently. We will also handle edge cases where n is a prime number by returning n itself. The function will be optimized for large values of n to maintain performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime factor': A prime factor is a factor of a given number that is a prime number.

Here's a detailed logic:\n\n    1. Initialize the largest prime factor as -1.\n    2. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    3. Use a loop to divide n by the current prime number as long as it is divisible.\n    4. Update the largest prime factor whenever a new larger prime factor is found.\n    5.
