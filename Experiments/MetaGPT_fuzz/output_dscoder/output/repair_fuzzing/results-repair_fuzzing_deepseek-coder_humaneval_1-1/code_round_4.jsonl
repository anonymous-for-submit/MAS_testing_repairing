When the input list has one or more elements, it should insert the delimiter between each pair of elements.\n\n    Steps to implement:\n    1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n    2. If the list has elements, initialize an empty result list.\n    3.

Return the result list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    intersperse([1], 4) = [1]\n    Explanation: Since the list contains only one element, no delimiter should be added. The expected output is the list itself.\n    intersperse([], 4) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list should remain empty regardless of the delimiter. The expected output is an empty list.\n    intersperse([1, 2, 3, 4], 4) = [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: The delimiter is inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.
