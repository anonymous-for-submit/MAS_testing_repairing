The function should be efficient and easy to use, providing a seamless user experience.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly identify and return the planets between two given names, sorted by their proximity to the sun.\n- The function should handle incorrect planet names gracefully by returning an empty tuple.\n- The function should be easy to use and provide a clear output.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle a variety of inputs efficiently.\nWe will use Python's built-in data structures and a simple approach to handle the planet names and their order. The function will first validate the input planet names against a list of known planets. If valid, it will find the index of each planet, calculate the range between them, and return the planets in that range sorted by their proximity to the sun.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planet names': The core concept here is identifying and comparing planet names based on their order in the solar system.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that there are eight planets in the solar system, and we need to compare the positions of two given planets to find the ones between them, sorted by their proximity to the sun.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find planets that appear after a given planet in the list.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" is used to specify that we need to find planets that come after the first planet in the comparison.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'closerst': Indicates the first planet in the list.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"closerst\" refers to the first planet in the sequence, which is Mercury.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first validate the input planet names. If valid, it should find the indices of the given planets, determine the range between them, and return the planets in that range sorted by their proximity to the sun.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf(\"Pluto\", \"Mars\") = ()\n    Explanation: Since Pluto is not considered a planet by the IAU, the function should return an empty tuple if either planet1 or planet2 is not a valid planet name.\n    bf(\"Earth\", \"Pluto\") = ()\n    Explanation: Similarly, if the planet names are not valid or if planet2 comes before planet1 in the list, the function should return an empty tuple.\n    bf(\"Mars\", \"Mars\") = ()\n    Explanation: If planet1 and planet2 are the same, there are no planets between them, so the function should return an empty tuple.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the input planet names are not valid or if planet1 and planet2 are the same.\n    Example code:\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    if planet1 == planet2:\n        return ()\n    (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8725, 1.0, 0.5392, 1.0, 0.5392, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 89, 102, 55, 102, 55, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef bf(planet1: str, planet2: str) -> tuple:\n    '''\n    :param planet1: str\n    :param planet2: str\n    :return: tuple of planet names sorted by their proximity to the sun\n    '''\n    \n    # List of known planets in the solar system\n    planets = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n    \n    # Validate the input planet names\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    # Find the indices of the given planets\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    # Handle edge cases where the planets are the same or if the order is invalid\n    if planet1 == planet2:\n        return ()\n    if index1 > index2:\n        index1, index2 = index2, index1\n    \n    # Extract the planets in the range between planet1 and planet2\n    planets_in_range = planets[index1 + 1:index2]\n    \n    # Return the planets sorted by their proximity to the sun\n    return tuple(planets_in_range)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(bf(\"Mercury\", \"Mars\"))  # Output: ('Venus', 'Earth')\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 281, "repair_prompt": ["def bf(planet1, planet2):\t\n'''There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
