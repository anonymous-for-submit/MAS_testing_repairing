For a polynomial with coefficients xs, the derivative will have coefficients that are the original coefficients multiplied by their respective powers, with the power reduced by 1.\n\n# [edge case] \n    derivative([1]) = []\n    Explanation: If the polynomial has only one coefficient, the derivative of a constant is 0, so the result should be an empty list.\n    derivative([0, 1, 2, 3]) = [1, 4, 12]\n    Explanation: The derivative of a polynomial with leading coefficient 0 is obtained by differentiating the remaining polynomial. The leading zero coefficient does not affect the derivative.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic for calculating the derivative already correctly handles the case where the input list has only one element.\n\n# [code logic continued]\n    Here's a detailed implementation of the code logic:\n    ```python\n    def derivative(xs: list):\n        if len(xs) <= 1:\n            return []\n        return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n    ```\n    This function checks if the list has only one element or is empty, in which case it returns an empty list since the derivative of a constant is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the derivative by multiplying each coefficient by its respective power and returns the new list of coefficients.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.0303, 0.0303, 0.9899, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [99, 3, 3, 98, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef derivative(xs: list) -> list:\n    '''\n    Calculate the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients.\n    Args:\n        xs (list): List of coefficients where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i.\n    Returns:\n        list: List of coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n    '''\n    if len(xs) <= 1:\n        return []\n    return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 649, "repair_prompt": ["def derivative(xs: list):\t\n'''xs denote the coefficients of a polynomial.  \nxs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....  \nReturn the derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n    [1, 4, 12, 20]\n    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 6]\n    '''", " def derivative(xs: list):\t\n    '''xs denote the coefficients of a polynomial.  \n    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....  \n    Return the derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n    [1, 4, 12, 20]\n    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 6]\n    '''\n    if not xs:\n        return []\n", " def derivative(xs: list):\n    '''xs denote the coefficients of a polynomial.  \n    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....  \n    Return the derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n    [1, 4, 12, 20]\n    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 6]\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 50}
