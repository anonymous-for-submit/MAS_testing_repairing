{"task_id": "HumanEval/127", "prompt": "def intersection(interval1, interval2):\t\n'''You are given two intervals, where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2). The given intervals are closed, meaning that the interval (start, end) includes both start and end, and for each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal to its end. Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two intervals is a prime number. Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1, which not a prime number. If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\", otherwise, return \"NO\". If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\nsamples:\n    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==>

If b < c or d < a, then the intervals do not intersect. Otherwise, the intersection is the interval (max(a, c), min(b, d)).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that the length of the intersection should be greater than a certain value.\n    Explanation: In the context of intervals, if the intersection length is more than a prime number, it means the length of the intersection should be greater than the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that the intersection length should be the largest possible within the given intervals.\n    Explanation: In the context of intervals, the largest intersection length would be the smallest of the two interval ends minus the largest of the two interval starts, if this value is positive.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function, we need to:\n    1.

Check if this length is a prime number.\n    Steps 1 and 2 can be done simultaneously by finding the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points of the two intervals, provided they intersect.\n\n# [edge case] \n    intersection((1, 5), (6, 10)) = -1\n    Explanation: The intervals (1, 5) and (6, 10) do not intersect, so the intersection length is not applicable. The function should return -1 to indicate no intersection.\n    intersection((1, 3), (2, 4)) = 2\n    Explanation: The intersection of (1, 3) and (2, 4) is (2, 3), which has a length of 1. However, since we are checking for prime length, the function should return -1 as 1 is not a prime number.\n    intersection((1, 2), (3, 4)) = -1\n    Explanation: The intervals (1, 2) and (3, 4) do not intersect, so the function should return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the intervals do not intersect.\n    (code for handling the edge case)\n    if interval1[1] < interval2[0] or interval2[1] < interval1[0]:\n        return -1  # No intersection\n    (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number.
