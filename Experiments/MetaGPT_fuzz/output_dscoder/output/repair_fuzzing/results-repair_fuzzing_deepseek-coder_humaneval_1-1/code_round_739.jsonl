We will iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly, and check if the balance ever goes below zero. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency without the need for complex libraries or frameworks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'bank account balance': the total amount of money in the account, which can be affected by deposits (positive numbers) and withdrawals (negative numbers).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to compare the balance with zero to see if it goes below zero.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'below zero': means that the balance is less than zero.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Initialize the balance to zero.\n    (2) Iterate through the list of operations.\n    (3) For each operation, update the balance.\n    (4) Check if the balance goes below zero at any point.\n    (5) Return True if the balance goes below zero, otherwise return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    below_zero([1, -1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance starts at zero, then becomes -1 after the first withdrawal, and then becomes -2 after the second withdrawal, which means it falls below zero.\n    below_zero([-1, -1, -1]) = True\n    Explanation: The balance starts at zero, and each withdrawal makes it go further below zero, so it falls below zero at the end of the operations.\n    below_zero([1, 1, 1]) = False\n    Explanation: The balance starts at zero, and each deposit keeps it at or above zero, so it never falls below zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles the cases where the balance goes below zero or not.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the balance goes below zero after a series of operations.\n\n    Args:\n        operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing operations.\n            Positive numbers represent deposits, and negative numbers represent withdrawals.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the balance goes below zero at any point, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0\n    \n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 739, "repair_prompt": ["def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\t\n'''You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
