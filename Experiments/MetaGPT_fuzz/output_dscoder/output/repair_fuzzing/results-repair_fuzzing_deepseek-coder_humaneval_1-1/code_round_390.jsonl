Calculate the absolute difference between each pair.\n    4. If any difference is less than the threshold, return `True`.\n    5. If no pairs are closer than the threshold, return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) = False\n    Explanation: The list contains numbers that are all at least 1.0 apart from each other, so no pair is closer than the given threshold of 0.5.\n    has_close_elements([], 0.5) = False\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no numbers to compare.\n    has_close_elements([1.0], 0.5) = False\n    Explanation: The list has only one element, so there are no pairs to compare.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
