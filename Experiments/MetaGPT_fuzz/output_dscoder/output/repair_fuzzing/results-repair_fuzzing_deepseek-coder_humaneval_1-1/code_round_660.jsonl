After collecting all coordinates, we will sort them first by rows in ascending order and then by columns in descending order.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'nested list': a list containing other lists as its elements.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, the input is a 2-dimensional data structure represented by a nested list, where each sublist can have a different number of elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times as': indicates that the frequency of the integer in the list should be considered.\n    Explanation: For example, if the integer is 2, it should appear at least 2 times in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the highest value among the integers that meet the condition.\n    Explanation: We need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Iterate through the list to find all occurrences of the integer.\n    - Store the coordinates of these occurrences.\n    - Sort the coordinates first by rows in ascending order, and then by columns in descending order.\n    - Return the sorted list of coordinates.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_row([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 5) = [(1, 1)]\n    Explanation: The integer 5 appears once in the list at row 1, column 1. Since there are no other integers to compare, it is automatically the largest.\n    get_row([], 1) = []\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no coordinates to return.\n    get_row([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]], 2) = [(0, 1)]\n    Explanation: The integer 2 appears once in the list at row 0, column 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the case where the list is empty.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'sliding window': a technique where you slide a window across a data structure to capture a subset of data.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, we use a sliding window to find overlapping occurrences of the substring within the original string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'overlapping instances': means that the substring can appear multiple times in a row, including when it overlaps with itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the string 'aaaa', the substring 'aa' appears three times, including overlapping occurrences.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Get the input string and substring from the user.\n    - Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of occurrences.\n    - Iterate through the original string using a sliding window approach.\n    - Check if the current substring matches the input substring.\n    - If a match is found, increment the counter variable.\n    - Return the final count of occurrences.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('ababab', 'aba') = 3\n    Explanation: The substring 'aba' appears three times in the original string 'ababab', including overlapping occurrences.\n    how_many_times('abc', 'd') = 0\n    Explanation: The substring 'd' does not appear in the original string 'abc', so the count is 0.\n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: The original string is empty, so the substring cannot appear, resulting in a count of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.6092, 0.9195, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [87, 87, 53, 80, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef get_row(lst: List[List[int]], x: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    '''\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    '''\n    coordinates = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to find all occurrences of the integer x\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):\n        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value == x:\n                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))\n    \n    # Sort the coordinates list by rows in ascending order, and by columns in descending order\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    \n    return coordinates\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 660, "repair_prompt": ["def get_row(lst, x):\t\n'''You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists, which is similar to matrix; however, unlike matrices, each row may contain a different number of columns.
