This approach leverages Python's efficient handling of large integers and avoids potential overflow issues by utilizing the modulus operation directly within the power calculation. The `pow` function in Python is optimized for such operations and ensures that the result is computed within the bounds of the modulus, thus preventing overflow.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'modulus operation': This is the operation of finding the remainder when one number is divided by another. In the context of the requirement, it is used to ensure that the result of the power operation does not exceed the value of `p`.\n\n    Explanation: The modulus operation is crucial in this function because it allows us to compute `2^n` modulo `p` efficiently, which is necessary to handle large values of `n` and to avoid overflow issues.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)`, we can use Python's built-in `pow` function with the modulus argument.

The third argument `p` in `pow(2, n, p)` ensures that the result is the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1101, 101) = 2\n    Explanation: The value of `2^1101` modulo `101` is computed efficiently using the `pow` function with the modulus argument. The result is 2, which is the remainder when `2^1101` is divided by `101`.\n\n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: Since any number to the power of 0 is 1, `2^0` modulo `101` is 1.\n\n    modp(3, 11) = 8\n    Explanation: The value of `2^3` modulo `11` is computed efficiently using the `pow` function with the modulus argument. The result is 8, which is the remainder when `2^3` is divided by `11`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed to handle the edge cases.

In this case, we are interested in finding \\(2^n \\mod p\\), which is the remainder when \\(2^n\\) is divided by \\(p\\).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)`, we can use Python's built-in `pow` function, which efficiently computes \\(a^b \\mod c\\) using an algorithm that handles large numbers and is optimized for modulus operations. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    1. Use the `pow` function with three arguments: `pow(2, n, p)`. This computes \\(2^n \\mod p\\) directly, which is efficient and avoids potential overflow issues.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(n = 0\\), \\(2^0 = 1\\). The modulo operation with any number \\(p\\) will result in 1, as 1 modulo \\(p\\) is always 1.\n    modp(100, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(n = 100\\), \\(2^{100} \\mod 101\\) results in 1. This is because \\(2^{100}\\) is a very large number, but due to the properties of modular arithmetic, the result is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The `pow` function in Python is designed to handle the edge case where \\(n = 0\\) efficiently and accurately.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    Return 2^n modulo p.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent.\n        p (int): The modulus.\n    Returns:\n        int: The result of 2^n modulo p.\n    '''\n    return pow(2, n, p)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 917, "repair_prompt": ["def modp(n: int, p: int):\t\n'''Return 2^n modulo p.
