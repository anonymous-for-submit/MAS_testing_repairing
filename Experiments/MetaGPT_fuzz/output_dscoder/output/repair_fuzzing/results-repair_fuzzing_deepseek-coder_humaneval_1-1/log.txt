Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list containing only the unique elements, sorted in ascending order. The function should preserve the order of appearance from the original list for the first occurrence of each element.

Function Signature: 
def sorted_unique_elements(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:

Input
- A list of integers `lst` where 0 <= len(lst) <= 1000

Output
- A list of unique integers sorted in ascending order.

Example
sorted_unique_elements([4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 4, 4]) -> [1, 4, 5, 6]
sorted_unique_elements([]) -> []
sorted_unique_elements([4, 4, 4, 4]) -> [4]

Note
- The input list may contain both positive and negative integers and the numbers can appear in any order.
- The solution should manage duplicate entries efficiently by ensuring the complexity remains low even with larger inputs.

'''You have been given the task to create a function that takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers). Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,... So you need to identify a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13). Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.

    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.

Description:
Given a list containing various types of Python values, your task is to create a function that filters and returns only the integers from this list. You should ensure that the order of integers is preserved from the original list. The list may contain a variety of Python objects such as strings, floats, booleans, lists, or any other data types, but you are only interested in extracting integers and returning them in a new list. Remember that integers in Python are whole numbers, and you should not include values that cannot be strictly identified as integers. Consider edge cases where the list might be empty or contain no integers at all. You may assume the input list is always defined and contains Python values. The function should be efficient and handle larger lists gracefully. Please also ensure that your solution is compatible with Python 3.x versions, including any backward or forward compatibility considerations.

The list may contain a variety of Python objects such as strings, floats, booleans, lists, or any other data types, but you are only interested in extracting integers and returning them in a new list. Remember that integers in Python are whole numbers, and you should not include values that cannot be strictly identified as integers. Consider edge cases where the list might be empty or contain no integers at all. You may assume the input list is always defined and contains Python values. The function should be efficient and handle larger lists gracefully. Please also ensure that your solution is compatible with Python 3.x versions, including any backward or forward compatibility considerations.

def move_one_ball(arr):	
'''We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N]. The numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You can perform the operation of right shifting any number of times.

One right shift operation means moving all elements of the array one position to the right. The last element of the array will be moved to the first position in the array i.e. 0th index.

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.
For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.

Description:
Given a list containing various types of Python values, your task is to create a function that filters and returns only the integers from this list. You should ensure that the order of integers is preserved from the original list. The list may contain a variety of Python objects such as strings, floats, booleans, lists, or any other data types, but you are only interested in extracting integers and returning them in a new list. Remember that integers in Python are whole numbers, and you should not include values that cannot be strictly identified as integers. Consider edge cases where the list might be empty or contain no integers at all. You may assume the input list is always defined and contains Python values. The function should be efficient and handle larger lists gracefully. Please also ensure that your solution is compatible with Python 3.x versions, including any backward or forward compatibility considerations.

the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the array. You need to consider only the first k elements for the sum calculation.
Example:

        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

    Constraints:
        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
