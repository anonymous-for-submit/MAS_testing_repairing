A happy string is defined as one with a minimum length of 3 and each set of three consecutive characters being different. The function should return a boolean value based on this definition. The requirements are clear and concise, focusing on the functionality of the string validation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function is_happy(s) to check if a string is happy.\n- Ensure the function handles strings of varying lengths efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy string input and result display.\n- Optimize the application for performance to handle large datasets.\n- Design an aesthetically pleasing UI to enhance user experience.\nWe will use Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities to check if each set of three consecutive characters in the string are different. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's simplicity and readability.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'successive characters': means consecutive characters in the string\n    'minimum of 3': means the string must have at least 3 characters\n    'different': means each set of three consecutive characters should be unique\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_happy(s)`, we need to:\n    1.
