We will check each element at an odd index to see if it is even, and if so, add it to a running total. This approach ensures efficiency and simplicity in handling the task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even numbers': numbers divisible by 2 without a remainder\n    'odd indices': indices that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5, etc.)\n\n    Explanation: The requirement is to sum up all even numbers that are located at odd indices in a list of integers.

Therefore, it should be included in the sum, resulting in the output -2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
