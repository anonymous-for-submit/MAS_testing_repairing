The function will calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after meals, ensuring that if there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, all available remaining carrots are eaten.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the act of eating carrots to fulfill a need or requirement.\n    Explanation: In this context, the core concept revolves around the act of eating carrots to satisfy a certain number of needs or to complete a day's meals.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than the number it has already consumed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': indicates a comparison where the number of carrots needed is more than the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: This degree adverb emphasizes the requirement to eat more carrots than the amount already consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first check if the remaining carrots are sufficient to meet the need. If not, it should consume all available remaining carrots.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 3) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 5 carrots and needs 6 more. There are only 3 remaining carrots. The function will eat all 3 remaining carrots, making the total eaten 8, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 2) = [5, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 3 carrots and needs 5 more. There are only 2 remaining carrots. The function will eat all 2 remaining carrots, making the total eaten 5, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(2, 3, 1) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 2 carrots and needs 3 more. There is 1 remaining carrot. The function will eat the 1 remaining carrot, making the total eaten 3, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if need <= number:\n            return [number + remaining, 0]\n        else:\n            return [number + remaining, 0 if remaining >= need - number else remaining - (need - number)]\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves creating a function that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount based on the initial number of carrots eaten, the number of carrots needed to complete meals, and the number of remaining carrots. The function should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, in which case all remaining carrots are eaten.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount.\n- The application should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.\n- The design should be visually appealing and simple.\nWe will create a simple Python function that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount based on the initial number of carrots eaten, the number of carrots needed to complete meals, and the number of remaining carrots. The function will handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, in which case all remaining carrots are eaten.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': The core concept here is the tracking of the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount after meals.\n    Explanation: The function `eat` tracks the total number of carrots eaten and calculates the remaining amount after meals, ensuring that if there are not enough carrots to meet the need, all remaining carrots are consumed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of carrots needed exceeds the number of carrots already eaten.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" is used to compare the number of carrots needed (`need`) with the number of carrots already eaten (`number`).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': Indicates that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number of carrots already eaten.\n    Explanation: The adverb \"more\" is used to describe the relationship between the number of carrots needed and the number of carrots already eaten, emphasizing that the need is greater than the amount already consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should:\n    1. Calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the initial number of carrots eaten (`number`) to the number of remaining carrots.\n    2. Determine the number of carrots left after meals by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining carrots.\n    3. If the total number of carrots eaten exceeds the remaining carrots, the function should eat all remaining carrots and return the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 3) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit eats all 3 remaining carrots, reaching a total of 8 carrots eaten, with 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 2) = [5, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit eats the 2 remaining carrots, reaching a total of 5 carrots eaten, with 0 carrots left.\n    eat(2, 3, 1) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit eats the 1 remaining carrot, reaching a total of 3 carrots eaten, with 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can handle cases where the rabbit eats all remaining carrots if needed.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function requires to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining stock after consumption. It should handle cases where the remaining stock is less than the need. The constraints ensure that the inputs are within a reasonable range.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main function should correctly calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining stock.\n- The application should handle cases where the remaining stock is less than the need for carrots.\n- The user interface should be simple and easy to use.\nTo implement the function, we will use Python due to its simplicity and readability. The function will calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining stock based on the inputs provided.

It should also handle cases where the remaining stock is less than the need for carrots.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(2, 11, 5) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The user has eaten 2 carrots, needs 11 more, and there are 5 remaining. The function will eat all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 7 eaten and 0 remaining.\n    eat(1, 10, 10) = [11, 0]\n    Explanation: The user has eaten 1 carrot, needs 10 more, and there are 10 remaining.
