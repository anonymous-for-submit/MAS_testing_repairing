The function will return an empty list for an empty input and increment each element by 1 for non-empty lists.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirement is to create a function that increments each element in a list by 1. The function should handle both small and large lists efficiently. Clarity and simplicity are key to ensure the function is easy to use and understand. The function should also be optimized for performance, especially for large lists.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should increment each element in the list by 1\n- The function should handle lists of any size efficiently\n- The function should be clearly documented for easy understanding\n- The function should be optimized for performance\n- The function should be tested thoroughly to ensure accuracy\nTo create a simple and efficient function that increments each element in a list by 1, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and the 'typing' module to ensure type hints are clear. The function will be optimized for performance, ensuring it handles large lists efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'increment': means adding 1 to each element in the list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Iterate through the list and increment each element by 1.\n\n# [edge case] \n    incr_list([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list should return an empty list since there are no elements to increment.\n    incr_list([0]) = [1]\n    Explanation: The only element in the list is 0, which should be incremented to 1.\n    incr_list([-1, -2, -3]) = [0, -1, -2]\n    Explanation: Each element in the list is negative, and incrementing them by 1 should result in their respective positive counterparts.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic already correctly handles an empty list by returning an empty list.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef incr_list(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    '''Return list.
