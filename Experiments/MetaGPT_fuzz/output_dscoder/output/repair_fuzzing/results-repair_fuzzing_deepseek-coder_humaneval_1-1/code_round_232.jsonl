The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the multiplication and check for whole numbers.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to implement a function that can multiply two fractions and determine if the result is a whole number. The function should handle fractions in the form of strings with numerators and denominators, ensuring no zero in the denominator. The function should be efficient and capable of handling a wide range of fraction values.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to multiply two fractions and check if the result is a whole number\n- Ensure the function can handle fractions in string format with no zero in the denominator\n- Optimize the function for efficiency and wide range of fraction values\n- Provide clear documentation and examples for the function usage\nTo implement the function that multiplies two fractions and checks if the result is a whole number, we will use Python's built-in capabilities for handling fractions. We will parse the input strings to extract numerators and denominators, perform the multiplication, and then check if the result is a whole number. This approach leverages Python's simplicity and efficiency for mathematical operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'fraction multiplication': means multiplying two fractions to get a result\n    'whole number': means the result of the multiplication is an integer\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Parse the input strings to extract numerators and denominators.\n    - Convert the fractions to a common type (e.g., fractions.Fraction).\n    - Multiply the fractions.\n    - Check if the product is a whole number.\n    - Return True if it is a whole number, otherwise return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    simplify('1/2', '3/4') = False\n    Explanation: The multiplication of 1/2 and 3/4 is 3/8, which is not a whole number.\n    simplify('2/3', '3/2') = True\n    Explanation: The multiplication of 2/3 and 3/2 is 1, which is a whole number.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
