However, to enhance the product, we need to consider user experience, accessibility, and UI design.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly generate the string sequence as per the requirement.\n- Implement user-friendly interface for easy difficulty selection and score display.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works well on mobile devices.\n- Design a beautiful UI that meets the aesthetic expectations of the users.\n- Include a restart button for a seamless gameplay experience.\nWe will implement the function `string_sequence` using Python, leveraging the simplicity and readability of the language. The function will generate a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive. This is a straightforward task that can be accomplished using a simple loop and string concatenation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'space-delimited numbers'\n    In the requirement, it means that the numbers in the output string are separated by spaces.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Define the function `string_sequence` with a parameter `n` of type `int`.\n    (2) Initialize an empty string `result` to store the sequence of numbers.\n    (3) Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to `n` inclusive.\n    (4) In each iteration, convert the current number to a string and concatenate it to `result` with a space.\n    (5) Return the `result` string with the final space removed.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    Explanation: When `n` is 0, the function should return the string '0' as there is only one number in the sequence.\n    string_sequence(1) = '0 1'\n    Explanation: When `n` is 1, the function should return the string '0 1' as it includes numbers from 0 to 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge case since the provided logic already handles the case when `n` is 0.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements are clear and concise, asking for a function that generates a string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive, separated by spaces. This is a basic functionality that can be expanded upon to include more features like user customization, better UI, and mobile compatibility.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should generate a string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive, separated by spaces.\n- Implement user-friendly UI with options for difficulty levels and score display.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works well on mobile devices.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to generate the required string of numbers. This approach is simple and leverages Python's efficiency for such tasks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence': means a list of numbers in order from 0 to n\n\n    'space-delimited': means each number is separated by a space in the final string\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To generate the string of numbers from 0 to n, we can use a simple loop or Python's list comprehension combined with the `join` method.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    explanation: When n is 0, the sequence is just '0'.\n    string_sequence(1) = '0 1'\n    explanation: When n is 1, the sequence includes numbers from 0 to 1, separated by spaces.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient for n = 0.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a simple implementation of the logic described:\n    ```python\n    def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n        return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))\n    ```\n    This function uses a generator expression to convert each number in the range from 0 to n into a string, and then `join` is used to concatenate these strings with spaces in between.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a string of numbers from 0 to n, space-delimited.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string of numbers from 0 to n, space-delimited.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 296, "repair_prompt": ["def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''\n\n    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    return ' '.join(numbers)", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    '''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 13}
