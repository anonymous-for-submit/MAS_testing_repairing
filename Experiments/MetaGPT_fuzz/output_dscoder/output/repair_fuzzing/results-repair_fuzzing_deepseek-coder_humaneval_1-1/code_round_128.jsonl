The input string provides the counts in a text format, and the function needs to extract these numbers and perform a simple arithmetic operation to find the number of mango fruits.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of apples and oranges combined is less than the total number of fruits.\n    Explanation: This phrase is used to express the relationship between the sum of apples and oranges and the total number of fruits. For example, if the total number of fruits is 10, and there are 3 apples and 4 oranges, the remaining fruits (mangoes) can be calculated as 10 - 3 - 4.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that among the possible counts of apples and oranges, the one that maximizes the number of mangoes should be chosen.\n    Explanation: This adverb is used to specify that the solution should consider the largest possible values for apples and oranges to maximize the number of mangoes.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first parse the input string to extract the number of apples and oranges. Then, it should calculate the number of mango fruits by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 10) = 5\n    Explanation: The total number of fruits is 10, and there are 2 apples and 3 oranges. The number of mango fruits is calculated as 10 - 2 - 3 = 5.\n    edge case 2:\n    fruit_distribution(\"4 apples and 5 oranges\", 15) = 6\n    Explanation: The total number of fruits is 15, and there are 4 apples and 5 oranges. The number of mango fruits is calculated as 15 - 4 - 5 = 6.\n    edge case 3:\n    fruit_distribution(\"1 apple and 1 orange\", 5) = 3\n    Explanation: The total number of fruits is 5, and there is 1 apple and 1 orange. The number of mango fruits is calculated as 5 - 1 - 1 = 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
