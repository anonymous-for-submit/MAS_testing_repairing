{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The node to be plucked should be the one with the lowest even value. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index. The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ]. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\nExample 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the

We will optimize the performance for large datasets by using list comprehensions and built-in functions that are optimized for such tasks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'non-negative integers': means that all the values in the list are positive or zero.\n    'lowest even value': means the smallest even number present in the list.\n    'smallest index': means the position of the first occurrence of the smallest even value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': means the lowest value among the even numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Iterate through the list to find all even numbers.\n    - Track the smallest even number and its index.\n    - Return the smallest even number along with its index.\n    - If no even numbers are found, return an empty list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([4, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it appears at index 1.\n    pluck([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it appears at index 1.\n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so there are no even numbers to pluck.\n    pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) = [0, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 0, and it appears at index 1. There are two zeros, but we choose the first one due to its smallest index.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all edge cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.798], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 79], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef pluck(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the smallest even value and its index from a list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[int]: A list containing the smallest even value and its index.\n                 If no even numbers are found, returns an empty list.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_even = float('inf')\n    min_index = -1\n\n    for index, value in enumerate(arr):\n        if value % 2 == 0 and value < min_even:\n            min_even = value\n            min_index = index\n        elif value % 2 == 0 and value == min_even:\n            min_even = value\n            min_index = index\n\n    if min_even == float('inf'):\n        return []\n    else:\n        return [min_even, min_index]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 272, "repair_prompt": ["def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
