Check if the list 'q' is a palindrome.\n    2. Calculate the sum of the elements in 'q'.\n    3. Compare the sum with the maximum possible weight 'w'.\n    4. Return 'True' if both conditions are met, otherwise return 'False'.\n\n# [edge case] \n    will_it_fly([], 5) = False\n    Explanation: An empty list cannot fly, regardless of the weight limit.\n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 0) = False\n    Explanation: The sum of the elements is 6, which exceeds the weight limit of 0.\n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 6) = True\n    Explanation: The list is balanced (palindrome) and the sum of its elements (6) does not exceed the weight limit (6).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can naturally handle cases where the list is empty or when the sum of elements is exactly equal to the weight limit.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_palindrome(lst: list) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to check if a list is a palindrome.\n    \"\"\"\n    return lst == lst[::-1]\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: list, w: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to check if a list is a palindrome and if the sum of its elements does not exceed 'w'.\n    \n    Args:\n        q (list): A list of integers.\n        w (int): An integer representing the maximum possible weight.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the list is a palindrome and the sum of its elements does not exceed 'w', otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not q:\n        return False\n    \n    if is_palindrome(q):\n        return sum(q) <= w\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 10))  # True\n# print(will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 0))         # False\n# print(will_it_fly([], 5))                # False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 725, "repair_prompt": ["def will_it_fly(q,w):\t\n'''Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
