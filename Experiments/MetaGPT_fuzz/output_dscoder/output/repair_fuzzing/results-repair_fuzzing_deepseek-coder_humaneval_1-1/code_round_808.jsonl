For example, the binary representation of the decimal number 5 is 101, which means 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integers whose binary representation has more than a certain number of ones.\n    Explanation: For example, if we say \"more than two ones,\" we are looking for numbers whose binary representation has three or more ones.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending order': means that we are arranging numbers from smallest to largest.\n    Explanation: In the context of sorting, ascending order means that the smallest number comes first, and the largest number comes last.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the sorting function, we will use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a custom key. This key will count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they will be sorted by their decimal value.\n\n    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n    1. Define the function `sort_array(arr)`.\n    2. Use the `sorted()` function with a custom key that counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.\n    3. If two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them by their decimal value.\n    4. Return the sorted array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sort_array([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: The number 0 in binary is also 0, which has 0 ones. The function should return the array with the single element 0.\n    sort_array([7, 3, 5]) = [3, 5, 7]\n    Explanation: The binary representations of 7, 3, and 5 are 111, 11, and 101, respectively. Sorting by the number of ones and then by decimal value gives us [3, 5, 7].\n    sort_array([10, 100, 1000]) = [10, 100, 1000]\n    Explanation: The binary representations of 10, 100, and 1000 are 1010, 1100100, and 1111101000, respectively. All numbers have the same number of ones, so they are sorted by their decimal value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
