The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The steps are as follows:\n    1. If b is 0, then the GCD is a.\n    2. Otherwise, replace a with b and b with a modulo b.\n    3. Repeat the process until b becomes 0.\n    4. The GCD is the value of a when b is 0.\n\n# [edge case] \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD of 0 and any positive number is the number itself.\n    greatest_common_divisor(12, 0) = 12\n    Explanation: The GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.\n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: The GCD of 0 and 0 is undefined in the context of this function, but for the sake of this implementation, we can define it as 0, as it is the most reasonable output in this context.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where both numbers are 0.\n        if a == 0 and b == 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b using the Euclidean Algorithm.'''\n    # Handle the edge case where both numbers are 0\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Apply the Euclidean Algorithm\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    \n    return a\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 766, "repair_prompt": ["def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\t\n'''Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
