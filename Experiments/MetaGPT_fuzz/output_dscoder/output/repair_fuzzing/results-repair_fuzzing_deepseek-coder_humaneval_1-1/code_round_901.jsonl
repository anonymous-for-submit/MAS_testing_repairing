This requires a simple yet effective method to validate the string against these conditions.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check if the string meets the happy criteria.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy understanding and usage.\n- Test the function with various test cases to ensure accuracy and reliability.\nTo implement the function `is_happy(s)` that checks if a string is happy, we need to ensure it meets the criteria that its length is at least 3 and each group of three consecutive characters are different. We will use Python's built-in string operations and a simple loop to check each group of three characters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'happy string': a string with a length of at least 3 where each group of three consecutive characters are different.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that a string is considered \"happy\" if it meets two conditions: it must be at least 3 characters long, and each group of three consecutive characters must be unique.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least 3': means the string must have a minimum length of 3 characters.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the string's length must be greater than or equal to 3 for it to be considered happy.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'different': means that each group of three consecutive characters in the string must be unique.\n    Explanation: This adverb emphasizes the requirement that no group of three consecutive characters in the string should be the same.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function `is_happy(s)`, we need to:\n    1.
