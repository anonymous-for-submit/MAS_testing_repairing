This can be implemented in Python as follows:\n\n    from sympy import isprime\n\n    def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n        words = sentence.split()\n        prime_length_words = [word for word in words if isprime(len(word))]\n        return ' '.join(prime_length_words)\n```\n\n# [edge case]\n```python\n    words_in_sentence(\"hello world\") = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: In this case, \"hello\" and \"world\" have lengths 5 and 5, respectively. Both are prime numbers, but since the order should be the same as the original sentence, \"hello\" is returned.\n\n    words_in_sentence(\"a b c d e\") = \"a b\"\n    Explanation: Here, \"a\" and \"b\" are the only words with prime lengths (1 and 2, respectively). Since the order is maintained, \"a b\" is returned.\n\n    words_in_sentence(\"non-prime-length\") = \"\"\n    Explanation: There are no words with prime lengths in this sentence, so an empty string is returned.\n```\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n```python\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan already covers cases with no prime-length words or sentences with only one word.\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the requirement, the plan, and potential edge cases, ensuring the code is robust and handles various scenarios effectively.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to filter out words from a sentence based on their length being a prime number. This involves checking each word's length and determining if it's prime.
