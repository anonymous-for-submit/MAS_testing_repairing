For negative numbers, the sum will account for the first signed digit being negative. The function will return the count of numbers meeting this criterion. We will also handle edge cases such as empty arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of digits': the total of all individual digits in a number\n    'signed digit': a digit that is part of a negative number, carrying a negative sign\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through each number in the array, calculate the sum of its digits, and check if this sum is greater than 0. For negative numbers, account for the first signed digit being negative.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_nums([]) == 0\n    Explanation: An empty array has no numbers, so the count is 0.\n    count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1\n    Explanation: Only the number 11 has a sum of digits (1+1) which is greater than 0.\n    count_nums([1, -2, 3]) == 2\n    Explanation: The numbers 1 and 3 have sums of digits 1 and 3 respectively, both of which are greater than 0. The number -2 has a sum of digits (-2) which is not greater than 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic for summing digits and checking if the sum is greater than 0 naturally handles negative numbers by considering the first signed digit.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to write a function that counts the number of elements in an array of integers where the sum of the digits is greater than 0. The function should handle both positive and negative numbers correctly. The sum of digits includes considering the sign of the number, e.g., for -123, the digits are -1, 2, and 3.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the sum of digits for each number, including negative numbers.\n- The function should return 0 for an empty array.\n- The solution should be efficient and handle large datasets without performance issues.\n- The code should be well-documented and easy to understand for other developers.\nTo implement the function `count_nums` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the power of list comprehensions for clarity and simplicity. The function will iterate through each number in the input array, calculate the sum of its digits, and then count how many of these sums are greater than zero. This approach ensures that the function is both easy to understand and maintain.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of digits': means the total of all individual digits in a number\n    'signed digits': means considering the sign of each digit in a negative number\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to implement the function `count_nums`:\n    1. Iterate through each number in the input array.\n    2. Convert each number to a string to easily access each digit.\n    3. Calculate the sum of the digits, considering the sign for negative numbers.\n    4. Check if the sum of the digits is greater than zero.\n    5. Count the numbers that meet the condition.\n    6. Return the count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_nums([]) = 0\n    Explanation: The input array is empty, so there are no elements to count. The expected output is 0.\n    count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) = 1\n    Explanation: The sum of digits for -1 is -1, for 11 is 2, and for -11 is -2. Only 11 has a sum of digits greater than zero.\n    count_nums([1, 1, 2]) = 3\n    Explanation: The sum of digits for 1, 1, and 2 are 1, 1, and 2 respectively.
