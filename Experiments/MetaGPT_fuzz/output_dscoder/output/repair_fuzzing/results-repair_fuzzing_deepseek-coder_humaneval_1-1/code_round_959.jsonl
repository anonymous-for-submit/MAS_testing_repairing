For example, the binary number '1101' represents \\(1 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0\\), which equals 13 in decimal.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `decimal_to_binary(decimal)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the decimal number to a binary string using Python's built-in `bin()` function.\n    2. Remove the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary numbers.\n    3. Add 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string to meet the formatting requirements.\n    4. Return the formatted binary string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    decimal_to_binary(0) = \"db0db\"\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 0 is '0', and when formatted with 'db' at the beginning and end, it becomes \"db0db\".\n    decimal_to_binary(1) = \"db1db\"\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is '1', and when formatted with 'db' at the beginning and end, it becomes \"db1db\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
