{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes, your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

The function will iterate through the array to find the smallest even value and its index. If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, it will return the one with the smallest index. The function will handle edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays without even numbers by returning an empty list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'smallest even value'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the smallest value among the even numbers in the list.

The expected output is [2, 0].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic can handle the cases where there are no even numbers or the list is empty by returning an empty list.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the smallest even value in an array and return it along with its index. The function should handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values. The solution should be efficient and handle large datasets.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to find the smallest even value in an array.\n- Ensure the function returns the index of the smallest even value.\n- Handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values.\n- Optimize the function for large datasets to ensure performance.\n- Ensure the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\nWe will implement the function `pluck` using Python, leveraging the built-in capabilities of the language to handle the array and find the smallest even value efficiently. The function will iterate through the array, check for even values, and keep track of the smallest even value and its index. If no even values are found, it will return an empty list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'smallest even value'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the smallest value among the even numbers in the list. If multiple even numbers have the same smallest value, the one with the smallest index is chosen.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred that we need to find values that are greater than zero to consider them for the smallest even value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the smallest value among the even numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the array to find the smallest even value and its index. Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index.\n    2. Iterate through the array.\n    3. For each element, check if it is even and greater than zero.\n    4. If it is the smallest even value found so far, update the smallest even value and its index.\n    5. After iterating through the array, return the result as a list containing the smallest even value and its index. If no even values are found, return an empty list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([4, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so there are no values to consider.\n    pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) = [0, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 0, and there are two zeros, so we choose the first zero with the smallest index of 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
