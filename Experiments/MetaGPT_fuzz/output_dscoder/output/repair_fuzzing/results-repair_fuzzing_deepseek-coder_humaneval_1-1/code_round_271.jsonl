The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases efficiently.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that sums all odd elements found at even positions in a list of integers. The function should be efficient, meaning it should handle lists of different sizes without significant performance degradation. The solution should also be easy to understand and use, with clear examples provided.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently sum odd elements at even positions.\n- Ensure the function handles lists of various sizes without performance issues.\n- Provide clear and concise documentation with examples.\n- Include test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.\n- Optimize the code for both time and space complexity.\nTo create an efficient solution that sums all odd elements found at even positions in a list of integers, we will use Python's built-in functions and iterators. This approach ensures that the function is both time and space efficient.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd elements', 'even positions'\n    Explanation: 'odd elements' refers to integers that are not divisible by 2, and 'even positions' refers to the indices of the list that are even (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the list, check if the index is even and the element is odd, then sum these elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are even and at even positions, so the sum is 0.\n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7]) = 16\n    Explanation: All elements at even positions (0, 2) are odd, so the sum is 1+5+7 = 13.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic will correctly return 0 for a list of even numbers.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'efficient'\n    Explanation: The requirement emphasizes the importance of time and space complexity in the solution.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Iterate through the list, check if the index is even and the element is odd, then sum these elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 4\n    Explanation: The odd elements at even positions are 1 (at position 0) and 3 (at position 2), so the sum is 1+3 = 4.\n    solution([10, 10, 10, 10]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are even, so the sum is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
