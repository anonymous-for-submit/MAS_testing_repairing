The function should handle lists of integers and return a list of sorted unique shared items. The use of 'set' in the function signature is a hint that the solution should involve using sets for efficient operations. The function should be efficient and handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with no common items.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to return sorted unique shared items from two lists.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and can handle large lists.\n- Include error handling for empty lists or lists with no common items.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large datasets.\n- Include tests to verify the function's correctness and robustness.\nTo implement the function efficiently and handle large lists, we will use Python's built-in set operations, which are optimized for performance. We will convert the input lists to sets to find the intersection, and then convert the result back to a list for sorting and returning.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'unique shared items': means that the items that appear in both lists and should not have duplicates.\n    'sorted': means that the final list should be in ascending order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Convert both lists to sets to find the intersection.\n    - Convert the intersection result back to a list.\n    - Sort the list of shared items.\n    - Return the sorted list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    common([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) = []\n    explanation: There are no common items between the two lists, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    common([], [1, 2, 3]) = []\n    explanation: An empty list has no items to compare, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    common([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4, 5]) = [2]\n    explanation: The number 2 is the only item that appears in both lists, so the expected output is a list containing 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
