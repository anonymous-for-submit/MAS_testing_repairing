The function should return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and vice versa. The requirements include handling edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no brackets. The function should also handle cases where the brackets are not properly paired.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check bracket pairing\n- Handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings with no brackets\n- Ensure the function is efficient and handles large inputs\n- Provide clear error messages for improperly bracketed strings\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the bracket checking function. The function will iterate through the input string and use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If these conditions are met, the top of the stack is popped. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket, the function will return False. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets are correctly paired, and the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'stack'\n    In the requirement, a stack is used to keep track of opening brackets and ensure they are properly closed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan provided outlines a clear approach to implement the function using a stack. The steps include:\n    1. Iterate through the input string.\n    2. Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n    3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n    4. For each closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket.\n    5. If conditions are met, pop the top of the stack.\n    6.
