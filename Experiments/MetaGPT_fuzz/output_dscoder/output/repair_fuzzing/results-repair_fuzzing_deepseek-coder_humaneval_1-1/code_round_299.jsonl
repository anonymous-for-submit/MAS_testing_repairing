This is a straightforward task that involves using a set to store unique characters and then returning the size of the set.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately count the number of unique characters in a string.\n- The application should be case-insensitive, counting 'A' and 'a' as the same character.\n- The solution should be efficient and concise, using Python's built-in data structures.\nWe will use Python's built-in data structures to achieve the goal efficiently. Specifically, we will convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity, then use a set to store unique characters, and finally return the size of the set.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'unique characters': means each character that appears in the string should be counted only once, regardless of its case.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters from the string.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of unique characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('Hello, World!') = 10\n    Explanation: The string contains 10 unique characters after converting to lowercase: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for edge cases as the logic provided covers all characters in the string.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the Python code to implement the function:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n        # Convert the string to lowercase\n        string = string.lower()\n        # Use a set to store unique characters\n        unique_chars = set(string)\n        # Return the number of unique characters\n        return len(unique_chars)\n    ```\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    '''Given a string, this function returns the number of unique characters present in it, ignoring case sensitivity.'''\n    # Convert the string to lowercase\n    string = string.lower()\n    # Use a set to store unique characters\n    unique_chars = set(string)\n    # Return the number of unique characters\n    return len(unique_chars)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 299, "repair_prompt": ["def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\t\n'''Given a string, your task is to determine the number of unique characters present in it.
