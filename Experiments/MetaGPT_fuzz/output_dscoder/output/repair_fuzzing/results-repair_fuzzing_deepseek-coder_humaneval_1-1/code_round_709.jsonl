It will also handle edge cases such as when the rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet or when no carrots are left.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the process of a rabbit eating carrots to meet its daily requirement.\n    Explanation: The function `eat` deals with the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after the rabbit's meals.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already eaten.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals\" indicates that the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': means the rabbit needs to eat a greater number of carrots than it has already eaten.\n    Explanation: The adverb \"more\" in the requirement suggests that the rabbit needs to eat a quantity of carrots that is greater than the quantity it has already consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should consider the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after the rabbit eats as much as needed or possible. It should handle edge cases such as when the rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet or when no carrots are left.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(0, 5, 3) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet, so it will eat all 3 remaining carrots. After eating, there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 0) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 3 carrots, but there are no remaining carrots. The rabbit will eat all the remaining 0 carrots, and after eating, there will be 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers these cases by checking if the number of remaining carrots is 0 or if the rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves creating a function that simulates the eating behavior of a hungry rabbit, taking into account the number of carrots already eaten, the number needed to complete the day's meals, and the remaining carrots.

The function will take into account the number of carrots already eaten, the number needed to complete the day's meals, and the remaining carrots.

Ensure the rabbit eats all available carrots if there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(0, 5, 3) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet, so it will eat all 3 remaining carrots. After eating, there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 3) = [6, 1]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has already eaten 3 carrots, so it will eat 3 more during the current meal, totaling 6 carrots eaten. There will be 1 carrot left.\n    eat(5, 5, 3) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit needs to eat 5 more carrots to complete the day's meals, but there are only 3 remaining.

It should return the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating. The function must handle edge cases such as when no carrots have been eaten, when the need exceeds the remaining carrots, and when all remaining carrots are eaten.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.\n- The function should handle cases where the rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet.\n- The function should handle cases where the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than are available.\n- The function should handle cases where all remaining carrots are eaten.\n- The function should be efficient and handle edge cases gracefully.\nTo implement the 'eat' function, we will follow a straightforward approach that ensures the rabbit's eating behavior is accurately modeled. We will consider the number of carrots already eaten, the number needed, and the remaining carrots to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left. The function will handle edge cases by ensuring that if the rabbit needs more carrots than are available, it will eat all remaining carrots and still be hungry.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': means tracking the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already eaten.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number already eaten to the number of carrots eaten during the current meal.\n    - Calculate the number of carrots left by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining carrots.\n    - If the number of carrots needed is more than the remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all remaining carrots.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(0, 5, 3) = [3, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit hasn't eaten any carrots yet, so it will eat all 3 remaining carrots.\n    eat(5, 10, 0) = [5, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit needs more carrots than are available, so it eats all 0 remaining carrots, and still needs 5 more.\n    eat(3, 2, 3) = [5, 1]\n    Explanation: The rabbit eats 2 more carrots, making a total of 5 eaten, with 1 carrot left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
