The logic provided in the plan already covers the edge case of 0 correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. The solution should handle both positive and negative integers correctly. The output should be returned as a tuple. This requirement is clear and straightforward, aligning well with the product goals of engaging the user and improving accessibility.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function that accurately counts even and odd digits in a given integer.\n- Ensure the function works for both positive and negative integers.\n- Return the result as a tuple (even_count, odd_count).\n- Design an intuitive user interface for easy understanding of the result.\n- Optimize the performance for large numbers to ensure smooth user experience.\nTo implement the function `even_odd_count` that counts the number of even and odd digits in a given integer, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and handle both positive and negative integers. The function will convert the integer to a string to iterate through each digit, checking if it's even or odd, and then count them accordingly. The result will be returned as a tuple.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even' and 'odd': These are key concepts referring to the parity of digits. Even numbers are divisible by 2, while odd numbers are not.\n    Explanation: The function needs to distinguish between even and odd digits in a given integer, regardless of its sign.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit.\n    (2) Handle the sign of the integer to ensure both positive and negative numbers are processed correctly.\n    (3) Initialize counters for even and odd digits.\n    (4) Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the integer.\n    (5) Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter.\n    (6) Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 has one even digit (0) and no odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(13579) = (0, 5)\n    Explanation: The number 13579 has no even digits and five odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(-24680) = (4, 1)\n    Explanation: The number -24680 has four even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) and one odd digit (0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
