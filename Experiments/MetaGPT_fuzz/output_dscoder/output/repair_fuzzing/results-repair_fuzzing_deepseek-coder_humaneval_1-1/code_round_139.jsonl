This approach ensures efficiency and clarity in the code.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd elements', 'even positions'\n    In the requirement, 'odd elements' refers to integers that are not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1 when divided by 2), and 'even positions' refer to the indices of the list that are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the list, check if the index is even and the value is odd, then sum these values.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([5]) = 5\n    Explanation: The list contains only one element which is at an even position (index 0) and is odd.\n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: All elements are at even positions, but they are all even numbers, so the sum of odd elements at even positions is 0.\n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]) = 16\n    Explanation: The odd elements at even positions are 1 (at index 0), 5 (at index 2), and 7 (at index 4). Their sum is 1 + 5 + 7 = 13.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic to sum odd elements at even positions is straightforward and does not require additional handling for these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solution(lst: list[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of odd elements located at even positions.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list[int]): A list of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of odd elements located at even positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n        if index % 2 == 0 and value % 2 == 1:\n            total_sum += value\n            \n    return total_sum\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 139, "repair_prompt": ["def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0\n    '''", " def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n    '''\n\n    sum_of_odds = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 2", " def solution(lst):\n    '''Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\n    Examples\n        solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n        solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n        solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 185}
