We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping': means that we can count the overlapping appearances of a substring within the original string.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is that the function should account for overlapping occurrences of the substring within the original string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: '' appears four times in the original string. 'abc'.count('') returns 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements call for a function that inserts a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list.
