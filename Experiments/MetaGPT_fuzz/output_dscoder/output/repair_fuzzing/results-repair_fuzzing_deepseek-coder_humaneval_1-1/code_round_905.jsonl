{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

The solution should be efficient and scalable.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to find the smallest even value in an array\n- Ensure the function returns the index of the smallest even value\n- Handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values\n- Optimize the function for performance and scalability\n- Ensure the function is easy to understand and maintain\nTo implement the function `pluck` efficiently and handle various edge cases, we will use Python's built-in data structures and functions. The function will iterate through the array to find the smallest even value and its index. If no even values are found or the array is empty, it will return an empty list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'smallest even value': means the smallest value among the even numbers in the list.\n    'smallest index': means the position of the smallest even value in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': means the smallest value among the even numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the array to find the smallest even value and its index.\n    If no even values are found or the array is empty, return an empty list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([4, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so the output is an empty list.\n    pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) = [0, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 0, and there are two zeros, so we choose the first zero with the smallest index of 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
