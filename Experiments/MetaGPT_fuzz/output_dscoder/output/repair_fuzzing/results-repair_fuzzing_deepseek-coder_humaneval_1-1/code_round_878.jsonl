Define a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as an argument.\n    2. Create an empty string `result` to store the encrypted message.\n    3. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`.\n    4. Check if the character is an uppercase or lowercase letter.\n    5. Calculate the new position of the character by adding 4 to its ASCII value.\n    6. Handle wrapping around the alphabet using modulo arithmetic.\n    7. Append the encrypted character to the `result` string.\n    8. Return the `result` string after processing all characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    encrypt('z') = 'b'\n    Explanation: Since 'z' is the last letter of the alphabet, shifting it down by four positions should wrap around to 'b'.\n    encrypt('A') = 'E'\n    Explanation: The function should correctly handle uppercase letters, shifting 'A' down by four positions to 'E'.\n    encrypt('x') = 'z'\n    Explanation: Shifting 'x' down by four positions should wrap around to 'z', as 'x' is the 24th letter and shifting it down by 4 results in the 28th letter, which wraps around to the 26th letter (z).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The modulo arithmetic in step 5 ensures that the function correctly wraps around the alphabet for all letters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the Python code to implement the encryption function:\n\n    ```python\n    def encrypt(s):\n        result = \"\"\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isupper():\n                result += chr((ord(char) - 65 + 4) % 26 + 65)\n            else:\n                result += chr((ord(char) - 97 + 4) % 26 + 97)\n        return result\n    ```\n\n    This code handles both uppercase and lowercase letters by checking the case of each character with `isupper()` and then applying the appropriate shift. The modulo operation ensures that the new position wraps around the alphabet correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify the need for a function that encrypts a given string by rotating the alphabet such that each letter shifts down by two multiplied by two places.
