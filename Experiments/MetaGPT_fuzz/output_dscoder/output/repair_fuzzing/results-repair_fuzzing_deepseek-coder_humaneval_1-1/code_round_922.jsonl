The function should be tested with both 0 and 5 as inputs to ensure it works correctly.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly generate a string of numbers from 0 to n.\n- The function should handle both small and large values of n.\n- Implement a simple UI for the function to allow users to input the value of n.\n- Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.\n- Include a restart button in the UI for easy restarting of the sequence generation.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a simple function that generates a string of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces. This function will be straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence': means a list of numbers in order from 0 to n\n\n    'space-delimited': means each number is separated by a space in the final string\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using Python's built-in capabilities to generate the string. We can use a simple loop to iterate from 0 to n, convert each number to a string, and join them with spaces.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    explanation: When n is 0, the sequence consists of only the number 0, so the output is '0'.\n    string_sequence(1) = '0 1'\n    explanation: When n is 1, the sequence includes numbers 0 and 1, so the output is '0 1'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient for n = 0.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the function:\n\n    ```python\n    def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n        return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))\n    ```\n\n    This function uses a generator expression to convert each number in the range from 0 to n to a string, and then `join` is used to concatenate these strings with spaces in between.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a string of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 922, "repair_prompt": ["def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string that contains space-delimited numbers.
