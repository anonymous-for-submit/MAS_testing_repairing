The solution should be efficient and work quickly for large numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately count even and odd digits in a given integer.\n- The function should handle both positive and negative integers.\n- The solution should be efficient and work quickly for large numbers.\n- The user interface should be simple and easy to understand.\nTo implement the function `even_odd_count` that counts the number of even and odd digits in a given integer, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and the `collections` module for efficiency. The function will convert the integer to a string to iterate through each digit, checking if it's even or odd, and then count them.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even' and 'odd': These are key concepts referring to the parity of digits. Even numbers are divisible by 2, while odd numbers are not.\n    Explanation: The function needs to distinguish between even and odd digits in a given integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit.\n    (2) Initialize two counters, one for even digits and one for odd digits.\n    (3) Iterate through each character in the string representation of the integer.\n    (4) Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter.\n    (5) Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 is considered even, and since there are no other digits, the count of odd digits is 0.\n    even_odd_count(13579) = (0, 5)\n    Explanation: All digits in the number 13579 are odd, so the count of even digits is 0, and the count of odd digits is 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided will correctly handle the input 0 by counting it as even with an odd count of 0.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the function:\n\n    ```python\n    def even_odd_count(num):\n        num_str = str(abs(num))  # Convert to string and handle negative numbers\n        even_count = 0\n        odd_count = 0\n        \n        for digit in num_str:\n            if int(digit) % 2 == 0:\n                even_count += 1\n            else:\n                odd_count += 1\n        \n        return (even_count, odd_count)\n    ```\n"], "scores": [0.5316, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [42, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef even_odd_count(num: int) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The integer to count even and odd digits in.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the count of even digits and the count of odd digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_str = str(abs(num))  # Convert to string and handle negative numbers\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n\n    for digit in num_str:\n        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n\n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 114, "repair_prompt": ["def even_odd_count(num):\t\n'''Given an integer. return a tuple containing the count of digits that are even and those that are odd respectively.\nExample:\n        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''", " def even_odd_count(num):\t\n'''Given an integer, return a tuple containing the count of digits that are even and those that are odd respectively.\nExample:\n        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    num_str = str(abs(num))\n    for digit in num_str:\n        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:", " def even_odd_count(num):\n    '''Given an integer. return a tuple containing the count of digits that are even and those that are odd respectively.\n    Example:\n            even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)\n            even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 114}
