requirement is to create a function that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. The function should handle edge cases such as empty lists, returning (0, 1) as the result. The product of an empty list should be 1, as per mathematical convention. The function should be efficient and easy to use, suitable for both novice and experienced users.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the sum and product of a list of integers.\n- The function should handle empty lists and return (0, 1) as the result.\n- The application should be user-friendly and provide clear instructions or examples for user guidance.\n- The UI should be responsive and visually appealing, suitable for a range of devices.\nWe will implement the function `sum_product` using Python, leveraging basic Python functionalities to handle the sum and product calculations. The function will be designed to handle edge cases such as empty lists by returning (0, 1) as specified.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum' and 'product'\n    In the requirement, it means adding all the numbers together and multiplying all the numbers together respectively.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the list to calculate both the sum and the product. These operations can be done simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_product([]) = (0, 1)\n    Explanation: Since the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1 as specified.\n    sum_product([1]) = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: With a single element, the sum is the element itself, and the product is also the element since any number times 1 is itself.\n    sum_product([0, 1, 2]) = (3, 0)\n    Explanation: The sum is the sum of all elements, and the product is 0 because any number times 0 is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
