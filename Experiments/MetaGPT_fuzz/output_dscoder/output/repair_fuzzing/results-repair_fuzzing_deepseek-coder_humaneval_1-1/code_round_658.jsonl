This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for handling large datasets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive numbers': means that we need to filter out all the negative numbers and only keep the positive ones.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests iterating through the list and checking each number for positivity. If a number is positive, it will be added to a new list. This approach is efficient for handling large datasets.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_positive([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) = []\n    Explanation: Since all numbers in the list are negative, the function should return an empty list.\n    get_positive([0, 0, 0]) = []\n    Explanation: Since all numbers in the list are zero, the function should return an empty list.\n    get_positive([-1, 0, 1, 2, -2, 3, -3]) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The function should return only the positive numbers [1, 2, 3] ignoring the zero and negative numbers.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the original logic already correctly handles lists with only negative numbers or only zeros. The function will naturally return an empty list in these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_positive(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters out all negative numbers and returns a list of positive numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        l (List[int]): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: A list of positive integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    result: List[int] = []\n    for num in l:\n        if num > 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 658, "repair_prompt": ["def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Return only positive numbers in the list.
