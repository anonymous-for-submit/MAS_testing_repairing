The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. This method is both simple and fast, making it suitable for handling both small and large integers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'greatest common divisor (GCD)': The largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.\n    Explanation: The GCD is a fundamental concept in number theory, representing the largest number that can divide both given numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known method for finding the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The steps are as follows:\n    1. If b is 0, then the GCD is a.\n    2. Otherwise, replace a with b and b with a modulo b.\n    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until b becomes 0.\n    4. The GCD is the value of a when b becomes 0.\n\n# [edge case] \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD of 0 and any positive integer is the positive integer itself. This is because any number is divisible by itself and 0.\n    greatest_common_divisor(12, 0) = 12\n    Explanation: The GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. This is because any number is divisible by itself and 0.\n    greatest_common_divisor(17, 13) = 1\n    Explanation: The GCD of two coprime numbers (numbers that have no common divisors other than 1) is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The Euclidean algorithm inherently handles the case where one of the numbers is 0 by returning the other number as the GCD.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.\n    The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n        1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n        5\n    '''\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 928, "repair_prompt": ["def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\t\n'''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n    1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n    5\n    '''", " def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.\n    The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n        1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n        5\n    '''", " def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n'''Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n1\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n5\n'''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 126}
