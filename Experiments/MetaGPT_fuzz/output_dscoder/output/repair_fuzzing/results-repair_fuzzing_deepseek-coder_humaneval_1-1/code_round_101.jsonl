This approach is efficient and straightforward.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of 4 positive even numbers'\n    This means that the number can be represented as the sum of four even numbers, each greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we need to check if `n` is at least 8. If `n` is at least 8, then it can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2). If `n` is less than 8, it cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) = False\n    Explanation: 4 is less than 8, and it is not possible to express 4 as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) = False\n    Explanation: 6 is less than 8, and it is not possible to express 6 as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) = True\n    Explanation: 8 is at least 8, and it can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases since the logic is straightforward and does not require additional checks for these specific values.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if a given number n can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. This involves checking if n is divisible by 2 four times and if the result is positive. The function should be efficient and handle edge cases such as very small numbers or negative numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should accurately determine if the number can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as very small numbers and negative numbers correctly.\n- The function should be easy to understand and maintain.\n- The function should be compatible with Python's standard library and other Python functions.\nTo implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` efficiently, we will leverage Python's built-in capabilities and optimize for readability and maintainability. The function will check if a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. This involves checking if `n` is divisible by 2 at least four times and if the result is positive. We will ensure the function handles edge cases such as very small numbers and negative numbers correctly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of 4 positive even numbers'\n    This means that the number n should be the result of adding four even numbers together, all of which are greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we need to check if `n` is at least 8 (since the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2=8) and if it is divisible by 2 at least four times.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(1) = False\n    Explanation: The number 1 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers because the smallest even number is 2.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(3) = False\n    Explanation: The number 3 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers because the smallest sum of 4 even numbers is 8.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(0) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers because the smallest positive even number is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
