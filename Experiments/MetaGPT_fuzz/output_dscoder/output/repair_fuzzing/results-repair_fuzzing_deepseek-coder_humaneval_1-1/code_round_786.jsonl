Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->

The requirements are clear and concise, providing a straightforward task for the function.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include the compare function to accurately compare scores and guesses.\n- The game algorithm should be robust enough to handle various difficulty levels and provide a fair comparison.\n- Implement user authentication to save and track scores.\n- Develop a responsive UI that is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.\n- Include a restart button for users to easily reset the game after a loss.\nWe will implement the compare function using Python, leveraging the simplicity and power of the language to accurately compare scores and guesses. The function will iterate through both arrays, calculate the absolute difference between each score and guess, and return the results in a new array.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'comparison': means to compare the actual result with the guessed result.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to determine how close each guessed result is to the actual result in terms of score differences.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through both arrays and calculating the absolute difference between each score and guess.\n\n# [edge case] \n    compare([10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 30]) = [0, 0, 0]\n    Explanation: All guesses are correct, so the difference is 0 for each match.\n    compare([50, 60, 70], [45, 63, 68]) = [5, 3, 2]\n    Explanation: The differences between the guesses and the actual scores are 5, 3, and 2 respectively.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles the scenario where the lengths of the game and guess arrays are equal.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': means that all integers in the list are greater than 0.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the list contains only positive integers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find an integer greater than 0.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find the integer whose count is greater than or equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the largest integer that appears more than or equal to its value.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks for the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears twice, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping': means that we can count the overlapping appearances of the substring in the original string.\n    Explanation: The requirement allows for the counting of overlapping substrings, meaning that a substring can be counted multiple times if it overlaps with itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: '' appears four times in the original string. 'abc'.count('') returns 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that compares two arrays of scores and guesses, returning an array indicating how far off each guess was. The goal is to provide a clear, understandable comparison between the actual scores and the guessed scores. This function will be essential for a game where users need to guess the outcomes of matches and compare their guesses to the actual results.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately compare the scores and guesses.\n- The function should handle edge cases, such as when the guess is exactly correct.\n- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.\n- The game should be optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms.\nTo implement the function `compare` that compares two arrays of scores and guesses, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to ensure simplicity and efficiency. The function will iterate through both arrays, calculate the absolute difference between each corresponding score and guess, and return the results in a new array.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'comparison': means comparing the actual result with the guessed result.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves comparing the scores of matches with the guesses made by a person. The goal is to determine how far off each guess was, with a correct guess resulting in a value of 0 and an incorrect guess resulting in the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': means the frequency of the integer in the list.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"appears at least as many times as the integer itself\" indicates that we need to find an integer in the list that appears at least as many times as its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the biggest integer in the list.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb \"largest\" indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to implement the function:\n    1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.\n    2. Iterate through the list and update the frequency in the dictionary.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    4. Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) = [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    Explanation: In this edge case, all guesses are correct, so the output array contains all 0s.\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) = [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    Explanation: The guesses are not all correct.
