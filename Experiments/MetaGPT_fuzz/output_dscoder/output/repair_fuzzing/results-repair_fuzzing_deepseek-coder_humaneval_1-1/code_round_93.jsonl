This is a straightforward task that involves iterating through the list, checking for odd numbers at even indices, and summing them up.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to sum odd numbers at even indices\n- Ensure the function works efficiently for large lists\n- Include error handling for non-integer inputs\n- Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction\n- Optimize the UI for both desktop and mobile platforms\nWe will implement the function to sum odd numbers located at even indices in a given list of integers. This involves iterating through the list, checking for odd numbers at even indices, and summing them up. We will use Python's built-in functions and avoid unnecessary complexity to ensure efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd numbers', 'even indices'\n    In the requirement, 'odd numbers' refers to integers that are not divisible by 2, and 'even indices' refers to the positions in the list that are multiples of 2 (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Iterate through the list with a step of 2 to cover only even indices.\n    (2) Check if the number at the current index is odd.\n    (3) If it is odd, add it to a running sum.\n    (4) Continue until all even indices are checked.\n    (5) Return the sum of all odd numbers found at even indices.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6]) = 16\n    Explanation: The odd numbers at even indices are 1, 3, 5, and 7. Their sum is 16.\n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no odd numbers at even indices in this list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic already correctly handles lists with no odd numbers at even indices by returning 0.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef solution(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of odd numbers located at even indices.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (List[int]): A list of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of odd numbers at even indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for index in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices\n        if lst[index] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number at the even index is odd\n            total_sum += lst[index]\n    \n    return total_sum\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 93, "repair_prompt": ["def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a list of integers that is not empty, return the sum of all the odd numbers situated at even indices.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0\n    '''", " def solution(lst):\n    '''Given a list of integers that is not empty, return the sum of all the odd numbers situated at even indices.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n    '''", " def solution(lst):\n    '''Given a list of integers that is not empty, return the sum of all the odd numbers situated at even indices.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 93}
