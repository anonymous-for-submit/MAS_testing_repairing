This functionality is straightforward and focuses on string manipulation and conditional logic.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to reverse the case of letters and keep non-letter characters unchanged.\n- If the string contains no letters, reverse the entire string.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and handles edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only non-letter characters.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy testing and demonstration of the function.\nWe will implement the function by first checking if the string contains any letters. If it does, we will iterate through each character, reversing the case of letters and leaving non-letter characters unchanged. If the string contains no letters, we will reverse the entire string. This approach ensures that the function meets the requirements efficiently and handles edge cases effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case reversal': This involves changing the case of a letter from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.\n    'string manipulation': This includes checking for the presence of letters, iterating through characters, and reversing the string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function should first check if the string contains any letters. If it does, iterate through each character, reversing the case of letters and leaving non-letter characters unchanged. If the string contains no letters, reverse the entire string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    Explanation: The string contains no letters, so the entire string is reversed.\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so their cases are reversed.\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters and special characters. Letters are reversed in case, while special characters remain unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the case where the string contains no letters.\n"], "scores": [0.4453, 0.8672, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [57, 111, 128, 0, 0, 0, 128, 128, 128, 128], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solve(s: str) -> str:\n    def is_letter(char: str) -> bool:\n        return char.isalpha()\n\n    def reverse_case(char: str) -> str:\n        return char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()\n\n    if not any(is_letter(char) for char in s):\n        return s[::-1]\n\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if is_letter(char):\n            result.append(reverse_case(char))\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 593, "repair_prompt": ["def solve(s):\t\n'''You are given a string s.
