The competitive analysis shows that there is a need for a function that combines both palindrome checking and weight checking in a user-friendly manner.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should check if the list is a palindrome.\n- The function should check if the sum of the list's elements is less than or equal to the given weight.\n- The function should provide clear and concise feedback to the user.\n- The function should handle edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with non-numeric elements.\n- The function should be easy to understand and use.\nWe will implement the function using Python's built-in capabilities and the 'collections' module for handling the list as a deque, which is efficient for checking palindromes. The function will first check if the list is a palindrome and then check if the sum of its elements is within the given weight limit. We will use Python's type hints to ensure clarity in function signatures.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindrome': a sequence that reads the same backward as forward\n    'sum': the total of all elements in a sequence\n    'weight limit': the maximum allowable total sum of elements in a sequence\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the sum of elements must be strictly greater than the weight limit to return False\n    'less than or equal to': indicates that the sum of elements must be less than or equal to the weight limit to return True\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'less than or equal': emphasizes the requirement for the sum of elements to be within the weight limit\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - First, check if the list is a palindrome.\n    - Then, calculate the sum of the elements in the list.\n    - Finally, compare the sum with the weight limit to determine the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    will_it_fly([], 5) = False\n    Explanation: An empty list cannot be a palindrome, so it immediately fails the first condition.\n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 10) = True\n    Explanation: The list is a palindrome, and the sum of its elements (1+2+3+2+1=9) is less than the weight limit.\n    will_it_fly([4, 4, 4], 12) = True\n    Explanation: The list is a palindrome, and the sum of its elements (4+4+4=12) is equal to the weight limit.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle cases where the list is empty or where the sum of elements equals the weight limit.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: List[int], w: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the list is a palindrome\n    def is_palindrome(lst: List[int]) -> bool:\n        return lst == lst[::-1]\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of elements in the list\n    total_sum = sum(q)\n    \n    # Check if the list is a palindrome and if the sum is within the weight limit\n    if is_palindrome(q) and total_sum <= w:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\n# will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 10) should return True\n# will_it_fly([4, 4, 4], 12) should return True\n# will_it_fly([], 5) should return False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 831, "repair_prompt": ["def will_it_fly(q,w):\t\n'''Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
