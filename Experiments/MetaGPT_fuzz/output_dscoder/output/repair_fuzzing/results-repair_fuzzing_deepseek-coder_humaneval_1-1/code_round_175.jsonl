This is a straightforward mathematical problem that can be solved using a simple algorithm. The function should return an integer that is the largest divisor of n.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly implement the function to find the largest divisor.\n- The function should handle both small and large numbers efficiently.\n- The function should be tested with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\n- The function should include proper documentation and comments.\n- The function should be integrated into a larger application if necessary.\nTo implement the function `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`, we will use a straightforward approach. We will iterate from `n-1` down to `1` to find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`. This method ensures that we check all possible divisors efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'largest divisor': means the greatest number that divides the given number `n` without leaving a remainder, and it should be smaller than `n`.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`, we can use a simple loop that starts from `n-1` and decrements until it finds a divisor. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    1. Start with `divisor = n - 1`\n    2. Check if `n % divisor == 0`\n    3. If true, return `divisor`\n    4. Decrement `divisor` and repeat the check\n    5. If no divisor is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen since `1` will always be a divisor), return `-1` or an appropriate value indicating an error.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_divisor(1) = -1\n    Explanation: Since 1 is not smaller than `n` and is always a divisor, the function should return `-1` or raise an error to indicate that no valid largest divisor exists for `n` in this case.\n    largest_divisor(2) = 1\n    Explanation: The largest divisor of `2` that is smaller than `2` is `1`, which is a valid divisor.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where `n` is `1`.\n        if n == 1:\n            return -1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the largest divisor of a given number n that is smaller than n.
