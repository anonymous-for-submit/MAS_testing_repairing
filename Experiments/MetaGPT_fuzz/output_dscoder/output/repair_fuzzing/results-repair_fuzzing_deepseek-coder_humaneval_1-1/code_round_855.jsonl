We will iterate from n-1 down to 1, checking each number to see if it divides n evenly. The first number that divides n without a remainder will be the largest divisor less than n. This approach is simple and ensures we find the largest divisor efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'divisor': a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, we need to find the largest number that can divide the given number `n` evenly, and this number should be smaller than `n`.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the largest divisor of a given number `n` that is smaller than `n`, we can use a straightforward approach.

Among these, the largest is 4.\n    largest_divisor(1) = -1\n    Explanation: Since 1 is not smaller than 1, and the only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, which does not satisfy the condition of being smaller than `n`, the function should return -1.\n    largest_divisor(10) = 5\n    Explanation: The numbers that divide 10 evenly and are smaller than 10 are 1, 2, 5. Among these, the largest is 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
