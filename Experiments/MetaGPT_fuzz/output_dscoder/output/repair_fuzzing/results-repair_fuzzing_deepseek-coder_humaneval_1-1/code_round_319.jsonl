For a given number, its prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to result in the original number.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, we need to find the largest prime factor of a given integer n. This involves identifying the prime numbers that can divide n and then determining which of these primes is the largest.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of times a prime factor appears must be greater than or equal to the prime factor itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself in the list. This means that if a number appears 3 times, it must be at least 3.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find the largest integer that appears more than once in the list. This means we are looking for the biggest number that meets the frequency condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Create a function to check if a number is prime.\n    2. Iterate through potential factors starting from 2 up to the square root of n.\n    3. For each factor, check if it is a prime and if it divides n.\n    4. Keep track of the largest prime factor found.\n    5. Return the largest prime factor.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(13195) = 29\n    Explanation: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29. The largest of these is 29.\n    largest_prime_factor(2048) = 2\n    Explanation: The prime factors of 2048 are all powers of 2. The largest prime factor is 2.\n    largest_prime_factor(1) = -1\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that n is greater than 1 and not a prime, we assume that n is always greater than 1. Therefore, if n were 1, the function should return -1 as there are no prime factors.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already accounts for the case where n is greater than 1 and not a prime.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the largest prime factor of a given number. The function should be efficient and handle both small and large numbers. The output should be clear and easy to understand. The function should be robust and not crash when dealing with large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to find the largest prime factor efficiently.\n- Ensure the function can handle large numbers without crashing.\n- Provide clear and concise output for the largest prime factor.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for input and output.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance and scalability.\nTo efficiently find the largest prime factor of a given number, we will use a combination of trial division and optimization techniques. We will leverage Python's built-in capabilities for handling large integers and implement a function that iteratively divides the number by its smallest prime factors until the largest prime factor is found.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime factor': A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number. For a given number, its prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to result in the original number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the largest prime factor of a given number `n`, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    2. Divide `n` by this prime number as long as it is divisible.\n    3. Increment the prime number by 1 and repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.\n    4. The largest prime number that divides `n` at the end of this process is the largest prime factor.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(15) = 5\n    Explanation: The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. The largest prime factor is 5.\n    largest_prime_factor(29) = 29\n    Explanation: 29 is a prime number, so its largest prime factor is itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The given logic will correctly handle the case where `n` is a prime number, as it explicitly assumes `n` is not a prime.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    Returns the largest prime factor of n.\n    Args:\n        n (int): A positive integer greater than 1.\n    Returns:\n        int: The largest prime factor of n.\n    '''\n    # Initialize the largest prime factor\n    largest_factor = None\n    \n    # Handle the case where n is even\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        largest_factor = 2\n        n //= 2\n    \n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    factor = 3\n    while factor * factor <= n:\n        while n % factor == 0:\n            largest_factor = factor\n            n //= factor\n        factor += 2\n    \n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        largest_factor = n\n    \n    return largest_factor\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 319, "repair_prompt": ["def largest_prime_factor(n: int):\t\n'''Return the largest prime factor of n.
