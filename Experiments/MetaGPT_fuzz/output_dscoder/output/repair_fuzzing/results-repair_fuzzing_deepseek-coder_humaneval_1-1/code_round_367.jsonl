There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. You can exchange as many elements as needed from lst1 and lst2. However, the focus should be on transforming lst1 into a list of even numbers. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be

The approach involves checking the parity of numbers in both lists and managing exchanges to achieve the desired transformation.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'exchange of elements': means swapping elements between two lists to achieve a specific condition.\n    'list of even numbers': means all elements in the list are even.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No specific degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `exchange(lst1, lst2)`, we need to:\n    1. Check if all elements in `lst1` are even.\n    2. If not, identify elements in `lst1` that can be replaced by elements from `lst2` to make all elements in `lst1` even.\n    3. Perform the necessary exchanges to achieve the goal.\n\n# [edge case]\n    exchange([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]) = True\n    Explanation: We can exchange the first element of `lst1` (1) with the first element of `lst2` (2), making `lst1` all even.\n\n    exchange([2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5]) = True\n    Explanation: `lst1` is already all even, so no exchanges are needed.\n\n    exchange([1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5]) = False\n    Explanation: `lst1` contains only odd numbers, and no exchanges can make it all even.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The core logic can determine if the transformation is possible based on the initial conditions.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to determine if lst1 can be transformed into a list of even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2. The solution should be efficient and provide a clear output indicating the possibility of the transformation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function that checks the possibility of transforming lst1 into a list of even numbers.\n- Ensure minimal exchanges between lst1 and lst2 to achieve the transformation.\n- Provide a clear and concise output indicating the possibility of the transformation.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle large datasets efficiently.\n- Include detailed logging for debugging purposes.\nTo solve this problem, we will use a straightforward approach that focuses on checking the possibility of transforming lst1 into a list of even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2. We will iterate through lst1 and check if each element can be replaced by an even number from lst2. If all elements in lst1 can be made even, we will return 'YES'; otherwise, we will return 'NO'.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'exchange elements': means to swap numbers between two lists to achieve a specific condition.\n    'even numbers': means numbers divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Iterate through each element in lst1.\n    - For each element in lst1, check if there is an even number in lst2 that can replace it.\n    - If all elements in lst1 can be replaced with even numbers from lst2, return \"YES\".\n    - If any element in lst1 cannot be replaced with an even number from lst2, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    exchange([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]) = \"YES\"\n    Explanation: Since lst1 contains only odd numbers and lst2 contains only even numbers, we can exchange all elements in lst1 with elements from lst2 to make lst1 all even.\n    exchange([2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5]) = \"YES\"\n    Explanation: lst1 is already all even, so no exchange is needed.\n    exchange([1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5]) = \"NO\"\n    Explanation: lst1 contains only odd numbers and lst2 contains the same odd numbers. No exchange can make lst1 all even.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
