The user examples provided are for testing the function's correctness and robustness. The requirements are clear and specific, focusing on the functionality and expected behavior of the function.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly compute 2^n modulo p for various values of n and p.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as n=0 and large numbers efficiently.\n- The function should be optimized for performance and memory usage.\n- The function should include error handling for invalid inputs.\nTo implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in `pow` function which is optimized for performance and handles large numbers. This function computes `(2^n) % p` using an algorithm that is both fast and memory-efficient.
