The function will be straightforward, focusing on summing integers from 1 to n. We will ensure it gracefully handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zero by validating the input at the start of the function.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'summing numbers from 1 to n'\n    The core concept involves adding all integers from 1 up to the given integer n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function `sum_to_n(n: int)` can be implemented using a simple arithmetic progression formula or a loop to sum the numbers from 1 to n. The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

This can be efficiently done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (n * (n + 1)) / 2. This formula is efficient and handles edge cases like negative numbers and zero gracefully.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 0 is not a positive integer and is not in the range of numbers to be summed, the function should return 0 to handle this edge case gracefully.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Negative numbers are not positive integers, so the function should return 0 to handle this edge case gracefully.\n    sum_to_n(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is simply 1, so the function should return 1 to handle this edge case gracefully.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The formula (n * (n + 1)) / 2 already gracefully handles negative numbers and zero by returning 0, which is the correct output for these cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers to be summed.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 541, "repair_prompt": ["def sum_to_n(n: int):\t\n'''sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
