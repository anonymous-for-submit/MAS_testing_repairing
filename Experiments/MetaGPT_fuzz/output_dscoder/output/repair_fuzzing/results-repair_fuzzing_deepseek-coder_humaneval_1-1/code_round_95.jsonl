{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. If the previous term is odd, the next term becomes 3 times the previous term plus 1. This operation results in an increase, creating a new term that is larger than the starting term. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nNote: \n    1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n    2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    '''", "entry_point": "get_odd_collatz", "canonical_solution": "    if n%2==0:\n        odd_collatz = [] \n    else:\n        odd_collatz = [n]\n    while n > 1:\n        if n % 2
