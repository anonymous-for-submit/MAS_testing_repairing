Return `True` if the result is a whole number, otherwise return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    simplify('1/2', '3/4') = False\n    Explanation: The expression '1/2' * '3/4' evaluates to '3/8', which is not a whole number. Therefore, the function should return `False`.\n    simplify('2/3', '3/2') = True\n    Explanation: The expression '2/3' * '3/2' evaluates to '6/6', which is a whole number. Therefore, the function should return `True`.\n    simplify('5/1', '2/1') = True\n    Explanation: The expression '5/1' * '2/1' evaluates to '10/1', which is a whole number. Therefore, the function should return `True`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases, as the logic provided in the plan can handle all valid inputs including the edge cases mentioned.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that takes two string representations of fractions, multiplies them, and checks if the result is a whole number. The function should handle valid fractions and return True if the product is a whole number, and False otherwise. The fractions are guaranteed to have non-zero denominators.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly multiply two fractions and check if the result is a whole number.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as invalid inputs gracefully.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\nTo implement the function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle string manipulation and arithmetic operations. The function will parse the input strings to extract numerators and denominators, perform the multiplication, and then check if the result is a whole number. We will use the math library to handle the division and ensure precision.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'fraction': A fraction represents a part of a whole, expressed as a ratio of two integers, the numerator and the denominator.\n    'multiplication': The operation of combining two fractions to get a single fraction.\n    'whole number': An integer that does not have a fractional component, i.e., it is not a fraction.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Parse the input strings to extract numerators and denominators.\n    - Convert the string fractions to floating-point numbers for precise multiplication.\n    - Multiply the numerators and denominators.\n    - Check if the resulting product is a whole number.\n    - Return True if it is a whole number, False otherwise.\n\n# [edge case] \n    simplify(\"1/2\", \"2/1\") = True\n    Explanation: The multiplication of 1/2 and 2/1 results in 1, which is a whole number.\n    simplify(\"3/4\", \"4/3\") = True\n    Explanation: The multiplication of 3/4 and 4/3 results in 1, which is a whole number.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
