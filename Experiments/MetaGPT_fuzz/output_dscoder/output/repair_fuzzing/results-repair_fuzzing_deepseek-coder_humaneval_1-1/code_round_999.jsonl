This method ensures that we find the largest prime factor efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime factor': A prime factor is a factor of a given number that is a prime number. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find the greatest prime factor of a given number. This involves identifying the largest prime number that divides the given number without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find a prime factor that is greater than the other factors.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find the largest prime factor, which means we are looking for a prime factor that is greater than any other prime factors.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the prime factor that is the largest among all the prime factors.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find the greatest prime factor, which means we are looking for the largest prime number that divides the given number.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the largest prime factor, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    2. Divide the given number by this prime number and check if it leaves a remainder.\n    3. If it does not leave a remainder, then this prime number is a factor.\n    4. Continue dividing the number by this prime factor until it is no longer divisible by this prime number.\n    5. Move to the next potential prime factor and repeat the process.\n    6. Keep track of the largest prime factor found during the process.\n    7. Return the largest prime factor.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(17) = 17\n    Explanation: Since 17 is a prime number, it does not have any prime factors other than 1 and 17 itself. Therefore, the largest prime factor is 17.\n    largest_prime_factor(1) = None\n    Explanation: The problem statement assumes that n > 1 and is not a prime. Therefore, the function should not be called with n = 1.\n    largest_prime_factor(29) = 29\n    Explanation: Since 29 is a prime number, it does not have any prime factors other than 1 and 29 itself. Therefore, the largest prime factor is 29.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n = 1, as the problem statement specifies that n > 1 and is not a prime.\n    if n == 1:\n        return None\n    (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function to find the largest prime factor of a given number. The function uses a simple algorithm that iterates through possible divisors starting from 2. The requirements are clear and concise, focusing on functionality and correctness.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly identify the largest prime factor of a given number.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large numbers efficiently.\n- The code should include detailed documentation to aid users in understanding and using the function.\n- The function should be tested to ensure it handles edge cases and provides accurate results.\n- The user interface should be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to input and understand outputs.\nTo create an efficient algorithm for finding the largest prime factor of a given number, we will use a simple and optimized approach that iteratively divides the number by its smallest prime factor until the number itself becomes a prime. This method leverages the fact that the smallest prime factor of a number is always less than or equal to its square root. We will utilize Python's built-in capabilities to ensure the code is both readable and optimized.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime factor': A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number. For example, the prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the greatest prime divisor of a given number, which means finding the largest prime number that divides the given number without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find the largest prime number that is a factor of the given number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': means that we need to find the largest prime number among all the prime factors of the given number.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The provided plan outlines a logical approach to find the largest prime factor:\n    1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n    2. Check if the current number `n` is divisible by the current prime number `i`.\n    3. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is a prime factor. Divide `n` by `i` and continue the process.\n    4. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, increment `i` to check the next potential prime factor.\n    5. Continue this process until `i * i` is greater than `n`, ensuring all possible prime factors are found.\n    6. Return the remaining `n` as the largest prime factor since it is a prime number itself.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_prime_factor(1) = None\n    Explanation: Since the requirement specifies that `n > 1` and `n` is not a prime, the function should return `None` or raise an exception for `n = 1` because it does not have any prime factors.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if n <= 1:\n            return None  # or raise ValueError(\"n must be greater than 1\")\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    '''Return the greatest prime divisor of the number n.
