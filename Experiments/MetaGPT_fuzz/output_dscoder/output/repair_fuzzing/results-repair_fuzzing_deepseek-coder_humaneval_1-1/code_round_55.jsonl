The solution should be efficient and handle large datasets.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to find the smallest even value in an array.\n- Ensure the function returns the index of the smallest even value.\n- Handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values.\n- Optimize the function for large datasets to ensure performance.\n- Ensure the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\nTo implement the function `pluck` efficiently, we will utilize Python's built-in capabilities and the `typing` module to ensure type hints are clear and concise. The function will iterate through the array to find the smallest even value, considering the index for tie-breaking. We will handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values by returning an empty list in such scenarios.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'smallest even value': means the smallest value among the even numbers in the list.\n    'smallest index': means the position of the smallest even value in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': means the smallest value among the even numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Iterate through the array to find the smallest even value and its index. If no even values are found, return an empty list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([4, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([1, 2, 3]) = [2, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and it has the smallest index of 1.\n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so there are no even values to pluck.\n    pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) = [0, 1]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 0, and there are two zeros, so we choose the first zero which has the smallest index of 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic can handle the edge cases by returning an empty list when there are no even values or the array is empty.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\ndef pluck(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    min_even: Optional[int] = None\n    min_index: int = -1\n\n    for index, value in enumerate(arr):\n        if value % 2 == 0:\n            if min_even is None or value < min_even or (value == min_even and index < min_index):\n                min_even = value\n                min_index = index\n\n    if min_even is not None:\n        return [min_even, min_index]\n    else:\n        return []\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 55, "repair_prompt": ["def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes, your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
