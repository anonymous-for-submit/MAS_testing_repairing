Otherwise, replace a with b and b with a modulo b.\n    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until b becomes 0.\n    4. The value of a at this point is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The GCD of 0 and any positive integer is the integer itself. This is because any number is divisible by itself and 0.\n    greatest_common_divisor(12, 0) = 12\n    Explanation: The GCD of any non-zero integer and 0 is the non-zero integer itself.\n    greatest_common_divisor(17, 13) = 1\n    Explanation: Since 17 and 13 have no common divisors other than 1, their GCD is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case where one of the inputs is 0, as the Euclidean algorithm inherently handles this case correctly. The algorithm will return the non-zero number as the GCD.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116, 116], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nimport math\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The greatest common divisor of the two integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 606, "repair_prompt": ["def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\t\n'''Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
