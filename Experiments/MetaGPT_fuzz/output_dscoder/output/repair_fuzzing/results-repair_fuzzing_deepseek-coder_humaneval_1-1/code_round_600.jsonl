This is an edge case where the number of carrots left is negative after eating.\n\n    eat(5, 6, 10) = [10, 4]\n    Explanation: The rabbit eats 5 more carrots to reach a total of 10 eaten.

If it does, set the number of carrots left to zero and adjust the total number of carrots eaten accordingly.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(2, 11, 5) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 2 carrots initially and needs 11 more. There are only 5 remaining carrots. The function calculates the total number of carrots eaten as 2 + 9 (the maximum needed to meet the requirement) = 11, and the number of carrots left is 5 - 9 (the maximum needed) = -4. Since the number of carrots left cannot be negative, it is set to 0, and the total number of carrots eaten is adjusted to 7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
