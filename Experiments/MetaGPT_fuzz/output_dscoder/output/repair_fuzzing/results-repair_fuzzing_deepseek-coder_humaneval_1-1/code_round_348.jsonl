prime numbers. This is a specific mathematical problem that needs to be solved efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function to check if a number is prime and another to check if it can be expressed as the product of 3 prime numbers.\n- Implement a function that generates prime numbers up to 100 for use in the main function.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance, especially for numbers close to 100.\nTo solve the problem of checking if a number less than 100 can be expressed as the product of 3 prime numbers, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the sympy library for prime number generation and checking.

Define a helper function to check if a number is prime.\n    2. Iterate through numbers less than 100 to find three prime numbers whose product equals `a`.\n    3. Return `True` if such a combination is found, otherwise return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_multiply_prime(105) = False\n    Explanation: 105 cannot be expressed as the product of three prime numbers because the largest prime number less than 100 is 97, and the product of three 97's is 912673, which is much larger than 105.\n    is_multiply_prime(30) = True\n    Explanation: 30 can be expressed as the product of 2, 3, and 5 (all prime numbers).\n    is_multiply_prime(1) = False\n    Explanation: 1 cannot be expressed as the product of any prime numbers, as prime numbers are defined to be greater than 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The function will naturally return `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1, as they cannot be expressed as the product of three prime numbers.\n"], "scores": [0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 0.8393, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 56], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:\n    # Function to check if a number is prime\n    def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        if n <= 3:\n            return True\n        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n            return False\n        i = 5\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n                return False\n            i += 6\n        return True\n\n    # Check if a can be expressed as the product of 3 prime numbers\n    for i in range(2, 100):\n        if not is_prime(i):\n            continue\n        for j in range(i, 100):\n            if not is_prime(j):\n                continue\n            for k in range(j, 100):\n                if not is_prime(k):\n                    continue\n                if i * j * k == a:\n                    return True\n    return False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 348, "repair_prompt": ["def is_multiply_prime(a):\t\n'''Write a function that returns true if the provided number can be expressed as the product of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.
