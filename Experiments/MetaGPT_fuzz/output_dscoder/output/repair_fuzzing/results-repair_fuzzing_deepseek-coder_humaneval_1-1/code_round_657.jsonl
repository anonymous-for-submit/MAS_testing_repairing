Return a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 has one even digit (0) and no odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(13579) = (0, 5)\n    Explanation: The number 13579 has no even digits and five odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(-24680) = (4, 1)\n    Explanation: The number -24680 has four even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) and one odd digit (0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the logic provided covers all necessary scenarios.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5316, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 42, 79, 79, 79], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef even_odd_count(num: int) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of even and odd digits in the given integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The integer to count even and odd digits in.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the count of even digits and the count of odd digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the integer to a string and handle negative numbers\n    num_str = str(abs(num))\n    \n    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string representation of the number\n    for char in num_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        if digit % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the counts of even and odd digits\n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(even_odd_count(123456))  # Output: (3, 3)\n# print(even_odd_count(24680))   # Output: (5, 0)\n# print(even_odd_count(-13579))  # Output: (0, 5)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 657, "repair_prompt": ["def even_odd_count(num):\t\n'''Given an integer.
