The difference between any two numbers is greater than 0.5, so the function should return `False`.\n    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) = True\n    Explanation: Here, the threshold is 0.3. The numbers include 1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 2.0. The difference between 2.8 and 3.0 is 0.2, which is less than 0.3. Therefore, the function should return `True`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can handle cases where the list has fewer elements or where the threshold is very small, but these are edge cases that do not require additional code beyond the basic logic.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to check if there are any two numbers in a list that are closer to each other than a given threshold. This is a fundamental check that can be used in various applications, including data analysis and game development. The function should be efficient and handle both small and large lists of numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check for close elements\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance\n- Document the function with examples and edge cases\n- Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness\n- Integrate the function into a simple application for demonstration\nWe will use the Python standard library to implement the function efficiently. The function will iterate through the list of numbers and compare each number with every other number to check if their difference is less than the given threshold. This approach is simple and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for handling lists and comparisons.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'closer to each other than given threshold'\n    In the requirement, it means that the absolute difference between any two numbers in the list should be less than the provided threshold.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the list of numbers and comparing each number with every other number. This can be done using nested loops to ensure all pairs are checked.\n\n# [edge case] \n    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) = False\n    Explanation: The difference between any two numbers in the list is greater than 0.5, so the function should return False.\n    has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) = True\n    Explanation: The difference between 2.8 and 3.0 is 0.2, which is less than the threshold of 0.3. Therefore, the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
