The function should consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' as vowels, and 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. This requirement is clear and concise, focusing on a specific functionality.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately count the number of vowels in the input string.\n- Implement the function to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n- Ensure the function correctly identifies 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large input strings efficiently.\n- Include unit tests to verify the correctness of the function.\nWe will use a straightforward approach to implement the vowels_count function. The function will iterate through the input string, check each character to see if it is a vowel, and count the vowels. We will ensure that the function is case-insensitive by converting the input string to lowercase before counting. To handle the special case for 'y' being a vowel only at the end of the word, we will check the position of 'y' in the string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'vowels': 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n    Explanation: The core concept here is identifying and counting the vowels in a given string.
