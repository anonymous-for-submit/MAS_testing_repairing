This is crucial in cryptography and certain mathematical computations where large numbers and their modular reductions are common.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function efficiently, we can use Python's built-in capabilities for handling large integers. We will use the fast exponentiation method (exponentiation by squaring) to compute \\(2^n \\mod p\\). This method reduces the number of multiplications and is particularly efficient for large exponents.\n\n    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n    1. Initialize a result variable to 1.\n    2. Convert the exponent \\(n\\) to its binary representation.\n    3.

This approach will naturally handle large inputs without the need for specialized libraries, thus optimizing for performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'modular arithmetic'\n    Explanation: Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic that deals with integers modulo a number, called the modulus. It is used in number theory, cryptography, and computer science. The operation `2^n % p` calculates the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n, p)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Compute `2^n` using the `**` operator.\n    2. Use the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n    3. Return the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1000, 1000) = 128\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the function's ability to handle large numbers. `2^1000` is a very large number, but Python's `int` type can handle it without overflow. The result is the remainder when `2^1000` is divided by 1000.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. Python's built-in `int` type can handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'arbitrary-precision integers'\n    Explanation: Python's `int` type supports arbitrary-precision integers, meaning it can handle very large numbers without overflow. This is crucial for tasks like computing large powers and taking their modulo, which is essential for the `modp` function.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n, p)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Return the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(0, 1) = 0\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the function's behavior when `n` is 0. Since `2^0` is 1, the result of `1 % 1` is 0, which is the expected output.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The function correctly handles `2^0 % 1` as 0.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'performance optimization'\n    Explanation: The function `modp(n, p)` is optimized for performance by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for handling large integers.

Return the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(3, 0) = ValueError\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the function's behavior when `p` is 0. Since division by zero is undefined, the function should raise a `ValueError` to indicate an invalid input.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if p == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Modulus p must be non-zero.\")\n\n# [core concept]\n    'error handling'\n    Explanation: Error handling is crucial for ensuring that the function can handle invalid inputs gracefully. In this case, the function should raise a `ValueError` when the modulus `p` is zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n, p)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Return the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(-1, 5) = 4\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the function's behavior when `n` is negative. Since `2^-1` is equivalent to `1/2`, and in modulo 5, `1/2` is equivalent to `4` (since `2 * 2 = 4` and `4 % 5 = 4`).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
