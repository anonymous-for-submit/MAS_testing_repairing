analysis:\nThe requirement is to check if a given string is considered 'happy' based on specific conditions. The string must be at least 3 characters long, and every 3 successive characters must be unique. This requirement ensures that the string meets the criteria for being considered 'happy'.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to check if the string is happy\n- Ensure the function handles strings of varying lengths\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for input and output\n- Test the function with various inputs to ensure accuracy\n- Optimize the function for performance and efficiency\nWe will implement the function `is_happy` using Python, leveraging the simplicity and readability of the language to ensure the function is easy to understand and maintain. The function will check if the given string meets the criteria of being 'happy' by ensuring it is at least 3 characters long and that every 3 successive characters are unique.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'unique': means that each set of three consecutive characters in the string must be distinct.\n    'minimum length': means that the string must be at least 3 characters long.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_happy`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If so, return `False` because it doesn't meet the minimum length requirement.\n    2. Iterate through the string `s` in steps of 3 up to the third last character.\n    3. For each set of three consecutive characters, check if they are all unique.\n    4. If any set of three consecutive characters is not unique, return `False`.\n    5.
