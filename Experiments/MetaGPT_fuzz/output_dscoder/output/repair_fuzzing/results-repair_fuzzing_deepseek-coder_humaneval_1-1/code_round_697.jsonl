The function will iterate through each character in the string, check if it's a letter, and toggle its case. If no letters are found, it will reverse the string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case alteration': changing the case of a letter from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa.\n    'reversing a string': flipping the order of characters in a string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Iterate through each character in the string.\n    - Check if the character is a letter.\n    - If it is a letter, toggle its case.\n    - If no letters are found, reverse the string.\n    - Return the resulted string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    Explanation: The string contains no letters, so the function reverses the string.\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so the function toggles the case of each letter.\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    Explanation: The string contains letters, so the function toggles the case of each letter.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers the case where no letters are present.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solve(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    has_letters = False\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            has_letters = True\n            if char.islower():\n                result.append(char.upper())\n            else:\n                result.append(char.lower())\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n\n    if not has_letters:\n        result.reverse()\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 697, "repair_prompt": ["def solve(s):\t\n'''You are given a string s.\n    if s[i] is a letter, alter its case from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa, \n    otherwise keep it as it is.\n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\n    The function should return the resulted string.\nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    '''", " You are given a string s.\nif s[i] is a letter, alter its case from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa, \notherwise keep it as it is.\nIf the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\nThe function should return the resulted string.\nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    \ndef solve(s):\t\n    '''You are given a string s.\n    if s[i] is a", " You are given a string s.\nif s[i] is a letter, alter its case from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa, \notherwise keep it as it is.\nIf the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\nThe function should return the resulted string.\nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\""], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 442}
