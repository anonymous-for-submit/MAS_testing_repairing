The function will iterate through the list, checking each element's position and value, and summing those that are odd and located at even indices.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd elements', 'even positions'\n    In the requirement, 'odd elements' refers to integers that are not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1 when divided by 2), and 'even positions' refer to indices that are even (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should iterate through the list, checking each element's position and value. If the element is odd and its position is even, it should be added to the sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1, 3, 5, 7]) = 8\n    Explanation: The odd elements at even positions are 1 (at position 0) and 5 (at position 2). Their sum is 6.\n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8]) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no odd elements at even positions in this list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle cases where there are no odd elements at even positions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not lst:\n            return 0\n        sum_odd_at_even = 0\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n                sum_odd_at_even += lst[i]\n        return sum_odd_at_even\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the sum of all odd elements located at even positions in a list of integers. This involves iterating through the list, checking the position and value of each element, and summing those that meet the criteria.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to sum odd elements at even positions\n- Ensure the function works correctly for various list sizes and compositions\n- Include tests to verify the function's correctness\n- Optimize the function for efficiency\n- Document the function and its usage\nTo implement the function that calculates the sum of all odd elements located at even positions in a list of integers, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and ensure the function is efficient. We will iterate through the list, check each element's position and value, and sum those that meet the criteria.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'odd elements at even positions': means elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) that are odd.\n    Explanation: We need to identify numbers that are odd and located at even indices in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Iterate through the list, check if the index is even and the value is odd, and sum those values.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 4\n    Explanation: The odd elements at even positions are at indices 0 and 2. Their values are 1 and 3, respectively. The sum is 1 + 3 = 4.\n    solution([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) = 0\n    Explanation: There are no odd elements at even positions in this list. All elements are even.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic to sum odd elements at even positions is straightforward and does not require additional handling for this specific case.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef solution(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of all odd elements located at even positions in a list of integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (List[int]): A list of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all odd elements located at even positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n        if index % 2 == 0 and value % 2 != 0:\n            total_sum += value\n            \n    return total_sum\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 520, "repair_prompt": ["def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a non-empty list of integers, calculate the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0\n    '''", " def solution(lst):\t\n'''Given a non-empty list of integers, calculate the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\nExamples\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n    '''\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 2 == 0", " def solution(lst):\n    '''Given a non-empty list of integers, calculate the sum of all the odd elements located at even positions.\n    Examples\n        solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\n        solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\n        solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==> 0\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 307}
