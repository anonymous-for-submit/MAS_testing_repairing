Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

The steps include defining the list of prime numbers, iterating through the input number, checking if each character is a hexadecimal digit, and then checking if it's a prime number. Finally, counting and returning the prime digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge cases should be considered to ensure the function handles all possible inputs correctly.\n    Edge case 1: `hex_key(\"1A3F\")`\n        Explanation: The hexadecimal digits are 1, A, 3, F.
