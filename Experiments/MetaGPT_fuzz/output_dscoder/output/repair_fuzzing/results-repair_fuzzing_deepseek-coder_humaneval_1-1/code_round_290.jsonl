The function will iterate through the list, check each element to see if it is greater than zero, and collect these elements into a new list which will be returned as the result.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive integers'\n    In the requirement, it means that we are only interested in numbers that are greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the list and checking each element to see if it is greater than zero. If it is, the element should be added to a new list. This can be done using a simple for loop or a list comprehension.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_positive([-1, -2, -3]) = []\n    Explanation: Since all numbers in the list are less than or equal to zero, the function should return an empty list.\n    get_positive([0, 0, 0]) = []\n    Explanation: Even though the list contains numbers, none of them are greater than zero, so the function should return an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic of checking each element and adding it to the result list if it is greater than zero will naturally handle these cases by returning an empty list.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that filters out only positive numbers from a given list. The function should be efficient and handle both typical and edge cases effectively. The user interface should be simple and intuitive to use.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly identify and return only positive numbers from the list\n- The function should handle large lists efficiently without slowing down\n- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use\n- The application should handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with no positive numbers\n- The application should be compatible with a variety of input data types\nTo create a function that filters out only positive numbers from a given list efficiently, we will utilize Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the power of list comprehensions for simplicity and performance. This approach ensures that the function is both easy to read and maintain, while also being efficient enough to handle large lists without slowing down.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive integers'\n    In the requirement, it means that we are only interested in numbers that are greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using a list comprehension to filter out positive numbers from the list.
