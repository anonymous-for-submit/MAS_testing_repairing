The function will first split the input sentence into words, then check each word's length for primality, and finally return a string containing only the words with prime lengths.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'prime number': A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Split the sentence into words.\n    - Check each word's length for primality.\n    - Collect words with prime lengths.\n    - Join the filtered words back into a string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    words_in_sentence(\"hello world\") = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: The word \"hello\" has a length of 5, which is a prime number.
