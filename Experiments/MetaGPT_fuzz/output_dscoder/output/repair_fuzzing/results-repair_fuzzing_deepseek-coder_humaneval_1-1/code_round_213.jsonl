Return the new list of coefficients representing the derivative.\n\n# [edge case] \n    derivative([1]) = []\n    Explanation: Since the polynomial has only one coefficient, it represents a constant term (a polynomial of degree 0), and its derivative is 0. Therefore, the output should be an empty list.\n    derivative([0, 1, 2, 3]) = [1, 4, 9]\n    Explanation: The polynomial is x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. The derivative is 3x^2 + 4x + 3, so the output should be [1, 4, 9].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if len(xs) == 1:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. The polynomial is represented by a list where the index of the list item corresponds to the power of x. The derivative of the polynomial should also be represented in the same form. The function should handle polynomials of varying degrees and ensure the derivative is calculated accurately.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly calculate the derivative of the polynomial.\n- The function should handle polynomials of any degree.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for easy input and output.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for large datasets to maintain performance.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs such as non-numeric coefficients.\nTo implement the polynomial derivative function, we will use Python's capabilities to handle lists and arithmetic operations. The function will iterate through the list of coefficients, applying the power rule of differentiation to each term. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1). We will ensure that the function correctly handles polynomials of any degree and includes error handling for invalid inputs such as non-numeric coefficients.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'polynomial': a mathematical expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the function `derivative` is designed to compute the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. The polynomial is represented by a list where each element corresponds to the coefficient of a term with increasing powers of x.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the derivative function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the input list `xs` is empty or contains non-numeric values. If so, return an error message or handle it appropriately.\n    2. Iterate through the list `xs` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.\n    3. For each element, multiply it by its index to get the coefficient of the derivative term.\n    4. Create a new list to store the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n    5. Return the new list representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n\n# [edge case] \n    derivative([]) = \"Error: The input list is empty.\"\n    Explanation: Since the input list is empty, there are no coefficients to differentiate, so an error message is returned.\n    derivative([1, 'a', 3]) = \"Error: All elements in the list must be numeric.\"\n    Explanation: The list contains a non-numeric value ('a'), which prevents the function from correctly computing the derivative, so an error message is returned.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not xs:\n            return \"Error: The input list is empty.\"\n        for coefficient in xs:\n            if not isinstance(coefficient, (int, float)):\n                return \"Error: All elements in the list must be numeric.\"\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the derivative function:\n    ```python\n    def derivative(xs: list):\n        if not xs:\n            return \"Error: The input list is empty.\"\n        for coefficient in xs:\n            if not isinstance(coefficient, (int, float)):\n                return \"Error: All elements in the list must be numeric.\"\n        \n        derivative_coefficients = []\n        for i in range(1, len(xs)):\n            derivative_coefficients.append(xs[i] * i)\n        \n        return derivative_coefficients\n    ```\n"], "scores": [0.9899, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [98, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef derivative(xs: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients.\n\n    Args:\n        xs (list): A list of coefficients representing the polynomial.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not xs:\n        raise ValueError(\"Error: The input list is empty.\")\n    \n    for coefficient in xs:\n        if not isinstance(coefficient, (int, float)):\n            raise ValueError(\"Error: All elements in the list must be numeric.\")\n    \n    derivative_coefficients = []\n    for i in range(1, len(xs)):\n        derivative_coefficients.append(xs[i] * i)\n    \n    return derivative_coefficients\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 213, "repair_prompt": ["def derivative(xs: list):\t\n'''xs represent coefficients of a polynomial. xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
