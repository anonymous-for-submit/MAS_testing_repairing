The function will check if a list is a palindrome and if the sum of its elements is within a specified weight limit. We will handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers to ensure robustness.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindrome': a sequence that reads the same backward as forward\n    'sum': the total of all elements in a list\n    'weight limit': the maximum allowable total sum of elements in a list\n\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the function 'will_it_fly' checks if a list is both balanced (a palindrome) and if its sum of elements is within a specified weight limit.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the sum of elements in the list is greater than the specified weight limit.\n    'less than or equal to': means that the sum of elements in the list is less than or equal to the specified weight limit.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'most': emphasizes the highest possible sum of elements that would still allow the object to fly.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Check if the list is a palindrome.\n    - Calculate the sum of the list's elements.\n    - Compare the sum with the specified weight limit.\n    - Return True if both conditions are met, otherwise return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    will_it_fly([], 5) = False\n    Explanation: An empty list cannot be a palindrome, so it immediately fails the first condition.\n    will_it_fly([-1, -2], 5) = False\n    Explanation: Lists with negative numbers cannot be palindromes, so the function returns False.\n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], -5) = False\n    Explanation: A negative weight limit is not meaningful, so the function should handle this as an error or return False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not q:\n            return False  # An empty list cannot be a palindrome.\n        if w < 0:\n            return False  # A negative weight limit is not valid.\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: list, w: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not q:\n        return False  # An empty list cannot be a palindrome.\n    \n    # Check if the weight limit is negative\n    if w < 0:\n        return False  # A negative weight limit is not valid.\n    \n    # Check if the list is a palindrome\n    is_palindrome = (q == q[::-1])\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the list's elements\n    total_sum = sum(q)\n    \n    # Check if the sum of the list's elements is within the specified weight limit\n    within_limit = (total_sum <= w)\n    \n    # Return True if both conditions are met, otherwise return False\n    return is_palindrome and within_limit\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 386, "repair_prompt": ["def will_it_fly(q,w):\t\n'''Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
