The function should handle incorrect inputs gracefully by returning an empty tuple.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should validate the input planet names and return an error message if the names are incorrect.\n- The function should find the correct position of the given planets in the list and return the planets between them.\n- The function should return an empty tuple if the input planet names are incorrect.\n- The function should be efficient and handle edge cases such as identical input planets.\nWe will implement the function using Python, leveraging the simplicity and readability of the language. The function will validate the input planet names, find the correct position of the given planets in the list, and return the planets between them. We will use a predefined list of planets to ensure accurate and efficient planet data retrieval.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planets': The core concept here is the identification and ordering of planets in the solar system based on their proximity to the Sun.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves identifying and listing planets between two given planets, considering their order in the solar system.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first validate the input planet names to ensure they are part of the known solar system. If valid, it should then find their positions in the list of planets and return the planets between them, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf(\"Pluto\", \"Mars\") = ()\n    Explanation: Since Pluto is not considered a planet by the IAU, the function should return an empty tuple if either planet1 or planet2 is \"Pluto\".\n    bf(\"Sun\", \"Earth\") = ()\n    Explanation: The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 is \"Sun\" or planet2 is \"Earth\" since \"Sun\" is not a planet and \"Earth\" is the first planet.\n    bf(\"InvalidPlanet\", \"Earth\") = ()\n    Explanation: The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 is not a valid planet name, ensuring the function handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the input planet names are invalid or out of order.\n        if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n            return ()\n        if planets.index(planet1) > planets.index(planet2):\n            planet1, planet2 = planet2, planet1\n        (other code)\n\nThis additional code ensures that the function does not attempt to find planets between invalid or out-of-order planet names, providing robust handling of edge cases.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8725, 0.7549, 0.5392, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 89, 77, 55, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef bf(planet1: str, planet2: str) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the planets between two given planets in the solar system, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.\n\n    Args:\n        planet1 (str): The name of the first planet.\n        planet2 (str): The name of the second planet.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the planets between the two given planets, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.\n               If the input planets are invalid or out of order, returns an empty tuple.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Predefined list of planets in the solar system\n    planets = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n\n    # Check if the input planets are valid\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n\n    # Ensure planet1 is before planet2 in the list\n    if planets.index(planet1) > planets.index(planet2):\n        planet1, planet2 = planet2, planet1\n\n    # Find the index positions of the planets\n    start_index = planets.index(planet1)\n    end_index = planets.index(planet2)\n\n    # Retrieve the planets between the two positions\n    result = planets[start_index + 1:end_index]\n\n    return tuple(result)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 459, "repair_prompt": ["def bf(planet1, planet2):\t\n'''There are eight planets in our solar system: the one nearest to the Sun is Mercury, followed by Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
