This approach ensures that the function handles both cases effectively and efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'case reversal': This involves changing the case of a character from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.\n    'string manipulation': This includes checking for specific conditions, iterating through characters, and reversing strings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan involves checking if the string contains any alphabetic characters. If it does, iterate through each character, reversing the case of alphabetic characters. If the string contains no alphabetic characters, reverse the entire string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve(\"\") = \"\"\n    Explanation: The string is empty, so reversing it results in an empty string.\n    solve(\"!@#$\") = \"!@#$\"\n    Explanation: The string contains no alphabetic characters, so it is reversed to itself.\n    solve(\"a1b2\") = \"A1B2\"\n    Explanation: The string contains both letters and numbers. Letters are reversed in case, while numbers remain unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers empty strings and strings with no alphabetic characters.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.7422, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7422], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [128, 128, 95, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 0, 95], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef solve(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return s\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            result.append(char.swapcase())\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 884, "repair_prompt": ["def solve(s):\t\n'''You are given a string s.  \n    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa,  \n    otherwise keep it as it is.  \n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.  \n    The function should return the resulted string.  \n    Consider edge cases where the string may be empty or contain only special characters.\nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    '''", " def solve(s):\t\n    '''You are given a string s.  \n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.  \n    Otherwise, if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vice versa.  \n    Otherwise, keep it as it is.  \n    The function should return the resulted string.  \n    Consider edge cases where the string may be empty or contain only special characters.\nExamples:\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#", " You are given a string s. \nif s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \notherwise keep it as it is. \nIf the string contains no letters, reverse the string. \nThe function should return the resulted string. \nConsider edge cases where the string may be empty or contain only special characters.\nExamples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\""], "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 700}
