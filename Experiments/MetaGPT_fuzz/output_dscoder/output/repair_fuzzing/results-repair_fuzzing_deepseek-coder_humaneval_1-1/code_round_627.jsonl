{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.

If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, we will choose the one with the smallest index. If the array is empty or contains no even values, we will return an empty list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'smallest even value'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the smallest value among the even numbers in the array. If there are multiple even numbers with the same value, the one with the smallest index is chosen.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest'\n    The degree adverb 'smallest' indicates that we need to find the smallest even value in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index.\n    2. Iterate through the array to find the smallest even value.\n    3. If an even value is found, compare it with the current smallest even value and update the index if a smaller value is found.\n    4. If no even value is found, return an empty list.\n    5. Return the smallest even value along with its index.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pluck([]) = []\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so there are no even values to pluck. The expected output is an empty list.\n    pluck([1, 3, 5]) = []\n    Explanation: There are no even values in the array, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    pluck([2, 4, 6]) = [2, 0]\n    Explanation: The smallest even value is 2, and its index is 0. The expected output is [2, 0].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the case where the array is empty or contains no even values.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the smallest even value in an array and return it along with its index. The function should handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values. The solution should be efficient and easy to understand.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function that returns the smallest even value and its index\n- Handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays without even values\n- Ensure the function is efficient and easy to understand\nTo implement the function that finds the smallest even value in an array along with its index, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and the 'sys' module to handle edge cases efficiently. The function will iterate through the array, identify even values, and keep track of the smallest even value and its index.
