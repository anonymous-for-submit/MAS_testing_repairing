This approach leverages Python's simplicity and performance, ensuring that the function is both easy to understand and optimized for performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'summing numbers from 1 to n'\n    The core concept involves adding all integers from 1 up to the given integer n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using Python's built-in capabilities to sum numbers from 1 to n. This can be efficiently achieved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is (n * (n + 1)) / 2. This formula allows for a direct calculation without the need for iteration.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 0 is not a positive integer, the function should return 0 as there are no numbers to sum.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Negative numbers are not positive integers, so the function should return 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is less than or equal to 0.\n        if n <= 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the implementation of the function using the arithmetic series formula:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_to_n(n: int):\n        if n <= 0:\n            return 0\n        return (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    ```\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the summation.\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.\n    Examples:\n        >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)\n        1\n    '''\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 294, "repair_prompt": ["def sum_to_n(n: int):\t\n'''sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n>>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    '''", " def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    '''sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, inclusive.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)\n", " def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    '''sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n        465\n        >>> sum_to_n(100)\n        5050\n        >>> sum_to_n(5)\n        15\n        >>> sum_to_n(10)\n        55\n        >>> sum_to_n(1)\n        1\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 234}
