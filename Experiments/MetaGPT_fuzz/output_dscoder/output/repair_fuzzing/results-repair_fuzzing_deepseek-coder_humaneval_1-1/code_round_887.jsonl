This means that 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int`, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters from the string.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    count_distinct_characters('aA') = 1\n    Explanation: The string 'aA' contains only one distinct character 'a' (or 'A'), even though there are two characters in total.\n    count_distinct_characters('Python') = 5\n    Explanation: The string 'Python' contains five distinct characters: 'P', 'y', 't', 'h', and 'o'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles empty strings by returning 0, and the set will naturally handle the case of no distinct characters by returning an empty set.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of distinct characters in a given string while ignoring case.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string to count distinct characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity\n    lower_string = string.lower()\n    \n    # Create a set to store unique characters\n    unique_characters = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in lower_string:\n        unique_characters.add(char)\n    \n    # Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters\n    return len(unique_characters)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(count_distinct_characters('Python'))  # Output: 5\n# print(count_distinct_characters('aA'))      # Output: 1\n# print(count_distinct_characters(''))        # Output: 0\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 887, "repair_prompt": ["def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\t\n'''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n>>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    '''", " def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\t\n    '''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n        3\n        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n        4\n        '''\n    unique_chars = set()\n    for char in string:\n        unique_chars.add(char.lower())\n    return len(unique_chars)", " def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    '''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n        3\n        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n        4\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 496}
