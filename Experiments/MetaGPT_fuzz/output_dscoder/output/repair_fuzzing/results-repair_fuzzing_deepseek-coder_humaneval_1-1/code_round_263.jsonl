The function should handle large values of n and p, which requires an optimized approach to avoid performance issues. The solution should be accurate and clear, ensuring it works correctly for various inputs including edge cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to handle large values of n and p efficiently\n- Ensure the function returns accurate results for all inputs\n- Maintain code readability and clarity for easy understanding and maintenance\n- Include detailed documentation and examples for user guidance\nTo efficiently calculate 2^n modulo p for large values of n and p, we will utilize Python's built-in pow function which is optimized for large number handling. This function can compute modular exponentiation directly, which is crucial for handling large values efficiently. We will ensure that the function is clear and readable, making it easy to understand and maintain.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'modular exponentiation': This is the process of calculating \\(2^n \\mod p\\) efficiently, especially for large values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\).\n    Explanation: Modular exponentiation is used to compute \\(2^n\\) modulo \\(p\\) without having to compute the potentially enormous number \\(2^n\\) itself. This is crucial for handling large values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) efficiently.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently calculate \\(2^n \\mod p\\), we can use Python's built-in `pow` function, which is optimized for large number handling. The `pow` function can take three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. This allows us to compute \\(2^n \\mod p\\) directly, which is more efficient than computing \\(2^n\\) and then taking the modulo.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1000, 1001) = 2\n    Explanation: For large values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\), the `pow` function efficiently computes \\(2^{1000} \\mod 1001\\) without directly computing \\(2^{1000}\\), which would be infeasible for large numbers. The result is 2, demonstrating the function's ability to handle large values efficiently.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The `pow` function in Python is designed to handle large values of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) efficiently, and it will return the correct result for large inputs.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n, p)`, we can use the following Python code:\n    ```python\n    def modp(n, p):\n        return pow(2, n, p)\n    ```\n    This code uses the `pow` function with three arguments: the base (2), the exponent (n), and the modulus (p).
