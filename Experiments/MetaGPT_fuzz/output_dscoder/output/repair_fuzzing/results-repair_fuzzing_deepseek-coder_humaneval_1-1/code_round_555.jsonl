This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strong standard library support.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distinct characters': means unique characters in a string, regardless of their case.\n    'case-insensitivity': means that the comparison should not be affected by the case of the letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters from the string.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    count_distinct_characters('aA') = 1\n    Explanation: The string 'aA' consists of two characters 'a' and 'A', which are the same when case is ignored. Thus, there is only one distinct character.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already correctly handles an empty string by returning 0.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    '''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of.
