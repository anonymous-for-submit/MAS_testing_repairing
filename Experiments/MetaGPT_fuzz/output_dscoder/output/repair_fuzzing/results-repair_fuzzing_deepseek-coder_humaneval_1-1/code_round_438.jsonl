The function should handle both odd and even length lists, returning an integer for odd lists and a float for even lists. The current implementation has a missing return statement in the else block, which needs to be corrected.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the median function to correctly calculate the median for both odd and even length lists.\n- Ensure the function is efficient and can handle large datasets.\n- Correct the implementation to return a float for even length lists.\n- Enhance the code readability and maintainability.\nTo implement the median function efficiently and correctly, we will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities. This approach ensures that the function handles large datasets effectively. We will also ensure that the function returns a float for even length lists, as specified in the requirements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'median': the middle value in a list of numbers; if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one; if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a clear approach to finding the median:\n    1.

The function should be efficient and handle different types of input lists. It should be easy to understand and use, suitable for both users and developers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the median of a list\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with one element\n- The function should be optimized for performance\n- The function should be well-documented and easy to understand\n- The function should be tested for various input scenarios\nTo create an efficient and accurate median calculation function in Python, we will utilize the statistics module, which is part of the Python Standard Library. This module provides a median function that is both performant and handles edge cases effectively. We will ensure the function is well-documented and easy to understand, aligning with the user stories and requirement analysis.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'median': The middle value of a list when it is sorted. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n    Explanation: The median is a statistical measure that divides a dataset into two equal halves, with half of the values above and half below.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the median, we need to follow these steps:\n    1.

If even, return the average of the two middle elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    median([1, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: The list is [1, 3, 3]. After sorting, it remains [1, 3, 3]. The middle element is the median.\n    median([1, 2]) = 1.5\n    Explanation: The list is [1, 2]. After sorting, it becomes [1, 2]. The two middle elements are 1 and 2, so the median is their average (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5.\n    median([7, 3, 1, 4]) = 4\n    Explanation: The list is [7, 3, 1, 4]. After sorting, it becomes [1, 3, 4, 7].
