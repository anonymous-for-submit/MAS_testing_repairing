The function will iterate through the input string and use a counter to keep track of the balance of brackets. Each time an opening bracket '(' is encountered, the counter will be incremented, and each time a closing bracket ')' is encountered, the counter will be decremented. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones, and the function will return False. If the counter is zero at the end of the iteration, the function will return True, indicating that all brackets are correctly paired.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'bracket balancing'\n    In the requirement, it means ensuring that every opening bracket \"(\" has a corresponding closing bracket \")\".\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the input string and using a counter to track the balance of brackets.
