We can set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the analysis for the third example, assuming the plan is provided:\n\n## Prompt 3:\n\n[requirement]\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet should be rotated so that the letters move down by two multiplied by two positions.\n    For example:\n        encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'\n        encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'\n        encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'\n        encrypt('et') returns 'ix'\n    '''\n    def rotate_char(c, n):\n        if 'a' <= c <= 'z':\n```\n\n[plan]\nWe will implement the encryption function using a simple approach that involves creating a rotation based on the user's input. The rotation will be calculated by multiplying the shift value by 2. This approach will ensure that the function is efficient and easy to understand.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'rotation': involves shifting the characters in the string by a certain number of positions.\n    Explanation: In this case, the rotation is by 4 positions (2 * 2) for each character in the string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrases showing quantity relationships.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No specific degree adverbs.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests creating a function `rotate_char` that takes a character and a shift value, and returns the rotated character. The main function `encrypt` will use this helper function to rotate each character in the input string by 4 positions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    edge_case1 = encrypt('a')\n    expected_output: 'c'\n    Explanation: Since 'a' is shifted by 4 positions, it becomes 'c'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge case since the rotation logic is straightforward and does not require special handling for single characters.\n\nPlease provide the plan for the third example if you want a detailed analysis for that as well.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify the need for an encryption function that rotates the alphabet by a specific number of positions. This function should be able to handle any given string and return the encrypted version based on the rotation rule. The rotation is calculated by multiplying the number 2 by 2, resulting in a shift of 4 positions.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named 'encrypt' that takes a string 's' as an argument.\n- The function should return a new string that is the result of rotating the alphabet by 4 positions.\n- Ensure the function works correctly for various input strings, including those with uppercase letters and special characters.\n- Implement error handling to manage cases where the input is not a string.\nWe will implement the 'encrypt' function by creating a new string that shifts each letter in the input string by 4 positions in the alphabet.
