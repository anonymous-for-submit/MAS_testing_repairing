The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1). For each term in the polynomial, we multiply the coefficient by the exponent and reduce the exponent by 1. We then construct a new list of coefficients for the derivative polynomial.\n\n# [edge case] \n    derivative([0, 1, 2, 3]) = [1, 4, 9]\n    Explanation: The polynomial is x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. The derivative is 3x^2 + 4x + 3. The resulting list of coefficients is [1, 4, 9].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

If not, it constructs the derivative list by multiplying each coefficient by its index (starting from 1) and returns the result.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify the need to create a function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients.
