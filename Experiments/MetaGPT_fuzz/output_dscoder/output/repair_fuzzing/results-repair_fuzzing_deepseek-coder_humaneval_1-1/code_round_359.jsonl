{"task_id": "HumanEval/144", "prompt": "def simplify(x, n):\t\n'''Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False otherwise. Both x and n are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format, <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers. You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\nsimplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") = True\n    simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") = False\n    simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") =
