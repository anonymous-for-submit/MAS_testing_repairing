The function will first check if the list is a palindrome and then sum its elements to compare with the given weight limit. This approach ensures efficiency and minimal performance impact, making it suitable for handling large lists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindromic list': A list that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it means that the list should be the same if reversed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the sum of the list elements should be greater than the given weight limit.\n    Explanation: In the example, '3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight', it means the sum of the elements is greater than the weight limit.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'less than or equal': means that the sum of the list elements should be less than or equal to the given weight limit.\n    Explanation: In the example, '3+2+3 is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight', it means the sum of the elements is within the weight limit.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function 'will_it_fly' should check if the list is a palindrome and then check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given weight limit.\n\n# [edge case] \n    will_it_fly([], 5) = False\n    Explanation: An empty list cannot fly, regardless of the weight limit.\n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 10) = True\n    Explanation: The list is a palindrome and the sum of its elements (1+2+3+2+1=9) is less than the weight limit.\n    will_it_fly([4, 3, 2, 1], 1) = False\n    Explanation: The list is not a palindrome, and the sum of its elements (4+3+2+1=10) is more than the weight limit.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic can handle cases where the list is empty or where the sum of elements is exactly equal to the weight limit.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 103], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: List[int], w: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the list is a palindrome\n    is_palindrome = (q == q[::-1])\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the list elements\n    total_weight = sum(q)\n    \n    # Check if the sum of the list elements is less than or equal to the given weight limit\n    return is_palindrome and total_weight <= w\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 262, "repair_prompt": ["def will_it_fly(q,w):\t\n'''    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n    Ensure your solution is efficient and can handle large lists with minimal performance impact.\nExample:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \u279e False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) \u279e False\n    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) \u279e True\n    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3], 5) \u279e True\n    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n    '''", " def will_it_fly(q,w):\t\n    '''    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n    Ensure your solution is efficient and can handle large lists with minimal performance impact.\nExample:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \u279e False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight,", " def will_it_fly(q,w):\n    '''    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n    Ensure your solution is efficient and can handle large lists with minimal performance impact.\nExample:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \u279e False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but"], "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 250}
