The challenge lies in computing this sequence efficiently without recursion, which can lead to exponential time complexity. The function should handle large values of n efficiently, making it suitable for both educational and practical applications.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the Fib4 sequence algorithm iteratively\n- Optimize the function for large values of n\n- Develop a user interface for easy interaction\n- Include documentation and examples for educational purposes\n- Test the function for accuracy and performance\nTo implement the Fib4 sequence efficiently without recursion, we will use an iterative approach. This method will avoid the exponential time complexity associated with recursion and will be optimized for large values of n. We will use a list to store the sequence values as we compute them, ensuring that each value is calculated only once. This approach will also allow us to handle large values of n efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Fib4 sequence': This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but includes four initial values and a different recurrence relation.\n    Explanation: The Fib4 sequence starts with fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, fib4(3) = 0, and for n >= 4, fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

We will initialize a list to store the sequence values and compute each value based on the previous four values. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    1. Initialize a list `fib4_sequence` with the first four values: `[0, 0, 2, 0]`.\n    2. Use a loop to compute each subsequent value up to `n`:\n        - For each index `i` from 4 to `n`, compute `fib4_sequence[i]` as the sum of the previous four values: `fib4_sequence[i] = fib4_sequence[i-1] + fib4_sequence[i-2] + fib4_sequence[i-3] + fib4_sequence[i-4]`.\n    3.
