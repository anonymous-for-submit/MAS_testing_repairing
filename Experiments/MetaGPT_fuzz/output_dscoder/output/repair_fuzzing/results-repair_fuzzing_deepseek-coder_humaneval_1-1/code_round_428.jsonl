The logic provided in the plan can handle zero, negative numbers, and positive numbers without additional modifications.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. The function should handle both positive and negative integers. The solution should be efficient and clear. The output should be a tuple with two elements representing the count of even and odd digits respectively.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to accurately count even and odd digits.\n- Ensure the function works for both positive and negative integers.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large numbers efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly output format, returning a tuple with counts of even and odd digits.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\nTo implement the function `even_odd_count(num)` efficiently and accurately, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and standard libraries. The function will convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit, checking if it's even or odd. This approach ensures clarity and simplicity in handling both positive and negative integers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even' and 'odd': These are key concepts referring to the parity of digits. Even numbers are divisible by 2, while odd numbers are not.\n    Explanation: The function needs to count the number of even and odd digits in the given integer, considering both positive and negative numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to follow:\n    1. Convert the integer to a string to iterate through each digit.\n    2. Initialize counters for even and odd digits.\n    3. Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the number.\n    4. Check if the digit is even or odd and update the respective counter.\n    5. Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n# [edge case] \n    even_odd_count(0) = (1, 0)\n    Explanation: The number 0 has one even digit (0) and no odd digits.\n    even_odd_count(-123) = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: The number -123 has one even digit (2) and two odd digits (1 and 3).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers zero and negative numbers correctly.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'parity': This concept refers to whether a number is even or odd.\n    Explanation: The function needs to determine the parity of each digit in the given integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find numbers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase indicates that we need to find numbers that appear a minimum number of times.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest number that meets certain criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the criteria.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'digit': These are the individual symbols used to represent numbers in base-10.\n    Explanation: The function needs to count the number of even and odd digits in the given integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to follow:\n    1.
