The function will take three parameters: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed to complete meals, and the number of remaining carrots. The function will calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after meals. If the remaining carrots are less than the need, the function will eat all remaining carrots.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrot consumption': the act of eating carrots to fulfill a need\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is about managing the consumption of carrots based on the amount already eaten and the amount needed to meet a requirement.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests a straightforward approach to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after meals. If the remaining carrots are less than the need, the function will eat all remaining carrots.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 3) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 5 carrots and needs 6 more. There are only 3 remaining carrots. The function will eat all 3 remaining carrots, making the total eaten 8, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(3, 5, 2) = [5, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 3 carrots and needs 5 more. There are only 2 remaining carrots. The function will eat all 2 remaining carrots, making the total eaten 5, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(7, 10, 5) = [12, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 7 carrots and needs 10 more. There are only 5 remaining carrots. The function will eat all 5 remaining carrots, making the total eaten 12, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already ensures that if the remaining carrots are less than the need, the function will eat all remaining carrots.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that simulates the eating behavior of a hungry rabbit. The function should take into account the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed, and the number of remaining carrots. The function should return an array with the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately simulate rabbit eating behavior.\n- The function should handle edge cases where there are not enough carrots.\n- Ensure the UI is simple and intuitive for the user.\n- Implement a clear and concise return format for the function.\n- Optimize the algorithm for efficient carrot consumption.\nTo implement the function that simulates the eating behavior of a hungry rabbit, we will use Python, leveraging its simplicity and the availability of robust standard libraries. The function will take into account the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed, and the number of remaining carrots, and return an array with the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating. We will ensure the function handles edge cases where there are not enough carrots by allowing the rabbit to eat all remaining carrots if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'hungry rabbit': means a creature that eats carrots to meet its needs\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already eaten\n    'at least as many times': means that the rabbit needs to eat a number of carrots that is at least equal to the number of carrots it has eaten\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': means that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already eaten\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should first calculate the total number of carrots the rabbit will eat, which is the sum of the number already eaten and the number needed. If the remaining carrots are less than the total needed, the rabbit will eat all remaining carrots. The function should then return an array with the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(5, 6, 10) = [11, 4]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 5 carrots, needs 6 more, and has 10 remaining. The total carrots eaten will be 5 (already eaten) + 6 (needed) = 11. After eating, 10 (remaining) - 6 (needed) = 4 carrots will be left.\n    eat(4, 8, 9) = [12, 1]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 4 carrots, needs 8 more, and has 9 remaining. The total carrots eaten will be 4 (already eaten) + 8 (needed) = 12. After eating, 9 (remaining) - 8 (needed) = 1 carrot will be left.\n    eat(1, 10, 10) = [11, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 1 carrot, needs 10 more, and has 10 remaining. The total carrots eaten will be 1 (already eaten) + 10 (needed) = 11. After eating, 10 (remaining) - 10 (needed) = 0 carrots will be left.\n    eat(2, 11, 5) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 2 carrots, needs 11 more, and has 5 remaining. The total carrots eaten will be 2 (already eaten) + 11 (needed) = 13, but since there are only 5 remaining, the rabbit will eat all 5. After eating, 5 (remaining) - 5 (needed) = 0 carrots will be left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
