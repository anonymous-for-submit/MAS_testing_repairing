The function will take an integer `n` as input and return a string of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence': means a list of numbers in order from 0 to n.\n    'string': means the output should be a string format.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `string_sequence` function, we can use a for loop to iterate from 0 to n, convert each number to a string, and concatenate them with spaces in between.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    explanation: When n is 0, the output should be '0' as there is only one number in the sequence.\n    string_sequence(1) = '0 1'\n    explanation: When n is 1, the output should be '0 1' as it includes numbers from 0 to 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic is sufficient for the edge case where n is 0.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements are clear and concise, asking for a function that generates a string of numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces. The function should also include doctests to demonstrate its functionality.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly generate the string sequence as per the requirements.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as n=0 and n=5.\n- Implement the function in Python, ensuring it is efficient and easy to understand.\n- Include comprehensive testing to cover all possible inputs and edge cases.\n- Enhance the user interface to meet the user stories and competitive analysis.\nWe will implement the function using Python's built-in capabilities. The function will generate a string of numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces. This approach is simple and leverages Python's standard library, ensuring efficiency and ease of understanding.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence': means a list of numbers in order\n    'string': means the output should be a string format\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will use a loop to generate numbers from 0 to n, then join them with spaces to form the final string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    explanation: When n is 0, the output should be a string containing only '0'.\n    string_sequence(-1) = ''\n    explanation: When n is negative, the function should return an empty string since it doesn't make sense to include negative numbers in the sequence.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is negative.\n        if n < 0:\n            return ''\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a string of numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string of numbers from 0 to n separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return ''\n    \n    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    return ' '.join(numbers)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 628, "repair_prompt": ["def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string with numbers separated by spaces beginning from 0 up to and including n.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string with numbers separated by spaces beginning from 0 up to and including n.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''\n\n    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    return ' '.join(numbers)", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    '''Return a string with numbers separated by spaces beginning from 0 up to and including n.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 130}
