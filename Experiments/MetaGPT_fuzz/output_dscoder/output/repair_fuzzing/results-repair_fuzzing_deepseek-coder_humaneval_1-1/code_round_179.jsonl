This involves converting the string to lowercase and then using a set to find unique characters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distinct characters': means unique characters in a string, regardless of their case.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to count the number of unique characters in a string, considering both uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters from the string.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    count_distinct_characters('aA') = 1\n    Explanation: The string consists of only one distinct character 'a' (or 'A'), so the function should return 1.\n    count_distinct_characters('Python') = 5\n    Explanation: The string 'Python' consists of 5 distinct characters: 'P', 'y', 't', 'h', and 'o'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the logic provided in the plan already covers them. The function will return 0 for an empty string and correctly count distinct characters for non-empty strings.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string to count distinct characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not string:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity\n    string = string.lower()\n    \n    # Create a set to store unique characters\n    unique_characters = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string and add it to the set\n    for char in string:\n        unique_characters.add(char)\n    \n    # Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters\n    return len(unique_characters)\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 179, "repair_prompt": ["def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\t\n'''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n>>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    '''", " def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\t\n'''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n>>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    '''\n    # Randomly chosen sentence to expand:\n    # The function should ignore case sensitivity and count each distinct character only once.\n    # For example, the string 'xyzXYZ' should return 3 because the characters 'x', 'y', and 'z' are distinct.\n   ", " def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    '''Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n        3\n        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n        4\n        '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 14}
