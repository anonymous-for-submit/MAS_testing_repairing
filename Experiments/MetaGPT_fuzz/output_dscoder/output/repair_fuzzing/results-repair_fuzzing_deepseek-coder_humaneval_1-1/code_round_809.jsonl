The function should handle valid fractions without zero as the denominator. The product goals include accuracy, robustness, and ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- The function should correctly multiply two fractions and check if the result is a whole number.\n- The function should handle all valid inputs including different denominators.\n- The function should be easy to understand and use.\n- The function should be optimized for performance.\nTo create a function that simplifies the expression of two fractions, we will follow these steps: 1. Parse the input strings to extract the numerators and denominators. 2. Convert the fractions to a common denominator. 3. Multiply the numerators. 4. Check if the product is a whole number. 5. Return True if the product is a whole number, otherwise return False.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'fraction': means a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, with the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number) being positive whole numbers and the denominator not being zero.\n    'simplify': means to reduce a fraction to its smallest possible form, where the numerator and denominator are as small as possible while still representing the same value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    simplify(\"1/1\", \"1/1\") = True\n    Explanation: The product of the fractions \"1/1\" * \"1/1\" is \"1/1\", which is a whole number.\n    simplify(\"2/3\", \"3/2\") = True\n    Explanation: The product of the fractions \"2/3\" * \"3/2\" is \"6/6\", which simplifies to \"1/1\", a whole number.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
