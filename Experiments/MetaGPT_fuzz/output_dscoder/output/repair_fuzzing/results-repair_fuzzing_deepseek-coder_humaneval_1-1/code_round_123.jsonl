If no letters are found, we will reverse the string. For letters, we will toggle their case. This approach ensures that the function handles both small and large strings effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'string manipulation': involves changing the case of characters or reversing the string based on the presence of letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Check if the string contains any letters.\n    - If it does, iterate through the string and toggle the case of each letter.\n    - If it does not, reverse the string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    solve('123') = '321'\n    explanation: The string contains no letters, so the function should reverse the string.\n    solve('aBc') = 'AbC'\n    explanation: The string contains letters, so the function should toggle the case of each letter.\n    solve('!@#') = '!@#'\n    explanation: The string contains no letters, so the function should reverse the string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
