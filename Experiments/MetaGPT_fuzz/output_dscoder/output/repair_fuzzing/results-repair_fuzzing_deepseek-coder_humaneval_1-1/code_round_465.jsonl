The algorithm will compare elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center, counting the number of mismatches. Each mismatch will require a change. We will ensure the solution handles edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays with a single element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindromic array': an array that reads the same forwards and backwards\n    'minimum number of changes': the smallest number of modifications needed to make the array palindromic\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Compare elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center.\n    - Count the number of mismatches.\n    - Each mismatch requires a change.\n    - Handle edge cases:\n        - Empty array: return 0 since a palindrome is trivially true.\n        - Single-element array: return 0 since a single element is already a palindrome.\n\n# [edge case] \n    smallest_change([]) = 0\n    explanation: An empty array is already a palindrome, so no changes are needed.\n    smallest_change([5]) = 0\n    explanation: A single-element array is already a palindrome, so no changes are needed.\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 4\n    explanation: The array is not a palindrome, and the minimum number of changes required to make it palindromic is 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

This involves comparing elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center, and changing elements as necessary to match the opposite side. Edge cases to consider include empty arrays and arrays with a single element.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function that can handle arrays of any size.\n- Ensure the function can handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays with a single element.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large arrays efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise documentation for the function.\nTo implement the function `smallest_change` that finds the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic, we will use a straightforward approach. We will compare elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center, and change elements as necessary to match the opposite side. This method will ensure that we efficiently determine the minimum number of changes required. We will also handle edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays with a single element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindromic array': an array that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n    Explanation: In this context, a palindromic array means that for any given array, if we reverse the order of its elements, the resulting array should be identical to the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `smallest_change`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the array is empty or has only one element. If so, return 0 since no changes are needed.\n    2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of changes.\n    3. Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the array and the other at the end.\n    4. Compare the elements at these two pointers.\n    5. If they are not equal, increment the counter.\n    6. Move the pointers towards the center.\n    7. Continue until the pointers meet in the middle.\n    8.
