ASCII values for uppercase characters in a given string. The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without uppercase characters. The product goals include creating an efficient function, ensuring ease of use, and optimizing performance for large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the sum of ASCII values for uppercase characters.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings without uppercase characters.\n- Ensure the function is easy to understand and maintain.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\nWe will use Python's built-in functions and a simple loop to iterate through each character in the input string, checking if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, we will sum up its ASCII value. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strong standard library.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'ASCII values': The core concept here is the use of ASCII values to represent characters in a string. Each uppercase letter has a unique ASCII value, and we need to sum these values for all uppercase characters in the string.\n    Explanation: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique number to each character used in digital communication, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and other symbols.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan provided outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem.

The function should handle empty strings, strings with both uppercase and lowercase characters, and strings with only uppercase characters. The examples provided give clear guidance on the expected output for various inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should define a function named digitSum that takes a single string parameter.\n- The function should iterate through each character in the string, check if it is an uppercase letter, and if so, add its ASCII value to a running total.\n- The function should return the total sum of ASCII values for all uppercase characters in the string.\n- Implement error handling to manage non-string inputs gracefully.\n- Include a simple test suite to verify the correctness of the digitSum function.\nWe will implement the function digitSum by iterating through each character in the input string, checking if it is an uppercase letter, and if so, adding its ASCII value to a running total.
