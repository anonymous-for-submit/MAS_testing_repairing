The requirements are clear and straightforward, focusing on functionality and efficiency.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to find the biggest even number in a given range\n- Ensure the application handles large ranges efficiently\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy input and output\n- Design a clean and visually appealing interface\n- Test the application for accuracy and performance\nTo implement the function that finds the biggest even number within a given range, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage a simple and efficient approach. The function will iterate through the range from x to y, check for even numbers, and keep track of the largest one found. If no even number is found, the function will return -1.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'even number': means a number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the largest integer within a given range that is even.

The logic in the plan already covers the edge case where x is greater than y by ensuring no numbers are considered in such a scenario.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to find the biggest even integer within a given range [x, y].
