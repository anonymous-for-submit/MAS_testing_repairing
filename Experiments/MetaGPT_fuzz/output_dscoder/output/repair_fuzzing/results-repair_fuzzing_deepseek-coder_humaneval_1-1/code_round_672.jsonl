This will involve using a set to store unique characters, which allows for efficient checking and counting of distinct elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distinct characters': means unique characters that appear in the string, regardless of their case.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to count the number of unique characters in a string, considering both uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n    2. Use a set to store unique characters from the string.\n    3. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_distinct_characters('') = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so the number of distinct characters is 0.\n    count_distinct_characters('aA') = 1\n    Explanation: The string consists of only one distinct character 'a' (or 'A'), so the function should return 1.\n    count_distinct_characters('Python') = 5\n    Explanation: The string 'Python' consists of 5 distinct characters: 'P', 'y', 't', 'h', and 'o'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan already covers all cases, including an empty string.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129, 129], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    '''Given a string, determine how many distinct characters the string consists of.
