Therefore, we only need to check if n is at least 20 and divisible by 4. This can be efficiently implemented in Python.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of four positive even integers'\n    This means the total is the result of adding four even numbers together. Even numbers are numbers that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)`, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Check if `n` is at least 20.\n    2. Check if `n` is divisible by 4.\n    3. If both conditions are met, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_equal_to_sum_even(3) = False\n    Explanation: The number 3 cannot be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers because the smallest sum of four positive even integers is 20.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(2) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the case above, 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(22) = True\n    Explanation: The number 22 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even integers: 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 = 22.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases because the logic provided in the plan is sufficient to check if `n` is at least 20 and divisible by 4.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.7165, 0.7244, 0.7165, 0.9843, 0.7165, 0.5984, 1.0, 0.5433, 0.7008], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [127, 91, 92, 91, 125, 91, 76, 127, 69, 89], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a given number n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if n is at least 20 and divisible by 4\n    if n >= 20 and n % 4 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 474, "repair_prompt": ["def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\t\n'''Evaluate whether the given number n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\nExample\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    '''", " def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\t\n    '''Evaluate whether the given number n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\n    Example\n        is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n        is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n        is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    '''\n\n    # Mutated sentence: Determine if the number n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\n    # Mutated sentence: Check if the given", " def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    '''Evaluate whether the given number n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.\nExample\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 358}
