The function needs to handle the planets correctly and return them in the correct order based on their positions in the solar system.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function should first validate the input planet names to ensure they are part of the known planets. If valid, find their indices in the list of planets. Then, determine the range between these indices, considering the order of the planets. Finally, return the sorted list of planets within this range.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf('Mars', 'Earth') = ('Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')\n    Explanation: Mars is the 4th planet and Earth is the 3rd, so the function should return all planets between Mars and Earth, inclusive, in the correct order.\n    bf('Earth', 'Mars') = ('Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')\n    Explanation: The order is reversed, but the function should still return the correct range of planets.\n    bf('Pluto', 'Earth') = ()\n    Explanation: Pluto is not a planet, so the function should return an empty tuple.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the case where one or both planet names are not valid. This can be done by checking if the planet names are in the list of known planets before proceeding with the main logic.\n    def bf(planet1, planet2):\n        planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']\n        if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n            return ()\n        # Rest of the logic for finding the planets between planet1 and planet2\n\n    This additional check ensures that the function does not attempt to find planets between non-existent entries in the list.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.5392, 1.0, 0.598, 0.5392, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 55, 102, 61, 55, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef bf(planet1: str, planet2: str) -> tuple:\n    planets = ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')\n    \n    # Validate the input planets\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    # Find the indices of the planets\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    # Ensure index1 is less than index2 for easier slicing\n    if index1 > index2:\n        index1, index2 = index2, index1\n    \n    # Return the slice of planets between the two indices\n    return tuple(planets[index1 + 1:index2])\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 665, "repair_prompt": ["def bf(planet1, planet2):\t\n'''There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
