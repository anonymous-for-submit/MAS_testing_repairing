Therefore, the rabbit will eat all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 7 eaten and 0 remaining.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan can handle this scenario by ensuring the rabbit eats all available carrots when the need exceeds the remaining stock.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after meals. The function should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need. The constraints ensure that the inputs are within a reasonable range. The product should provide a fun and engaging experience while being visually appealing and easy to use.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots.\n- The application should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need.\n- The user interface should be visually appealing and easy to navigate.\n- The application should be responsive and work well on both mobile and desktop devices.\n- The game should offer a fun and engaging experience for the user.\nWe will implement the function `eat` in Python, ensuring it meets the requirements specified. The function will calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after meals, handling cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need. We will use basic Python constructs and ensure the function is simple and easy to understand.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the act of eating a certain number of carrots to fulfill a need.\n    Explanation: In this context, the core concept revolves around the act of eating a specific number of carrots to satisfy a daily requirement, considering the available stock.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the number of carrots needed exceeds the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the total number of carrots to be eaten (including the already eaten amount) must be greater than the number of carrots already consumed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': indicates a comparison where the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: This degree adverb emphasizes the requirement to eat more carrots than what has already been consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should consider the total number of carrots to be eaten (already eaten + needed) and compare it with the remaining carrots. If the total exceeds the remaining, the rabbit will eat all available carrots and still be hungry.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(2, 11, 5) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 2 carrots, needs 11 more, and there are 5 remaining. The rabbit will eat all 5 remaining carrots, totaling 7 eaten, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(1, 10, 10) = [11, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 1 carrot, needs 10 more, and there are 10 remaining. The rabbit will eat all 10 remaining carrots, totaling 11 eaten, and there will be 0 carrots left.\n    eat(4, 8, 9) = [12, 1]\n    Explanation: The rabbit has eaten 4 carrots, needs 8 more, and there are 9 remaining. The rabbit will eat 8 more carrots, totaling 12 eaten, and there will be 1 carrot left.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic in the function already accounts for the scenario where the rabbit eats all available remaining carrots and still needs more.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount after meals. The function should handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, in which case all remaining carrots are eaten. Clarifications are needed on the exact behavior when the need exceeds the remaining carrots and the expected output format.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the eat function to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount.\n- Ensure the application is user-friendly and provides clear feedback on the number of carrots eaten and remaining.\n- Develop a lightweight application that does not consume excessive resources.\nTo implement the 'eat' function, we will use a straightforward approach that calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount based on the inputs. We will ensure the application is lightweight and efficient, adhering to the user stories and competitive analysis provided.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'carrots consumption': the process of eating a certain number of carrots to meet a daily requirement.\n    Explanation: The function `eat` deals with the number of carrots a rabbit consumes to meet its daily meal requirements. It returns an array containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after meals.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than it has already consumed.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" indicates that the number of carrots needed (`need`) is greater than the number of carrots already eaten (`number`).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more': indicates a comparison where the number of carrots needed is greater than the number already eaten.\n    Explanation: The adverb \"more\" implies that the required number of carrots is strictly greater than the number already consumed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The logic should consider the following steps:\n    1. Calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number already eaten to the number needed.\n    2. Calculate the remaining number of carrots by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining carrots available.\n    3. Ensure that if the remaining carrots are less than the number needed, the rabbit eats all available remaining carrots.\n\n# [edge case] \n    eat(4, 8, 3) = [7, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit needs 8 more carrots than it has (4 already eaten), but there are only 3 remaining. Therefore, the rabbit eats all 3 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 7 carrots eaten and 0 remaining.\n    eat(5, 6, 2) = [6, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit needs 6 more carrots than it has (5 already eaten), but there are only 2 remaining. Therefore, the rabbit eats all 2 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 6 carrots eaten and 0 remaining.\n    eat(3, 10, 5) = [8, 0]\n    Explanation: The rabbit needs 10 more carrots than it has (3 already eaten), but there are only 5 remaining. Therefore, the rabbit eats all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 8 carrots eaten and 0 remaining.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
