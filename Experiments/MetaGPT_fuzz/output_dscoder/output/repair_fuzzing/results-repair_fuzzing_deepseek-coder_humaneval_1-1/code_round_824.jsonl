{"task_id": "HumanEval/41", "prompt": "def car_race_collision(n: int):\t\n'''Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. These two sets of cars are initially very far apart from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong. As a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nThis function outputs the number of such collisions.\n'''", "entry_point": "car_race_collision",

We will use a simple grid-based approach to represent the road and cars, ensuring that the cars move at a constant speed and detect collisions when they meet on the grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'car race collision': This refers to the scenario where two sets of cars moving in opposite directions do not actually collide but continue moving as if nothing happened.
