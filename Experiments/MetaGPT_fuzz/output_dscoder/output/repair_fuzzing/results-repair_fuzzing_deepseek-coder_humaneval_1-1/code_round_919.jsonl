The function will use a predefined list of planets sorted by their distance from the sun. It will validate the input planet names and return a sorted list of planets between the given two planets, or an empty list if the input is incorrect.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planets': means celestial bodies that orbit around a star, specifically in the context of our solar system.\n    'proximity to the sun': refers to the order of planets from the closest to the farthest from the Sun.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    bf(\"Jupiter\", \"Ne\") = ()\n    Explanation: The input \"Ne\" is not a valid planet name.

This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency. We will validate the input planet names against a list of known planets and then find and sort the planets between the two given planets based on their position in the solar system.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'planets': means celestial bodies that orbit around a star, specifically in the context of our solar system.\n    Explanation: The requirement is focused on identifying and manipulating data related to planets in the solar system.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that we need to identify and return a subset of planets based on their proximity to the sun, specifically between two given planets.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'sorted by proximity to the sun': means that the planets should be returned in an order based on their distance from the Sun.\n    Explanation: This degree adverb specifies that the order of the planets in the output should reflect their relative distance from the Sun, ensuring the correct sequence.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan involves:\n    1.
