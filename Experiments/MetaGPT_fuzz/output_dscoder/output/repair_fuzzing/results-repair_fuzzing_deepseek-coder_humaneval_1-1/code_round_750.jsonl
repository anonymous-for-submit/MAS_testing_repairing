Therefore, the expected output is an empty list.\n    get_positive([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]) = []\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, all numbers are negative, so the expected output is an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic already correctly handles lists that contain only non-positive numbers, returning an empty list as expected.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirement is to create a function that filters out positive numbers from a list. The function should be efficient and handle various edge cases. The competitive analysis shows that Python's built-in filter function and other custom list filtering functions are widely used, indicating a high demand for such functionality. Our target function should aim to be more robust and performant.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to filter positive numbers accurately\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance\n- Test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure correctness\n- Consider integrating the function into a larger project\n- Explore potential improvements for edge case handling\nTo implement the function efficiently and handle various edge cases, we will utilize Python's built-in capabilities, specifically focusing on list comprehensions and the filter function. This approach is both simple and leverages native Python features, ensuring performance and ease of use.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive integers'\n    In the requirement, it means that we are only interested in numbers that are greater than zero.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function efficiently, we can use a list comprehension to filter out the positive integers from the input list. Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    ```python\n    def get_positive(l: list):\n        return [num for num in l if num > 0]\n    ```\n\n    This code iterates through each number in the list `l` and includes it in the output list only if the number is greater than zero.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_positive([-1, -2, -3]) = []\n    Explanation: Since all numbers in the list are negative, none of them are greater than zero, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    get_positive([0, 0, 0]) = []\n    Explanation: Although the list is non-empty, all numbers are zero, which are not greater than zero. Therefore, the expected output is an empty list.\n    get_positive([-5, 4, -3, 2, -1, 1]) = [4, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: The numbers 4, 2, and 1 are the only positive integers in the list. All other numbers are negative or zero, so they are excluded from the output.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided list comprehension already correctly handles lists with all non-positive numbers or all zeros by returning an empty list.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96, 96], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef get_positive(l: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of integers and returns a list of positive integers.\n    \n    Args:\n        l (list): A list of integers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of positive integers from the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in l if num > 0]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 750, "repair_prompt": ["def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Return just the numbers above zero in the array.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 5, 6]\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    '''", " def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Return just the numbers above zero in the array.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 5, 6]\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    '''\n\n    positive", " def get_positive(l: list):\t\n'''Return just the numbers above zero in the array.\n>>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 5, 6]\n    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 487}
