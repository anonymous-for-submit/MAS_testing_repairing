Therefore, the output remains the same as the input list.\n    intersperse([], 7) = []\n    Explanation: If the input list is empty, there are no elements to insert the delimiter between. The expected output is an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers the cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to insert a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list of integers. This is a straightforward task that involves iterating through the list and inserting the delimiter at the appropriate positions. The function should handle both empty lists and lists with multiple elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as empty lists.\n- The application should be efficient and handle large lists without performance issues.\nWe will implement the function `intersperse` using a simple and efficient approach. The function will iterate through the input list and insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. To ensure efficiency, we will use list comprehension to create the new list with the inserted delimiters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'insertion': means adding a specific element (delimiter) between every two consecutive elements of a list.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to insert a given number (delimiter) between each pair of numbers in the input list. This involves iterating through the list and adding the delimiter appropriately.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a simple and efficient approach, which involves iterating through the input list and inserting the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Here's a detailed logic to implement the code:\n    1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n    2. Initialize an empty list to store the result.\n    3. Iterate through the input list, and for each element (except the last one), append the element followed by the delimiter to the result list.\n    4. Append the last element of the input list to the result list.\n    5. Return the result list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    intersperse([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) = [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]\n    Explanation: The delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the list. The expected output is a list where each pair of elements is separated by the delimiter.\n    intersperse([5], 9) = [5]\n    Explanation: Since there is only one element in the list, the delimiter does not affect the list's structure. The output remains the same as the input.\n    intersperse([], 7) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list should return an empty list regardless of the delimiter.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers the edge cases of an empty list and a list with a single element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements are clear and concise, asking for a function that inserts a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list.
