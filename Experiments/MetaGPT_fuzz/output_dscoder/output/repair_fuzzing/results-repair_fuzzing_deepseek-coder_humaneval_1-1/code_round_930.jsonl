The resulting list of coefficients is [0, 6].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic already correctly handles the case where the input list has only one element.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the derivative function:\n\n    ```python\n    def derivative(xs: list):\n        if len(xs) == 1:\n            return []\n        return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n    ```\n\n    This function first checks if the list has only one element, in which case it returns an empty list since the derivative of a constant is 0. Otherwise, it uses a list comprehension to generate the new list of coefficients by applying the power rule to each term, starting from the second term (index 1) to the last term.\n"], "scores": [0.0303, 1.0, 0.9899, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0303, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, false, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [3, 99, 98, 99, 0, 99, 99, 0, 3, 99], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef derivative(xs: list) -> list:\n    '''\n    Calculate the derivative of a polynomial given by its coefficients in a list.\n    Args:\n    xs (list): List of coefficients where the index represents the power of x.\n    Returns:\n    list: List of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n    '''\n    if len(xs) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Polynomial cannot be empty\")\n    if len(xs) == 1:\n        return []\n    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in xs):\n        raise ValueError(\"All coefficients must be numbers\")\n    return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 930, "repair_prompt": ["def derivative(xs: list):\t\n'''xs represent coefficients of a polynomial, given by xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
