The function should handle both small and large values of n, ensuring it performs well even for large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to accurately sum numbers from 1 to n.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance, especially for large values of n.\n- Include comprehensive documentation and examples to aid user understanding.\n- Include unit tests to verify the function's correctness.\n- Consider adding a feature to handle negative numbers if applicable.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a simple and efficient function that sums all numbers from 1 to n.
