This approach is both efficient and leverages Python's robust standard library.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(0, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(n = 0\\), \\(2^0 = 1\\). The result of \\(1 \\mod 101\\) is 1.\n    modp(100, 101) = 1\n    Explanation: When \\(n = 100\\), \\(2^{100}\\) is a very large number, but when we take it modulo 101, the result is 1. This is because \\(2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\mod 101\\) due to Fermat's Little Theorem.\n    modp(-1, 101) = 51\n    Explanation: When \\(n = -1\\), \\(2^{-1}\\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 101. Since \\(2 \\times 51 \\equiv 1 \\mod 101\\), the result is 51.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
