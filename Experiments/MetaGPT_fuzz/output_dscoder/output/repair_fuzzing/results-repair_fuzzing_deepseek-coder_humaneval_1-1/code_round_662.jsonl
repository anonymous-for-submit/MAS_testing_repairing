The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1) / 2. This can be directly implemented in Python.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_to_n(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 0 is not a natural number and does not fit the requirement of summing numbers from 1 to n, the expected output is 0.\n    sum_to_n(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Similar to the case of 0, -5 is not a natural number and does not fit the requirement. The expected output is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases since the mathematical formula already covers all cases, including non-natural numbers.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102, 102], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    '''\n    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number up to which the sum is calculated.\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.\n    '''\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 662, "repair_prompt": ["def sum_to_n(n: int):\t\n'''sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
