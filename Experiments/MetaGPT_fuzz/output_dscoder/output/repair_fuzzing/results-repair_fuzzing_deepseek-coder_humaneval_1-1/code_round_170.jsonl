The function will compare each element with the next one to determine if the list is consistently increasing or decreasing. If the list has at least two elements, the function will return True if it is monotonic, and False otherwise.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'monotonic': means the list is either always increasing or always decreasing.\n    Explanation: A list is considered monotonic if its elements are consistently non-decreasing or non-increasing. This means that for any two elements in the list, the first is either less than or equal to the second, or the first is greater than or equal to the second.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To check if a list is monotonic, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one. If we find any element that breaks the pattern of being non-decreasing or non-increasing, we can immediately return False. If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, we return True.\n\n# [edge case] \n    monotonic([1, 2]) = True\n    Explanation: With only two elements, the list is trivially monotonic as there are no other elements to compare.\n    monotonic([2, 1]) = True\n    Explanation: With only two elements, the list is also trivially monotonic in a decreasing order.\n    monotonic([1, 2, 3, 2]) = False\n    Explanation: The list is not monotonic because the element 3 is greater than the next element 2, indicating an increase followed by a decrease.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic for checking monotonicity can be applied directly to lists with fewer than two elements.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
