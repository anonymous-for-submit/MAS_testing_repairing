The requirement is clear and straightforward, focusing on the core functionality without additional complexities.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be concise and readable.\n- The function should handle edge cases like n=0 and large values of n efficiently.\n- Include basic error handling for non-integer inputs.\n- Optimize the function for performance, especially for large n.\n- Consider adding documentation and tests to ensure reliability.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a simple and efficient function that generates a string of space-delimited numbers from 0 to n. The function will utilize list comprehensions for generating the numbers and the join method for creating the final string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'space-delimited numbers'\n    In the requirement, it means that the numbers in the output string are separated by spaces.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The provided plan is already detailed and follows the core concept well. The function uses a list comprehension to generate numbers from 0 to n and then joins them with spaces to form the final string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string_sequence(0) = '0'\n    Explanation: When n is 0, the function should return a string containing only the number 0.\n    string_sequence(-1) = ''\n    Explanation: If n is negative, the function should return an empty string since it doesn't make sense to include negative numbers in the sequence.\n    string_sequence(10) = '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'\n    Explanation: When n is 10, the function should return a string containing numbers from 0 to 10, each separated by a space.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The current logic correctly handles negative inputs by returning an empty string.\n"], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a string of space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string of space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return ''\n    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(string_sequence(10))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 829, "repair_prompt": ["def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\t\n'''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n>>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''\n\n    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    return ' '.join(numbers)", " def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    '''Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 13}
