The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    Consider optimizing for time complexity while ensuring

Each array contains scores or results from matches, and the function will calculate the difference between each corresponding element in these arrays. If the guess matches the game result, the difference will be 0; otherwise, it will be the absolute difference between the two values.

The logic provided in the plan can handle cases where the arrays are of equal length.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the code:\n    1. Define the function `compare(game, guess)` that takes two lists `game` and `guess`.\n    2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the differences.\n    3. Iterate through the indices of the lists using a loop.\n    4. For each index, calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `game` and `guess`.\n    5. Append the calculated difference to the `result` list.\n    6. Return the `result` list.\n\n# [edge case]\n    compare([1,2,3], [1,2]) = [0,0]\n    Explanation: The lengths of the `game` and `guess` arrays are not equal. This is an edge case that should be handled by checking the lengths of the arrays before performing the comparison.\n    compare([], [1,2,3]) = []\n    Explanation: The `game` array is empty, and there are no elements to compare with the `guess` array. This is another edge case that should be handled by checking if either array is empty before performing the comparison.\n    compare([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) = [3,3,3]\n    Explanation: The `game` and `guess` arrays have no matching elements, so the differences are the absolute values of the differences between each element in the `game` and `guess` arrays.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify a function that compares two arrays of scores and guesses, returning an array indicating how far off each guess was.
