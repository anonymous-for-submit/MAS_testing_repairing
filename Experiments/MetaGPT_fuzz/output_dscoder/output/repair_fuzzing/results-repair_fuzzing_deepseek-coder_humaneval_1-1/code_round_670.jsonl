compute 2^n modulo p accurately. The function should handle large values of n and p without causing overflow or incorrect results. The examples provided give a range of inputs to test the function.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to handle large values of n and p without overflow.\n- Ensure the function returns accurate results for all given examples.\n- Optimize the function for performance on high-end systems.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Provide documentation and examples for easy understanding and usage.\nTo implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)` accurately and efficiently, we will leverage Python's built-in capabilities and the `math` library to handle large numbers and modulo operations. The function will use the properties of modular arithmetic to compute `2^n % p` without directly calculating `2^n` due to its potential size. This approach ensures that the function remains efficient even for large values of `n` and `p`. We will also include error handling to manage invalid inputs such as non-positive values of `p`.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'modular arithmetic': This refers to the arithmetic of congruences, where numbers \"wrap around\" upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. In this case, the operation is `2^n % p`, which calculates the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n\n    Explanation: Modular arithmetic is crucial in ensuring that the result of the operation does not exceed the modulus, preventing overflow and ensuring accurate results.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if `p` is a positive integer. If not, return an error message.\n    2. Use the built-in `pow` function in Python with the third argument to perform the modulo operation directly, which is more efficient and avoids overflow.\n\n# [edge case] \n    modp(1000, 1001) = 1\n    Explanation: Since `1001` is just one more than `1000`, `2^1000 % 1001` will be `1` because `2^1000` is a large number close to a multiple of `1001`, and the remainder when divided by `1001` is `1`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The built-in `pow` function in Python already efficiently handles large numbers and the modulo operation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's the detailed logic to implement the function:\n\n    ```python\n    def modp(n: int, p: int):\n        if p <= 0:\n            return \"Error: p must be a positive integer\"\n        return pow(2, n, p)\n    ```\n\n    This function first checks if `p` is a positive integer. If not, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it uses the `pow` function with three arguments (`base`, `exponent`, `modulus`) to compute `2^n % p` efficiently and accurately.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements specify the need for a function that computes 2^n modulo p. This is crucial for scenarios where large powers of 2 need to be evaluated modulo a given prime number to prevent overflow and ensure accuracy. The function should handle both small and large values of n efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to handle large values of n accurately.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance.\n- Include detailed documentation for developers.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for easy integration.\n- Include unit tests to verify the function's correctness.\nTo implement the function `modp(n: int, p: int)` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities for handling large integers. The function will compute `2^n` and then apply the modulo operation with `p`. Python's `int` type can handle very large numbers without overflow, which is suitable for this task.
