The solution should be optimized for both time and space complexity to ensure efficient performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the product of tuple elements.\n- Ensure the function can handle tuples with zero values.\n- Ensure the function can handle tuples with negative values.\n- Optimize the function for both time and space complexity.\n- Ensure the function is readable and maintainable.\nTo implement the function `min_product_tuple` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and avoid unnecessary complexity. The function will iterate through each tuple in the list, calculate the product of its elements, and keep track of the minimum product found. Special care will be taken to handle edge cases such as tuples containing zero or negative values.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'minimum product': the smallest product of the pairs of numbers within a tuple\n\n    'edge cases': special scenarios that require special handling, such as tuples containing zero or negative values\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize a variable to store the minimum product found so far.\n    - Iterate through each tuple in the list.\n    - Calculate the product of the elements in each tuple.\n    - Update the minimum product if the current product is smaller.\n    - Return the minimum product found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    min_product_tuple([(0, 5)]) = 0\n    Explanation: The tuple contains zero, so the product is zero, which is the smallest possible product.\n    min_product_tuple([(-3, 4)]) = -12\n    Explanation: The tuple contains a negative and a positive number. The product is negative, and since it's the only tuple, it's the minimum.\n    min_product_tuple([(2, -1), (-3, 4)]) = -12\n    Explanation: The first tuple has a positive product (2 * -1 = -2), and the second tuple has a negative product (-3 * 4 = -12). The minimum product is -12.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        - Check if any tuple contains zero and return 0 immediately if so.\n        - Ensure to handle negative values correctly to find the minimum product.\n\n    Example extra code:\n        for t in lst:\n            product = t[0] * t[1]\n            if product < min_product:\n                min_product = product\n            if product == 0:\n                return 0\n        return min_product\n"], "test": ["def check(min_product_tuple):\n\tassert min_product_tuple([(2, 7),
