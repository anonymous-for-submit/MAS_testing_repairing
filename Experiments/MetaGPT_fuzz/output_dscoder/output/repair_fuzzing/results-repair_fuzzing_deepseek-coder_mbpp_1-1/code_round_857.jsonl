The XOR operation will result in a negative number if and only if one of the operands is positive and the other is negative.\n\n    Here's the logic:\n    1. Check if the result of the XOR operation between the two integers is negative.\n    2. Return `True` if the result is negative, indicating opposite signs.\n    3. Return `False` otherwise.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 is neither positive nor negative, so the function should return False.\n    opposite_Signs(5, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous case, the number 0 is neither positive nor negative, so the function should return False.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: The numbers -1 and 1 are of opposite signs, so the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The XOR operation inherently handles the case where one or both integers are zero, as the result will not be negative in such cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function 'opposite_Signs' needs to be simple and efficient. It should take two integers as input and return True if one is positive and the other is negative, and False otherwise. This function is fundamental to the game logic and must be robust and easy to understand.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include the function 'opposite_Signs' to check the signs of two integers.\n- The game logic should utilize 'opposite_Signs' to manage game difficulty based on player's choices.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for selecting game difficulty levels.\n- Ensure the game interface is responsive and visually appealing.\n- Include a restart button in the game interface for easy access when the player loses.\nWe will implement the 'opposite_Signs' function using Python's built-in capabilities, ensuring it is simple and efficient. This function will take two integers as input and return True if one is positive and the other is negative, and False otherwise. This approach leverages Python's ability to handle bitwise operations efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'opposite signs': means that one integer is positive and the other is negative\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To check if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the XOR operator (`^`). When two numbers have opposite signs, their XOR result will have the sign bit set (i.e., the most significant bit will be 1). In Python, this can be checked using the expression `(a ^ b) < 0`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: Both numbers are not of opposite signs. 0 is considered neither positive nor negative.\n    opposite_Signs(5, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, 0 is considered neither positive nor negative.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: One number is negative (-1) and the other is positive (1), so they have opposite signs.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The XOR operation will naturally return False for the edge case where either number is zero, as the result will be -1 (which is a negative number in two's complement representation).\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that checks if two integers have opposite signs. This is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, including data validation and algorithm implementation. The function should be simple, efficient, and easy to understand. It should handle basic integer inputs and return a boolean value indicating whether the signs are opposite.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be concise and readable.\n- The function should accurately determine if two integers have opposite signs.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as zero and very large numbers.\n- The function should be optimized for performance.\n- Include comments to explain the logic for educational purposes.\nWe will use a simple and straightforward approach to implement the `opposite_Signs` function. The function will take two integers as input and return a boolean value indicating whether they have opposite signs. The implementation will leverage Python's built-in capabilities to ensure efficiency and readability.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'reverse signs': means one integer is positive and the other is negative\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function `opposite_Signs` will take two integers as input and return `True` if they have opposite signs, and `False` otherwise. This can be achieved by checking if the product of the two integers is negative. If the product is negative, the numbers have opposite signs; otherwise, they do not.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The edge case here is when one of the integers is zero. Since zero is neither positive nor negative, the function should return `False` as there cannot be opposite signs with zero.\n    opposite_Signs(5, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, the function should return `False` when one of the integers is zero.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, -2) = False\n    Explanation: Both integers are negative, so they do not have opposite signs. The function should return `False`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the logic to check for opposite signs is straightforward and does not need additional conditions for zero.\n"], "test": ["def check(opposite_Signs):\n\tassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True", "def check(opposite_Signs):\n\tassert opposite_Signs(3,2) == False", "def
