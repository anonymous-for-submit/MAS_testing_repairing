The function will first check if the inputs are tuples and raise an error if they are not. It will then compare each element of the second tuple with its corresponding element in the first tuple.

The function will also handle edge cases such as empty tuples and tuples with different data types by using type checking.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'tuple': a collection of items of any type, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.\n    'comparison': comparing elements of two tuples to check if each element in the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Define the function `check_smaller` with two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n    (2) Use a loop to iterate through both tuples simultaneously.\n    (3) For each pair of elements, check if the element from `tuple2` is smaller than the corresponding element from `tuple1`.\n    (4) If any element in `tuple2` is not smaller than its counterpart in `tuple1`, return `False`.\n    (5) If all elements in `tuple2` are smaller than their counterparts in `tuple1`, return `True`.\n    (6) Handle edge cases where tuples are empty or contain different data types by using `if` statements to check the length of the tuples and the data types of the elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    check_smaller((), (1, 2, 3)) = True\n    Explanation: Since the first tuple is empty, there are no elements to compare, so the function should return True.\n    check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)) = False\n    Explanation: All elements in the second tuple are equal to their counterparts in the first tuple, so the function should return False.\n    check_smaller((1, 2, '3'), (2, 3, 4)) = False\n    Explanation: The first tuple contains a string ('3'), which is a different data type from the integers in the tuple. This should cause the function to return False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):\n            return False\n        for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n            if not isinstance(tuple1[i], type(tuple2[i])):\n                return False\n        (other code)\n"], "test": ["def check(check_smaller):\n\tassert
