who need to handle large inputs. The function should be optimized to handle such cases without significant performance degradation. Additionally, clear documentation and user-friendly integration options are essential for developers and mathematicians who will be using this function.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be optimized for large inputs\n- Provide clear documentation for the function\n- Ensure easy integration with other software\n- Include examples and tutorials for educational purposes\n- Include additional mathematical functions for related calculations\nTo create an efficient and accurate algorithm for calculating Bell numbers, we will utilize dynamic programming techniques.
