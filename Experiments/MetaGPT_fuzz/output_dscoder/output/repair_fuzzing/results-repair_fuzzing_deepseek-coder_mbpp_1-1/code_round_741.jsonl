The function will iterate through the list, check for negative numbers, and sum them up. This approach ensures both readability and performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'negative numbers': numbers that are less than zero\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is identifying and summing up all the negative numbers in a given list.

Finally, it returns the total sum of negative numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_negativenum([1, 3, 5, 7]) = 0\n    Explanation: Since there are no negative numbers in the list, the function should return 0.\n    sum_negativenum([]) = 0\n    Explanation: An empty list should return 0 as there are no numbers to sum.\n    sum_negativenum([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) = -15\n    Explanation: All numbers in the list are negative, so the function should return their sum, which is -15.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for these edge cases as the provided logic already handles them correctly. The function will simply return 0 for an empty list or the sum of negative numbers in a list with no positive numbers.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that sums all negative numbers in a given list.
