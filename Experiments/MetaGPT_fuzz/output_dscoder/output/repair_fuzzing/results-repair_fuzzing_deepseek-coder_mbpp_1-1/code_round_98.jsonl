The function should skip the division for the second element (4 / 0) and return None for that position, while continuing with the rest of the operations.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where division by zero occurs.\n        result = []\n        for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n            if b == 0:\n                result.append(None)\n            else:\n                result.append(a / b)\n        return tuple(result)\n\n    This code snippet checks for division by zero and appends None to the result list for those positions, ensuring that the function can handle such cases gracefully.\n"], "test": ["def check(division_elements):\n\tassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)", "def
