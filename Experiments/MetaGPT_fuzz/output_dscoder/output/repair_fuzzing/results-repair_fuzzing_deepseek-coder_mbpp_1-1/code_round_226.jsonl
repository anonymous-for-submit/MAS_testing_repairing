Iterate through each number in the given range from `startnum` to `endnum`.\n    2. For each number, convert it to a string to easily access its digits.\n    3. Check if the number is divisible by each of its digits.\n    4. If a number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result list.\n    5. Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n# [edge case] \n    divisible_by_digits(1,10) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    Explanation: In this range, all numbers from 1 to 9 are divisible by their only digit, hence they all meet the criteria.\n    divisible_by_digits(20,25) = []\n    Explanation: In this range, 22 is the only number that is divisible by both its digits (2 and 2). The rest of the numbers in the range do not meet the criteria as they are not divisible by at least one of their digits.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to check each number in the range for divisibility by its digits.\n"], "test": ["def check(divisible_by_digits):\n\tassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1,
