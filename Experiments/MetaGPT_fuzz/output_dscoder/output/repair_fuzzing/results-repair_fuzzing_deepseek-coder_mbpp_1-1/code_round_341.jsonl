This can be achieved by leveraging the sign bit of integers, which is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'opposite signs': means that one integer is positive and the other is negative\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To check if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the fact that in binary representation, the sign bit (the most significant bit) can be used to determine the sign of the number. If the most significant bit is set for one number and not for the other, they have opposite signs. This can be achieved using the XOR operator. If the result of XORing the two numbers is negative, then they have opposite signs.\n\n    Here's the logic:\n    1. Take two integers, a and b.\n    2. XOR a and b.\n    3. Check the sign bit of the result. If it's negative, return True, indicating the numbers have opposite signs. Otherwise, return False.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 is neither positive nor negative. Therefore, the function should return False as 0 does not have a sign.\n    opposite_Signs(5, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, 0 is neither positive nor negative, so the function should return False.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: -1 is a negative number and 1 is a positive number, so they have opposite signs. The function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The XOR operation inherently handles the case where one of the numbers is 0, as the result will be non-zero, indicating they do not have opposite signs.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function 'opposite_Signs' needs to be simple and efficient.
