The function should handle edge cases where the element might not be present in the array. The function should be efficient and clear in its implementation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently find the last position of an element in a sorted array.\n- The function should handle edge cases where the element might not be present in the array.\n- The function should be easy to understand and maintain.\nTo efficiently find the last position of an element in a sorted array, we can utilize binary search, which is a popular algorithm for its O(log n) time complexity. This approach will help us avoid the inefficiencies of a linear search, especially for large arrays. We will implement a modified binary search that focuses on finding the last occurrence of the target element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorted array': means the elements are in non-decreasing order\n    'last position': means the index of the last occurrence of the target element\n\n    Explanation: In a sorted array, the elements are arranged in such a way that each element is less than or equal to the next one. To find the last position of a specific element, we need to search for it efficiently, preferably using a binary search approach.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `last` for finding the last position of an element in a sorted array, we can use a binary search algorithm. Here's a detailed logic:\n\n    1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n    2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:\n        a. Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n        b. If the element at `mid` is less than the target, move `left` to `mid + 1`.\n        c. If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to the target, move `right` to `mid - 1`.\n        d. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, update a result variable to `mid` and move `left` to `mid + 1` to continue searching in the right half of the array.\n    3. Return the result variable, which will hold the index of the last occurrence of the target element, or -1 if the element is not present.\n\n# [edge case] \n    last([1,2,3], 1, 3) = 0\n    Explanation: The target element '1' is present in the array [1, 2, 3] at the first position. Since the array is sorted and we are looking for the last position, the expected output is 0.\n    last([1,2,3], 4, 3) = -1\n    Explanation: The target element '4' is not present in the array [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, the function should return -1 indicating the element is not found.\n    last([1,1,1,2,2,3], 2, 6) = 4\n    Explanation: The target element '2' appears multiple times in the array [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3].
