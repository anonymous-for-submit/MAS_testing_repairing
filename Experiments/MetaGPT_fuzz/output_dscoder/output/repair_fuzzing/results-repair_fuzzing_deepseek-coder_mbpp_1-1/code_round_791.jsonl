For each position, we generate all substrings that start at that position and end at any position after it. This method ensures that we consider all possible substrings without making any assumptions about predefined constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'substrings': substrings are contiguous sequences of characters within a string.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to count all possible non-empty substrings of a given string, considering all starting and ending positions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To count the number of non-empty substrings, we can use a nested loop approach. The outer loop will iterate through each starting position of the substring, and the inner loop will iterate through each ending position that comes after the starting position. For each pair of starting and ending positions, we will generate the substring and count it.\n\n# [edge case] \n    number_of_substrings(\"\") = 0\n    Explanation: An empty string has no characters, so it has no non-empty substrings. The expected output is 0.\n    number_of_substrings(\"a\") = 1\n    Explanation: A single-character string \"a\" has exactly one non-empty substring, which is the string itself. The expected output is 1.\n    number_of_substrings(\"ab\") = 3\n    Explanation: The string \"ab\" has three non-empty substrings: \"a\", \"b\", and \"ab\". The expected output is 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the logic provided in the plan already correctly handles the case of an empty string.

Each character in the string can be the starting point of a substring, and for each starting point, we can have a varying length of substrings until we reach the end of the string.
