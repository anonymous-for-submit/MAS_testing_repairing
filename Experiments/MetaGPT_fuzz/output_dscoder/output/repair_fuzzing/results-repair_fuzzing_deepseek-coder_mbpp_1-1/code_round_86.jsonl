This is a basic function that should be straightforward to implement. The function should handle any string input and return the total count of characters, including spaces and punctuation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named count_charac that takes a single argument, a string.\n- The function should return the total number of characters in the string, including spaces and punctuation.\n- Implement error handling to manage non-string inputs gracefully.\n- Include a simple test case to verify the function's correctness.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a function that counts the total number of characters in a given string. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's simplicity and efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character count'\n    The core concept is to count the total number of characters in a given string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using Python's built-in capabilities to create a function that counts the total number of characters in a given string.
