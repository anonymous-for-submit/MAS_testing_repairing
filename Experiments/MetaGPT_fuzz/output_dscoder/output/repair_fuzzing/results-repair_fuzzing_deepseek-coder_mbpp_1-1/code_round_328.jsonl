The function will recursively traverse both input nested tuples, adding corresponding elements together. We will ensure that the function can handle tuples of varying lengths by padding shorter tuples with zeros or handling them as empty tuples. Additionally, we will handle cases where some tuples contain nested empty tuples by treating them as zero values during addition.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'nested tuples': Tuples within tuples, where each element in the outer tuple can be a tuple itself.\n    Explanation: This concept involves handling complex data structures where each element might be another tuple, requiring recursive traversal and operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `add_nested_tuples`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

If both elements being compared are tuples, recursively call the function on these tuples.\n    3.
