The function should return 0 if there are no negative numbers. This is a basic requirement that can be efficiently handled by Python's built-in sum function combined with a simple loop to filter out negative numbers. The function should also be efficient and clear in its implementation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to sum negative numbers correctly.\n- Ensure the function returns 0 if there are no negative numbers.\n- Optimize the function for performance, especially with large datasets.\n- Document the function clearly for easy understanding and maintenance.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\nTo implement the function `sum_negativenum` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities. The function will iterate through the list, check for negative numbers, and sum them up. If no negative numbers are found, it will return 0.
