Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'divisible by each digit': means that for each digit in the number, the number should be divisible by that digit.\n    Explanation: This concept involves checking if a number is divisible by all its individual digits.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through each number in the given range.\n    Convert the number to a string to access each digit.\n    Check if the number is divisible by each of its digits.\n    If a number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result list.\n    Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n# [edge case] \n    divisible_by_digits(1,10) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    Explanation: In the range from 1 to 10, all numbers are divisible by their individual digits since they are all single-digit numbers.\n    divisible_by_digits(20,25) = [24]\n    Explanation: In the range from 20 to 25, only 24 is divisible by both digits 2 and 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all numbers in the specified range.\n"], "test": ["def check(divisible_by_digits):\n\tassert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
