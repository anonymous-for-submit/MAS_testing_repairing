The expected output is a list with elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10, as these are the elements from the source list that are not present in the list to be removed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

This approach is simple and leverages Python's powerful data manipulation capabilities.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'list comprehension': This is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. It allows us to specify what elements to include or exclude in the new list.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to create a new list that excludes certain elements from the original list. List comprehension provides a clean and efficient way to achieve this.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using list comprehension to filter out elements from the source list that are present in the list of elements to be removed. Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Define the function `remove_elements` that takes two parameters: `source_list` and `remove_list`.\n    2. Use list comprehension to iterate over `source_list` and include only those elements that are not in `remove_list`.\n    3. Return the new list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,4,6,8]) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n    Explanation: The function should remove all elements 2, 4, 6, and 8 from the source list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], resulting in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for this specific edge case as list comprehension handles the exclusion of elements efficiently.\n\n# [code implementation]\n```python\ndef remove_elements(source_list, remove_list):\n    return [item for item in source_list if item not in remove_list]\n```\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that removes all elements from a given list that are present in another list. This is a common task in data manipulation and requires the function to iterate through the source list and check for each element if it is in the list of elements to be removed. The function should return a new list with the elements removed.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and handle large lists without performance issues.\n- The function should be able to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with non-unique elements.\n- The UI should be simple and intuitive, with clear instructions on how to use the function.\n- The product should be compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms.\n- The documentation should be clear and comprehensive, explaining how to use the function and its limitations.\nTo implement the function `remove_elements`, we will use Python's built-in list operations and the `filter` function. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strong support for list comprehensions and filtering. The function will iterate through the source list and check if each element is not in the list of elements to be removed, effectively filtering out the unwanted elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'removal of elements': This involves identifying and removing specific elements from a list based on the presence in another list.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to remove all elements from the source list that are present in the list of elements to be removed. This involves checking each element in the source list against the elements in the removal list and including only those that are not present in the removal list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to compare the elements of the source list with the elements of the removal list to determine if they should be included in the result.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'more than' is not directly used in the requirement, but the concept of comparison and inclusion/exclusion based on this comparison is central to the task.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This phrase is not present in the requirement, but the concept of finding the largest element is not directly relevant to the task of removing elements based on presence in another list.\n    Explanation: The requirement focuses on removing elements, not on finding the largest element in the source list.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function `remove_elements`, we can use a list comprehension to filter out elements from the source list that are present in the removal list. This approach ensures that we efficiently check each element in the source list against the removal list and include only those that are not present.\n\n# [edge case] \n    remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,4,6,8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the function's ability to remove specific elements from the source list.
