This approach ensures both simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for handling large texts.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'word length': the length of a word is determined by the number of characters it contains.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to identify words that are longer than a specified number of characters.
