An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The function should be efficient and handle large datasets well. The user interface should be simple and straightforward, providing clear results.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the get_Inv_Count function\n- Ensure the function is optimized for large arrays\n- Create a user-friendly interface for input and output\n- Test the function with various datasets to ensure accuracy and performance\n- Document the function and provide examples of usage\nTo implement the get_Inv_Count function efficiently, we will use a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach is efficient and well-suited for handling large datasets. The merge sort algorithm's divide-and-conquer strategy allows us to count inversions while sorting the array, thus optimizing the process.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'inversion': an element in the array is greater than another element that appears after it.\n    Explanation: Inversion is a measure of how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. A higher number of inversions means the array is more unsorted.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the get_Inv_Count function efficiently, we will use a modified merge sort algorithm.

The original logic of the merge sort algorithm will work correctly for a sorted array without any inversions.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second one and appears before it in the array. The function should be efficient and handle large datasets. The code should also be well-documented and easy to understand.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently calculate the number of inversions.\n- The function should be optimized for large arrays.\n- The code should be well-documented and include examples.\n- The function should be easy to understand and maintain.\n- The product should handle edge cases gracefully.\nTo create an efficient Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array, we will use a combination of a brute-force approach and an optimized merge sort approach. The brute-force method will be used for simplicity and clarity, while the merge sort approach will be optimized for larger datasets.
