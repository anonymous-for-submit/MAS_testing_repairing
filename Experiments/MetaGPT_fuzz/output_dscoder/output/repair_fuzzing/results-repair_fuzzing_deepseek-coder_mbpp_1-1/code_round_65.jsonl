Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Define the function `remove_elements` that takes two lists as arguments.\n    2. Use list comprehension to iterate over the first list and include only those elements that are not present in the second list.\n    3. Return the resulting list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3]) = [4, 5]\n    Explanation: The elements 1, 2, and 3 are present in the second list, so they are removed from the first list, leaving [4, 5].\n    remove_elements([10,20,30,40,50],[30,40,50,60]) = [10, 20]\n    Explanation: The elements 30, 40, and 50 are present in the second list, so they are removed from the first list, leaving [10, 20].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic using list comprehension inherently handles cases where the second list contains elements not present in the first list, ensuring that only elements from the first list are removed.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that removes all elements from a given list that are present in another list. This is a common task in data manipulation and requires the function to be efficient and easy to understand.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be clear and concise, using Pythonic practices.\n- The function should handle both lists of integers and mixed types.\n- The function should be optimized for performance, especially for large lists.\n- The function should provide detailed error handling for unexpected inputs.\n- The function should include comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to create a function that efficiently removes all elements from a given list that are present in another list. This will be achieved using list comprehension, which is both clear and concise, aligning with Pythonic practices.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'removal of elements': The core concept involves identifying and removing specific elements from a list based on the presence in another list.\n    Explanation: This requirement focuses on the process of filtering out elements from one list that are found in a second list, effectively producing a new list that excludes the specified elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `remove_elements`, we can use list comprehension to filter out elements from the first list that are present in the second list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n    1. Define the function `remove_elements` with two parameters, `lst1` and `lst2`.\n    2. Use list comprehension to iterate over `lst1` and include only those elements that are not in `lst2`.\n    3. Return the resulting list.\n\n    Here's the code implementation:\n    ```python\n    def remove_elements(lst1, lst2):\n        return [x for x in lst1 if x not in lst2]\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,4,6,8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the function's ability to remove all specified elements (2, 4, 6, 8) from the original list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The expected output is a list with these elements removed, resulting in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for this edge case as the provided list comprehension already handles the removal of elements effectively.\n"], "test": ["def check(remove_elements):\n\tassert remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,4,6,8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]", "def
