The function should handle tuples of varying lengths and return a tuple containing the differing elements. This requirement is clear and specific, aligning well with the product goals of creating an efficient and user-friendly function.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and handle tuples of varying lengths.\n- The function should accurately identify the differing components between two tuples.\n- Ensure the function is user-friendly and easy to integrate.\n- Enhance the speed and accuracy of identifying differences.\nTo create a function that efficiently identifies the differing components between two tuples, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the `collections.Counter` class for a straightforward solution. This approach ensures that the function handles tuples of varying lengths effectively and accurately identifies the differences.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'differing components': means the elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.\n    'efficiently': means the function should handle large tuples without performance issues.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Combine both tuples into a single iterable.\n    - Use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element.\n    - Identify elements that appear in only one of the tuples.\n    - Return a tuple containing these differing elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_dissimilar((1, 2, 3), (1, 2)) = (3,)\n    explanation: The first tuple has an extra element '3' that is not in the second tuple.\n    find_dissimilar((1, 2), (1, 2, 3)) = (3,)\n    explanation: The second tuple has an extra element '3' that is not in the first tuple.\n    find_dissimilar((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n    explanation: Both tuples are completely different, so all elements are returned.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can handle tuples of varying lengths efficiently.\n"], "test": ["def check(find_dissimilar):\n\tassert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)",
