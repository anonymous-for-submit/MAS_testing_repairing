This is a common task in string manipulation and is useful for data cleaning and preparation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named move_num that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all numbers moved to the end.\n- The function should handle strings containing only letters and numbers.\n- The function should maintain the order of non-number characters as they appear in the original string.\nTo implement the function move_num, we will use Python's built-in string manipulation methods. The function will iterate through the input string, separating characters into two groups: numbers and non-numbers. It will then concatenate these groups in the order of their original appearance, with all numbers moved to the end.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'string manipulation'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the ability to manipulate and rearrange characters within a string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function should:\n    1.
