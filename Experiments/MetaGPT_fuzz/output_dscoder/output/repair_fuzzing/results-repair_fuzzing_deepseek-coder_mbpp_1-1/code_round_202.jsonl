We will also ensure that the function is well-documented to aid understanding and include error handling to manage unexpected inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'heap sort': This is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. The algorithm can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the heap sort algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Build a max heap from the list.\n    2. Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and place it at the end of the list.\n    3. Heapify the remaining heap to maintain the heap property.\n    4. Continue this process until all elements are sorted.\n\n# [edge case] \n    heap_sort([]) = []\n    explanation: An empty list should return an empty list since there are no elements to sort.\n    heap_sort([1]) = [1]\n    explanation: A single-element list is already sorted, so it should return the same list.\n    heap_sort([5, 1, 4, 2, 8]) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]\n    explanation: This list is sorted in ascending order as per the heap sort algorithm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the heap sort algorithm inherently handles single-element lists without additional processing.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a basic implementation of the heap sort algorithm in Python:\n\n    ```python\n    import heapq\n\n    def heap_sort(lst):\n        if not lst:\n            return []\n        heapq.heapify(lst)\n        sorted_lst = []\n        while lst:\n            sorted_lst.append(heapq.heappop(lst))\n        return sorted_lst\n    ```\n\n    This code uses the `heapq` module to efficiently build a heap from the list and then pop elements from the heap to sort the list.\n"], "test": ["def
