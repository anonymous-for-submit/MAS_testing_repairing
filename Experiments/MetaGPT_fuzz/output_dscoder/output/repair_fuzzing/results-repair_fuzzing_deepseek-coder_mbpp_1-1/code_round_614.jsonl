If both conditions are met, we increment the inversion count.\n\n    Here's a Python function to count inversions using a brute-force approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def get_Inv_Count(arr, n):\n        inv_count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                    inv_count += 1\n        return inv_count\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_Inv_Count([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) = 0\n    Explanation: In this case, the array is already sorted in ascending order, so there are no inversions. Each element is greater than or equal to the elements that come after it.\n\n    get_Inv_Count([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 5) = 10\n    Explanation: The array is sorted in descending order, so every pair (i, j) where i < j and arr[i] > arr[j] is an inversion. There are 10 such pairs in this array.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The brute-force approach already correctly counts inversions for sorted arrays. However, for optimization, we can use more advanced algorithms like merge sort, which is more efficient for large datasets.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array.

The brute-force approach involves checking each pair in the array to see if it forms an inversion. For optimization, we will use a modified merge sort algorithm, which is efficient and works in O(n log n) time complexity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'inversion': A pair of indices (i, j) with i < j and array[i] > array[j]\n    Explanation: An inversion in an array is a situation where a larger element appears before a smaller element. The goal is to count all such pairs in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the get_Inv_Count function using a brute-force approach, we can use two nested loops. The outer loop picks the first element, and the inner loop picks the second element. If the first element is greater than the second, we increment the inversion count. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is less efficient for large arrays.\n\n    For optimization, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. This algorithm works by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays until they are small enough to be sorted easily. Then, it merges these sorted subarrays back together while counting the inversions. The merge step involves comparing elements from both subarrays and ensuring that the merged array is sorted.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_Inv_Count([1, 3, 2, 4], 4) = 1\n    Explanation: The pair (1, 2) is an inversion because 1 < 2 and 1 > 2. There are no other inversions in this array.\n    get_Inv_Count([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 5) = 10\n    Explanation: There are multiple inversions in this array. The pairs are (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 1).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array is already sorted in descending order. In such cases, the brute-force approach would still check all pairs, leading to a count of inversions equal to the number of pairs, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\n    For the optimized approach using merge sort, we need to modify the merge function to count inversions. If an element from the right subarray is placed before an element from the left subarray, it means there are inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.\n\n    Here is the extra code for the edge case:\n    ```python\n    def get_Inv_Count(arr, n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return 0\n        temp_arr = [0] * n\n        return _merge_sort(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)\n\n    def _merge_sort(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n        inv_count = 0\n        if left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            inv_count += _merge_sort(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n            inv_count += _merge_sort(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n            inv_count += merge(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n        return inv_count\n\n    def merge(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n        i = left     # Starting index for left subarray\n        j = mid + 1  # Starting index for right subarray\n        k = left     # Starting index to be sorted\n        inv_count = 0\n\n        # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n        while i <= mid and j <= right:\n            if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n                temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n                k += 1\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray are greater than arr[j]\n                temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n                inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n                k += 1\n                j += 1\n\n        # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n        while i <= mid:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            k += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n        while j <= right:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            k += 1\n            j += 1\n\n        # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n        return inv_count\n    ```\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array.
