Collect the results and return them as a new tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    tuple_modulo((1, 2, 3), (0, 0, 0)) = (0, 0, 0)\n    Explanation: Since the second tuple contains zeros, the modulo operation for each element will result in zero. This is a default behavior we can choose to handle division by zero.\n    tuple_modulo((1, 2, 3), (1, 1, 0)) = (0, 1, 0)\n    Explanation: The third element of the second tuple is zero, causing a division by zero error. We catch this error and return 0 for that element.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where a division by zero occurs.\n        try:\n            result = a % b\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            result = 0\n\n    This code snippet catches the ZeroDivisionError and returns 0 for the element where the error occurred.\n"], "test": ["def
