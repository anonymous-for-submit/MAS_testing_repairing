The sequence starts with P(1) = 1 and P(2) = 1, and each subsequent term is defined as P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n - P(n-1)).\n    Explanation: The Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of integers where each number is defined by the sum of two previous numbers in the sequence, which are themselves defined by the same rule.

We'll create a function that uses memoization to store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n    1. Define a function `sequence(n, memo={})` that takes an integer `n` and a dictionary `memo` for memoization.\n    2. If `n` is 1 or 2, return 1 since P(1) = 1 and P(2) = 1.\n    3. Check if the value of `n` is already in `memo`. If yes, return the stored value.\n    4. Otherwise, compute the value using the recursive formula P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n - P(n-1)) and store it in `memo`.\n    5. Return the computed value.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sequence(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence starts with P(1) = 1, so the first number in the sequence is 1.\n    sequence(2) = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence starts with P(2) = 1, so the second number in the sequence is also 1.\n    sequence(5) = 3\n    Explanation: Using the recursive formula, P(5) = P(P(4)) + P(5 - P(4)). Calculating P(4) and P(3) recursively, we get P(4) = P(P(3)) + P(4 - P(3)) = P(2) + P(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, and P(3) = P(P(2)) + P(3 - P(2)) = P(1) + P(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, P(5) = P(2) + P(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. However, this is incorrect based on the sequence definition. Correcting the calculation, P(5) = P(P(4)) + P(5 - P(4)) = P(3) + P(1) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 0.
