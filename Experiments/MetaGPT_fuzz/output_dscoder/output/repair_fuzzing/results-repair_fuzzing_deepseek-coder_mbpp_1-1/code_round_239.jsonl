This feature differentiates our product from others by offering a more robust solution for list comparison tasks.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code for the Diff function must accurately calculate the difference between two lists, considering duplicates.\n- The function should be optimized for performance, ensuring it can handle large datasets without significant delays.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for easy integration and use of the Diff function.\n- Include detailed documentation and examples to assist users in understanding how to use the Diff function effectively.\n- Test the function across various scenarios, including edge cases with large numbers of duplicates, to ensure reliability and accuracy.\nTo create a function that calculates the difference between two lists, including duplicates, we will use Python's built-in data structures and set operations. The function will first convert the lists to sets to eliminate duplicates, then perform set difference operations, and finally convert the result back to a list.
