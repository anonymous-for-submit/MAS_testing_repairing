The function should be easy to use and integrate into existing projects.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to remove characters from the first string that are present in the second string.\n- Ensure the function is case-insensitive, handling both uppercase and lowercase characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance and efficiency.\nTo implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will use Python's built-in string manipulation methods along with the `str.translate` function which is efficient for character removal. This function will create a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each character in the second string to `None`, effectively removing it from the first string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character removal': The core concept involves removing specific characters from a given string based on the presence in another string.\n    Explanation: This requirement focuses on identifying and removing characters from the first string that are found in the second string. This is crucial for cleaning up the first string by eliminating unwanted characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

This involves checking each substring for the specified condition and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'equal to': means that the sum of the digits in the substring should match its length.\n    Explanation: For example, in the substring '123', the sum of the digits is 6, and the length is 3. If these two values are equal, the substring meets the criteria.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': means that the sum of the digits must exactly match the length of the substring.\n    Explanation: This implies that the sum of the digits should not be greater or less than the length; it must be exactly the same.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_Substrings`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

The lambda function will extract the second element of each tuple, which allows the sorting to handle varying data types automatically.\n\n# [edge case] \n    subject_marks([('English', '88'), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97), ('Social sciences', 82)]) = [('Social sciences', 82), ('English', '88'), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97)]\n    Explanation:\n    The function should be able to handle tuples with string representations of numbers in the second position. The `sorted` function will convert these strings to integers for comparison, ensuring the correct order.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The `sorted` function in Python is designed to handle various data types and will sort the list of tuples based on the second element correctly.\n"], "test": ["def check(subject_marks):\n\tassert

Return the total sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]]) = 21\n    Explanation: The function will sum all elements in the list, including those in nested lists. The expected output is the sum of all numbers in the list, which is 21.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic will correctly sum all elements, including those in nested lists.\n"], "test": ["def check(recursive_list_sum):\n\tassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21", "def

The function should handle arrays of varying lengths and data ranges efficiently. This is crucial for applications where data integrity and processing speed are important.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and clear in checking monotonicity.\n- The function should handle arrays of any length and data range.\n- Ensure the function is user-friendly and easy to integrate into other projects.\n- Provide a solution that works well with other Python libraries and tools.\n- Consider the performance and scalability of the function.\nTo create an efficient and clear solution for checking monotonicity, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and ensure the function handles arrays of any length and data range efficiently. We will avoid using external libraries for simplicity and clarity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'monotonic': A sequence is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.\n    Explanation: A sequence is monotonic if it does not change direction, either always increasing or always decreasing.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To check if an array is monotonic, we can iterate through the array and compare each element with the next one. If we find any element that is greater than the next, or less than the next, the array is not monotonic. If we reach the end without finding such a pair, the array is monotonic.\n\n    Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Initialize two boolean variables, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to `True`.\n    2.

This approach will help in multiplying all elements in the list and then dividing by the count of elements, ensuring robustness against division by zero by checking the list's non-emptiness.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'multiplication' and 'division'\n    The core concept involves multiplying all elements in a list and then dividing the result by the number of elements in the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the 'multiply_num' function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, raise a ValueError because division by zero is not allowed.\n    2. Use the 'functools.reduce' function to multiply all elements in the list.\n    3. Divide the result of the multiplication by the length of the list.\n    4. Return the final result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    multiply_num([]) = ValueError\n    Explanation: Since the list is empty, attempting to divide by zero would cause a runtime error. This is an edge case that must be handled to ensure the function does not crash.\n    multiply_num([5, 5, 5]) = 5.0\n    Explanation: When all elements in the list are the same, multiplying them all together and then dividing by the count of elements results in the original element value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if not lst:\n            raise ValueError(\"The list is empty, cannot divide by zero.\")\n        (other code)\n\n    This additional code checks if the list is empty and raises a ValueError if it is, preventing the function from attempting to divide by zero.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that multiplies all numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list.

Return the maximum length found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_length(\"0000\") = 0\n    Explanation: Since the entire string consists of 0s, there are no 1s to balance them out. Therefore, the maximum difference is 0.\n    find_length(\"1111\") = 0\n    Explanation: Similarly, since the entire string consists of 1s, there are no 0s to balance them out. Therefore, the maximum difference is 0.\n    find_length(\"101010\") = 6\n    Explanation: The entire string has an equal number of 0s and 1s, so the maximum difference is the length of the string itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can handle strings with all 0s, all 1s, or a mix of 0s and 1s.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of a given binary string. This involves counting the number of 0s and 1s in each sub-string and finding the maximum difference. The function should be efficient and handle binary strings of varying lengths.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to find the maximum difference between 0s and 1s in any sub-string of a binary string.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance, especially for longer binary strings.\n- Include error handling for non-binary string inputs.\n- Allow the function to handle binary strings of different lengths.\n- Provide documentation and examples to help users understand how to use the function.\nTo solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of a given binary string, we will use a sliding window approach. This method will allow us to efficiently scan through the binary string and calculate the differences in real-time. We will also use a dictionary to keep track of the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s, which will help us determine the maximum difference efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary string': a string composed of '0's and '1's\n    'sub-string': a contiguous sequence of characters within a string\n    'maximum difference': the largest difference between the number of '0's and '1's in any sub-string\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `find_length`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the current difference (`curr_diff`) between the number of '0's and '1's.\n    2. Use a sliding window approach to iterate through the binary string.\n    3. For each character in the string, update the counts of '0's and '1's.\n    4. Calculate the current difference (`curr_diff`) between the counts of '0's and '1's.\n    5. Update the `max_diff` if the current difference is greater than the current `max_diff`.\n    6. Return the `max_diff` as the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_length(\"0000\") = 0\n    explanation: Since the entire string consists of '0's, the difference between the number of '0's and '1's is zero.\n    find_length(\"1111\") = 0\n    explanation: Since the entire string consists of '1's, the difference between the number of '0's and '1's is zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan will correctly handle strings with all '0's or all '1's.\n"], "test": ["def check(find_length):\n\tassert find_length(\"11000010001\", 11) == 6", "def

The function should be efficient and easy to understand, suitable for both mathematicians and programmers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main function should accurately convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.\n- The function should handle the case where the complex number is zero.\n- The function should be easy to understand and use.\n- The function should be optimized for readability and maintainability.\n- The function should be efficient in terms of computational time.\nTo create a Python function that converts complex numbers to polar coordinates, we will use the built-in 'cmath' module, which provides mathematical functions for complex numbers. This module is part of the Python standard library, making it straightforward to use and understand. We will ensure the function handles the special case where the complex number is zero by explicitly checking for this condition.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'complex number': A number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit, that satisfies the equation i^2 = -1.\n    'polar coordinates': A set of coordinates that identifies a point in a plane, using a distance from a fixed point (the origin) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To convert a complex number to polar coordinates, we can use the 'cmath.polar' function, which returns a tuple (r, phi) where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and phi is the angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point. We need to handle the special case where the input complex number is zero, which should return (0.0, 0.0) since the magnitude is zero and the angle is undefined.\n\n# [edge case] \n    convert(0) = (0.0, 0.0)\n    Explanation: The magnitude of zero is zero, and the angle is undefined in this case, so we return (0.0, 0.0).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case since the 'cmath.polar' function already returns the correct values for zero.\n"], "test": ["def check(convert):\n\tassert convert(1) == (1.0, 0.0)", "def check(convert):\n\tassert
