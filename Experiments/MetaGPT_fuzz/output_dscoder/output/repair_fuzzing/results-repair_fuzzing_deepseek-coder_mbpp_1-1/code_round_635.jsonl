This approach will allow us to efficiently compute the result without running into performance issues for reasonable numbers of posts and colors.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic programming': This is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_no_of_ways`, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a list to store the number of ways to paint the fence up to the current post, considering the constraints.\n\n    Let's denote `dp[i]` as the number of ways to paint the fence with `i` posts, where `i` starts from 0. We need to initialize the first few values and then use a loop to fill in the rest of the values based on the previous values.\n\n    - If there's only 1 post, there are `k` ways to paint it.\n    - If there are 2 posts, there are `k * k` ways to paint them because each post can be painted independently.\n    - For more than 2 posts, the number of ways to paint the `i-th` post depends on whether the `(i-1)-th` and `(i-2)-th` posts have the same color or not. If they have the same color, the `i-th` post can only be painted with a color different from the `(i-1)-th` post, giving us `(k-1) * dp[i-2]` ways. If they have different colors, the `i-th` post can be painted in any of the `k` colors, giving us `k * dp[i-1]` ways.\n\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n    ```\n    dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-2] + dp[i-1])\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_no_of_ways(2, 4) = 16\n    Explanation: With 2 posts and 4 colors, each post can be painted independently in 4 ways, and since there are 2 posts, the total number of ways to paint the fence is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the given edge case since the base cases and the recurrence relation cover all scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the number of ways to paint a fence with a given number of posts and colors, ensuring that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.

We will maintain two variables to keep track of the number of ways to paint the last two posts:\n    1. `same_color`: the number of ways to paint the last two posts with the same color.\n    2. `diff_color`: the number of ways to paint the last two posts with different colors.\n    We will update these variables iteratively for each post from 1 to n, using the following rules:\n    - If the current post is painted the same color as the previous one, the number of ways to paint the current pair is `diff_color * (k - 1)`.\n    - If the current post is painted a different color from the previous one, the number of ways to paint the current pair is `(same_color + diff_color) * (k - 1)`.\n    Finally, the total number of ways to paint the fence is the sum of `same_color` and `diff_color`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_no_of_ways(1, 4) = 4\n    Explanation: With only one post, there are 4 ways to paint it since there are 4 colors available.\n    count_no_of_ways(0, 4) = 0\n    Explanation: If there are no posts, there are no ways to paint them.\n    count_no_of_ways(3, 2) = 6\n    Explanation: With 3 posts and 2 colors, we can paint the first two posts in 2 ways (both the same or both different), and the third post can be painted in 1 way (different from the previous one), giving us a total of 2 * 1 = 2 ways. However, we need to consider the cases where the last two posts are the same or different, leading to 6 ways in total.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
