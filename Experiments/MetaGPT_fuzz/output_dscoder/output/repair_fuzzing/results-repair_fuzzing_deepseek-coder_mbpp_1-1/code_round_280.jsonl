The logic in the function inherently handles cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'sliding window': This is a technique where a subset of data (a window) is moved from one end of a larger data structure to the other, often to perform a calculation or comparison.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find all occurrences of a substring within a string, including overlapping instances. The sliding window technique is used to move through the string and check for the substring at each position.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'overlapping instances': This phrase indicates that we need to count instances where the substring overlaps with itself.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to count how many times a substring appears within a string, including overlapping instances. This means we need to check each position in the string for the presence of the substring, including overlapping positions.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the 'how_many_times' function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Get the input string and substring from the user.\n    2. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of occurrences.\n    3. Iterate through the original string using a sliding window approach.\n    4. Check if the current substring matches the input substring.\n    5. If a match is found, increment the counter variable.\n    6. Return the final count of occurrences.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: '' appears four times in the original string. 'abc'.count('') returns 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that can traverse through a nested tuple and filter out elements that are not even.
