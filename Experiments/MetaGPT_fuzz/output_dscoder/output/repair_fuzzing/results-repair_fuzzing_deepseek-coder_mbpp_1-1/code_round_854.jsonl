This approach will help us handle large numbers by storing intermediate results, thus avoiding redundant calculations. We will also ensure that the function is optimized for performance and can handle large inputs gracefully.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Bell numbers': Bell numbers are a sequence of integers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. They are named after Eric Temple Bell, who studied them in the early 20th century. Bell numbers can be computed using dynamic programming, which involves building up solutions to larger problems from solutions to smaller problems.\n\n    Explanation: Bell numbers are a sequence of integers where each number represents the number of ways to partition a set of size n into non-empty subsets. For example, Bell(2) = 2, meaning there are 2 ways to partition a set of 2 elements into non-empty subsets.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To compute Bell numbers using dynamic programming, we can use a 2D array where `dp[i][j]` represents the Bell number for set size `i` and partition size `j`. The algorithm involves initializing the first column of the array to 1 (since there's only one way to partition a set of size 0) and then iteratively filling in the rest of the array based on the recurrence relation:\n    ```\n    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-1]\n    ```\n    This relation comes from the fact that the number of ways to partition a set of size `i` into `j` non-empty subsets is the sum of the ways to partition the same set into `j-1` non-empty subsets and then adding the `i-th` element to each of those subsets, and the ways to partition the set of size `i-1` into `j` subsets and then adding the `i-th` element as a new subset.\n\n# [edge case] \n    bell_number(0) = 1\n    Explanation: There is exactly one way to partition a set of size 0 (which is the empty set).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge case since the algorithm already handles the smallest possible input (0) correctly.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The algorithm already correctly computes Bell numbers for all non-negative integers, including 0.\n"], "test": ["def check(bell_number):\n\tassert bell_number(2)==2", "def
