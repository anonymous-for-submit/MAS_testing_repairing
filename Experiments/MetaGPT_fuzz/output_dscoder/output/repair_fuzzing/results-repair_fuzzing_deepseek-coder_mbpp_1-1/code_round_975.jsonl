This is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, including data processing and comparison.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `minimum` function, we can use Python's built-in `min` function which directly returns the smallest of the two arguments passed to it. We will also include a simple check to ensure that the inputs are numbers (integers or floats) to avoid errors with non-numeric types.\n\n    ```python\n    def minimum(a, b):\n        # Check if both inputs are numbers\n        if isinstance(a, (int, float)) and isinstance(b, (int, float)):\n            return min(a, b)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Both inputs must be numbers (integers or floats).\")\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    minimum(1, 2) = 1\n    Explanation: The function correctly returns the smaller of the two numbers provided, which is 1 in this case.\n    minimum(3.5, 2.1) = 2.1\n    Explanation: The function correctly returns the smaller of the two numbers provided, which is 2.1 in this case.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The built-in `min` function already covers the basic scenario effectively.\n\n    However, if we consider more complex edge cases such as very large numbers or very small numbers (close to floating-point precision limits), we might need to add additional checks to ensure accurate results. But for the basic requirement of finding the minimum of two numbers, no extra code is necessary.\n"], "test": ["def check(minimum):\n\tassert minimum(1,2) == 1", "def check(minimum):\n\tassert
