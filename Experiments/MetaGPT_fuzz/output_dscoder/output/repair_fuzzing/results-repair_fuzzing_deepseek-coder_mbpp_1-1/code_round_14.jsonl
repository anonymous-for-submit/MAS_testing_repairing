Otherwise, it will return a positive number.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'opposite signs': means that one integer is positive and the other is negative.\n    Explanation: In binary representation, positive numbers start with a 0 bit (except for zero), while negative numbers start with a 1 bit. Using the XOR operator between two integers can determine if they have opposite signs because the result will be negative if they are of opposite signs.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the 'opposite_Signs' function, we can use the XOR operator. Here's the detailed logic:\n    1. Take two integers as input.\n    2. Use the XOR operator (`^`) between the two integers.\n    3. Check the sign of the result:\n        - If the result is negative, return `True` (indicating the integers have opposite signs).\n        - If the result is positive, return `False` (indicating the integers do not have opposite signs).\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 is neither positive nor negative, so the function should return `False` as it does not have opposite signs with any positive or negative number.\n    opposite_Signs(5, -5) = True\n    Explanation: The numbers 5 and -5 are of opposite signs, so the function should return `True`.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, the numbers -1 and 1 are of opposite signs, so the function should return `True`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge cases as the XOR operation inherently handles the sign check correctly. The provided logic is sufficient to determine if two integers have opposite signs.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function 'opposite_Signs' needs to be able to determine if two integers have opposite signs. This is typically done by checking if the product of the two numbers is negative. If the product is negative, the numbers have opposite signs. This function is fundamental for ensuring that the game's logic correctly handles positive and negative numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code for the game should be efficient and scalable.\n- The game algorithm should handle all edge cases, including negative numbers.\n- Implement a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop platforms.\n- Include accessibility features to cater to a wider user base.\nTo create the 'opposite_Signs' function efficiently and accurately, we will use Python's built-in capabilities. The function will take two integers as input and return a boolean value indicating whether they have opposite signs. This can be determined by checking if the product of the two numbers is negative. This approach is simple and leverages Python's straightforward syntax for mathematical operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'opposite signs': means that one integer is positive and the other is negative.\n    Explanation: In Python, the product of two numbers with opposite signs will always be negative. This is because a positive number multiplied by a negative number results in a negative product.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function 'opposite_Signs' should take two integers as input, multiply them, and check if the result is negative. If the result is negative, it means the numbers have opposite signs, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 is neither positive nor negative. Therefore, the function should return `False` when comparing 0 with any other number, including 5.\n    opposite_Signs(5, 0) = False\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, the function should return `False` when comparing 5 with 0.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: The product of -1 and 1 is -1, which is negative. Therefore, the function should return `True` indicating that the numbers have opposite signs.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge cases provided. The logic to check if the product of two numbers is negative naturally handles these cases without additional code.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function 'opposite_Signs' needs to be able to determine if two integers have opposite signs.
