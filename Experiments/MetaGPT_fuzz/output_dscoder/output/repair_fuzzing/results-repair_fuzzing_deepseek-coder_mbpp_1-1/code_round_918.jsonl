In this case, 10 is larger than 5, so the function returns 10.\n    maximum(10, 5) = 10\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, but with the inputs reversed. The function still returns the larger value, which is 10.\n    maximum('a', 'b') = 'b'\n    Explanation: When comparing strings, the function returns the larger string lexicographically. In this case, 'b' comes after 'a' in the alphabet, so the function returns 'b'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for these edge cases as the basic comparison logic in the function already handles them. The function will return the larger value regardless of the input type, as long as the comparison is valid (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.).\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirement is straightforward: to create a function that takes two inputs and returns the larger one.
