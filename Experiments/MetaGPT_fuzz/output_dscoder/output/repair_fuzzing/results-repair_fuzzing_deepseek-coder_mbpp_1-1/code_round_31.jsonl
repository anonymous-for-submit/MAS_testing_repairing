Here's the detailed logic:\n\n    1. Define a function named `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n    2. Inside the function, use the formula (3n^2 - 3n + 1) to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.\n    3. Return the calculated number.\n\n# [edge case] \n    centered_hexagonal_number(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The first centered hexagonal number is 1, as per the formula (3*1^2 - 3*1 + 1).\n    centered_hexagonal_number(2) = 7\n    Explanation: The second centered hexagonal number is 7, as per the formula (3*2^2 - 3*2 + 1).\n    centered_hexagonal_number(3) = 19\n    Explanation: The third centered hexagonal number is 19, as per the formula (3*3^2 - 3*3 + 1).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed to handle the edge cases as the formula directly computes the nth centered hexagonal number for any positive integer n.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should accurately calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula: H(n) = 3n(n-1) + 1.

Using the formula, H(-1) = 3*(-1)*(-2) + 1 = 7, which is not a valid centered hexagonal number as it is positive. This edge case highlights the need to ensure the input is a positive integer.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this simple mathematical formula implementation. The function will naturally handle edge cases like non-positive integers by returning results that do not fit the intended sequence of centered hexagonal numbers.
