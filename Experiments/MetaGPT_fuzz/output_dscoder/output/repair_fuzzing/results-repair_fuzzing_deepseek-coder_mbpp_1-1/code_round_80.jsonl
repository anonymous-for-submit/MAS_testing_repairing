The solution should be optimized for performance, especially for large datasets. The function should be simple to use and integrate into other projects.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be optimized for performance.\n- The function should handle large datasets efficiently.\n- The function should be easy to use and understand.\n- The function should be easily integrable into other projects.\n- The function should handle edge cases gracefully.\nTo create an efficient function that returns the n largest elements from a list, we will utilize Python's built-in 'heapq' module, which is designed for heap-related operations. This module provides an efficient way to find the n largest elements from an iterable. We will ensure that the function is optimized for performance, handling both small and large datasets effectively.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'largest elements': means the top n elements in terms of value from a list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using the 'heapq.nlargest' function from the Python 'heapq' module to efficiently find the n largest elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    larg_nnum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) = []\n    Explanation: If n is 0, the function should return an empty list since no elements are requested.\n    larg_nnum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10) = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: If n is greater than the length of the list, the function should return the entire list sorted in descending order.\n    larg_nnum([], 3) = []\n    Explanation: If the list is empty, the function should return an empty list regardless of the value of n.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
