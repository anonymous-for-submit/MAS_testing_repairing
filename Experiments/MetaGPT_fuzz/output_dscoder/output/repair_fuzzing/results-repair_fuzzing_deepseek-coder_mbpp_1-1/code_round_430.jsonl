This is a common task in data manipulation and should be implemented efficiently. The function should handle lists with at least two elements to ensure meaningful output. Edge cases such as lists with duplicate consecutive elements should also be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently generate pairs of consecutive elements from a list.\n- Ensure the function handles lists with at least two elements.\n- Include functionality to manage lists with duplicate consecutive elements.\nTo implement the function pair_wise, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and the itertools library to efficiently generate pairs of consecutive elements from a list. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency in handling the task.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'consecutive pairs': means pairs of elements that appear one after another in the list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    We need to iterate through the list and create pairs of consecutive elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pair_wise([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n    Explanation:\n    The function should return all pairs of consecutive elements in the list. The edge case considers a list with duplicate consecutive elements.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic will correctly handle lists with duplicate consecutive elements.\n"], "test": ["def check(pair_wise):\n\tassert pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5])==[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3,
