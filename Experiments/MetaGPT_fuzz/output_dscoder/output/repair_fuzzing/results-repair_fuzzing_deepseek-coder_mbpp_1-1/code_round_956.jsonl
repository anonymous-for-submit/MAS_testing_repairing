We will also ensure that the function gracefully handles cases where division by zero occurs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-wise operation': This means that each element in the first tuple is divided by the corresponding element in the second tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `division_elements` function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the lengths of the two tuples are equal. If not, raise a ValueError.\n    2. Use the zip function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously.\n    3. For each pair of elements, perform the division operation.\n    4. Handle the case where division by zero occurs by checking if the second tuple's element is zero before performing the division.\n    5. Return a new tuple containing the results of the division operations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 0, 3, 3)) = ValueError\n    Explanation: Division by zero occurs because the second tuple has a zero at the second position. This is an edge case that should raise a ValueError.\n    division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3)) = ValueError\n    Explanation: The tuples are of unequal lengths, which is not handled by the function. This is an edge case that should raise a ValueError.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the tuples are of unequal lengths.\n        if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):\n            raise ValueError(\"Tuples must be of the same length\")\n\n    This check ensures that the function only proceeds if the tuples are of equal length, thus handling the edge case.\n"], "test": ["def check(division_elements):\n\tassert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)", "def check(division_elements):\n\tassert division_elements((12, 6, 8,
