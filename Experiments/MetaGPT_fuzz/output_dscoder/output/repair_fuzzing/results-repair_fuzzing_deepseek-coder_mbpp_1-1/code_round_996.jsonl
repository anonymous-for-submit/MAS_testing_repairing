It can have a value of either 0 or 1. A set bit is a bit that is set to 1. Counting the set bits in a number can be useful in various applications, including error-correcting codes, data compression, and cryptography.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently count the set bits in a given number, we can use Python's built-in bitwise operations. The idea is to use the bitwise AND operation to check each bit of the number from right to left. We can do this by continuously shifting the number to the right and checking the least significant bit (LSB). If the LSB is 1, we increment our count. This process is repeated until the number becomes 0.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_Set_Bits(0) = 0\n    Explanation: The number 0 in binary is represented as 0.
