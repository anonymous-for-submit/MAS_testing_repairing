The dynamic programming approach inherently handles cases with negative numbers and different input sizes.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to find the maximum product from a sequence of numbers where the subsequence is strictly increasing. This involves identifying the longest increasing subsequence and then calculating the product of its elements. The function should be efficient and handle edge cases well.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to find the maximum product of numbers in an increasing subsequence.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for both time and space complexity.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Provide clear documentation and examples for user guidance.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\nTo implement the function `max_product` efficiently, we will use dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and then compute the product of its elements. This approach ensures that we can handle large datasets efficiently. We will also include error handling for invalid inputs to ensure robustness.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'increasing subsequence': A subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one.\n    'maximum product': The highest product that can be formed by multiplying elements of the subsequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests using dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). After finding the LIS, we need to compute the product of its elements to find the maximum product.\n\n# [edge case] \n    max_product([1, 2, 3, 4], 4) = 24\n    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], and the product of its elements is 1*2*3*4 = 24.\n    max_product([-1, -2, -3, -4], 4) = -1\n    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [-1, -2, -3, -4], and the product of its elements is (-1)*(-2)*(-3)*(-4) = -1. Note that the product of negative numbers is positive if the count of negative numbers is even.\n    max_product([5, 2, 8, 1], 4) = 80\n    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 5, 8], and the product of its elements is 2*5*8 = 80.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic should work for positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both, as long as the input is valid.\n"], "test": ["def check(max_product):\n\tassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5,
