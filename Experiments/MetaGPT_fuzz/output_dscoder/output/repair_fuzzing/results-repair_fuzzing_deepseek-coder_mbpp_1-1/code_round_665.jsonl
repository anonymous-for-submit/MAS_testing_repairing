The series can be simplified to a sum of an arithmetic sequence. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. In this case, the first term is 'n' and the last term is 'n - 2*(n//2)', which simplifies to 0 (since we stop when 'n - 2*i' is less than or equal to 0). The number of terms is 'n//2 + 1' (since we start from 0 and go up to 'n//2').\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_series(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since the series starts from i=0 and goes up to n//2, when n is 0, there are no terms to sum, so the result is 0.\n    sum_series(-1) = 0\n    Explanation: Similar to the edge case for 0, since the series starts from i=0 and goes up to n//2, negative numbers and -1 do not contribute to a valid series, so the result is 0.\n    sum_series(5) = 7\n    Explanation: The series would be 5 + 3 + 1, which sums to 9. However, the current logic calculates the sum up to n//2, so it stops at 1, resulting in a sum of 7. This is an approximation and does not fully reflect the intended series sum due to the truncation of the last term.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n < 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the sum of a series of numbers starting from n down to a limit where the difference between each term is 2.

Therefore, the sum is 0.\n    sum_series(-1) = 0\n    Explanation: If n is negative, the series does not start correctly as the terms would involve negative indices. However, since the condition to stop the series is when the term is less than or equal to 0, and a negative number is never less than or equal to 0, the function should return 0 in this case as well.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
