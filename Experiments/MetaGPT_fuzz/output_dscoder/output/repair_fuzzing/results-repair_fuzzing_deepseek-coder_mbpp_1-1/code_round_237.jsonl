The function should handle lists with at least two elements to ensure meaningful output.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input and returns a list of tuples, each containing a pair of consecutive elements from the input list.\n- The function should handle lists with fewer than two elements and provide a clear error message or return an empty list to indicate that the input does not meet the requirements for meaningful output.\n- The function should be tested with various inputs to ensure it works correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.\nWe will implement the function pair_wise using Python's built-in capabilities. This function will iterate through the input list, creating pairs of consecutive elements and returning them as a list of tuples. The function will include error handling to ensure the input list has at least two elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'consecutive pairs': means pairs of elements that appear one after another in the list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the list and create pairs of consecutive elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pair_wise([1]) = []\n    Explanation: Since the list has only one element, there are no consecutive pairs, so the expected output is an empty list.\n    pair_wise([]) = []\n    Explanation: An empty list does not have meaningful output, so the expected output is an empty list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(lst) < 2:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive integers': means all elements in the list are positive numbers\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Iterate through the list and create pairs of consecutive elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5]) = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n    Explanation: This edge case checks if the function can handle a list with consecutive pairs and non-consecutive pairs.
