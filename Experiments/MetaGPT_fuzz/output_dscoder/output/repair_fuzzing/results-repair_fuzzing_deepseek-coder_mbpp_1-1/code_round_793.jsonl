["requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that finds the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. This is a classic problem in computer science and can be solved using dynamic programming. The function should be efficient and handle various string lengths.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently find the longest palindromic subsequence.\n- The function should be able to handle strings of different lengths.\n- The solution should be clear and easy to understand.\nTo solve the problem of finding the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string, we will use dynamic programming. This approach will ensure that the function is efficient and can handle various string lengths. We will define a function `lps` that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within that string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'longest palindromic subsequence': This refers to the longest sequence of characters in a string that reads the same backward as forward, without necessarily being contiguous.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `lps`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
