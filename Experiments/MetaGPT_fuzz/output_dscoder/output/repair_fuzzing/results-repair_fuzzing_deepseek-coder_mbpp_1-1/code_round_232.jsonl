The function will first ensure that the list has at least two unique elements to avoid errors, then it will iterate through the list to find the smallest and the second smallest numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'second smallest': means the number that is larger than the smallest but smaller than all other numbers in the list.\n    Explanation: To find the second smallest number, we need to identify the smallest number first and then find the next smallest number that is greater than the smallest number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Steps to implement the function:\n    1. Check if the list has at least two unique elements. If not, return an error or a specific value indicating insufficient data.\n    2. Initialize two variables to keep track of the smallest and second smallest numbers. Set the initial values to positive infinity to ensure any number in the list will be smaller.\n    3. Iterate through the list:\n        - If the current number is smaller than the current smallest, update the second smallest to be the current smallest, and then update the smallest to be the current number.\n        - If the current number is between the smallest and the second smallest, update the second smallest to be the current number.\n    4. After the iteration, the second smallest number will be stored in the second smallest variable.\n    5. Return the second smallest number.\n\n# [edge case] \n    second_smallest([1]) = None or a specific value indicating error\n    Explanation: The list has only one element, so there is no second smallest number.
