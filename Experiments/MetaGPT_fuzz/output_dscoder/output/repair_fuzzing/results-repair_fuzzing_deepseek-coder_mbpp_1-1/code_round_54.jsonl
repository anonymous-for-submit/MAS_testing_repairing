This involves understanding the distribution of 0s and 1s in the string and identifying the sub-string with the largest difference. The function should be efficient and capable of handling large strings.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be optimized for performance.\n- The function should correctly identify the sub-string with the maximum difference between 0s and 1s.\n- Implement a user interface for easy input and output of binary strings.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as strings with no 0s or 1s.\n- Develop a clear and concise user manual for the function.\nTo solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of a binary string, we will use a sliding window approach. This method will help us efficiently scan through the string to identify the sub-string with the largest difference. We will also use a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s, which will allow us to quickly calculate the difference between any two indices in the string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sliding window': This concept involves iterating through a portion of a string or list by moving a window from one end to the other, checking each position within the window.\n    'prefix sum': This is an array where each element at index i represents the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `find_length`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum difference found and the current difference.\n    2. Create a prefix sum array where each element represents the difference between the number of 0s and 1s up to that point in the string.\n    3. Iterate through the string using a sliding window approach, updating the prefix sum and checking for the maximum difference.\n    4. Return the maximum difference found.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_length(\"0000\") = 0\n    Explanation: Since the string consists entirely of 0s, the maximum difference is 0, as there are no 1s to subtract.\n    find_length(\"1111\") = 0\n    Explanation: Similarly, since the string consists entirely of 1s, the maximum difference is 0, as there are no 0s to subtract.\n    find_length(\"101010\") = 6\n    Explanation: The maximum difference is achieved in the entire string, where the difference between the number of 0s and 1s is 3 at each step.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases, as the logic for the sliding window and prefix sum can naturally handle strings with all 0s or all 1s.
