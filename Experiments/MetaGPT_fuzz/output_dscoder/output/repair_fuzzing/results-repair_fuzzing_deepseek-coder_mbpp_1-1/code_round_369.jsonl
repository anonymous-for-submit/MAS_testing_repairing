The function will be written in Python, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle basic operations efficiently. The function will be designed to handle both positive and negative numbers, ensuring broad usability.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'minimum': the smallest value among the two numbers\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to find the smallest value between two numbers. This is a fundamental operation in mathematics and programming.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will compare the two numbers and return the smaller one. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n    ```python\n    def minimum(a, b):\n        if a < b:\n            return a\n        else:\n            return b\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    minimum(5, 5) = 5\n    Explanation: When both numbers are equal, the function should return either of the numbers as they are both the smallest.\n    minimum(-10, -20) = -20\n    Explanation: When both numbers are negative, the function should return the smaller (more negative) number.\n    minimum(0, 0) = 0\n    Explanation: When both numbers are zero, the function should return either of the numbers as they are both the smallest.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers all scenarios including when both numbers are equal.\n"], "test": ["def check(minimum):\n\tassert minimum(1,2) == 1", "def check(minimum):\n\tassert minimum(-5,-4) ==
