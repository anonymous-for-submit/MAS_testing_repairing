This algorithm is a variation of bubble sort where we repeatedly move the maximum item to the end of the list. The function will use a helper function to flip the list to move the maximum item to the beginning, and then flip it to the end. This process is repeated for the length of the list minus one.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorting': the process of arranging elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.\n    'pancake sort': a sorting algorithm that uses a series of \"flips\" to sort a list or array.
