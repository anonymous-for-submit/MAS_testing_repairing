This function is crucial for applications that require analysis of sequential data, such as trend analysis or data transformation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code must include the function 'pair_wise' to return pairs of consecutive items.\n- Implement error handling for lists with fewer than two items.\n- Ensure the function works efficiently even for large lists.\nTo implement the 'pair_wise' function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and ensure it handles edge cases effectively. The function will iterate through the list, creating pairs of consecutive items. If the list has fewer than two items, it will return the single item or handle the empty list appropriately.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'consecutive pairs': means each pair of adjacent elements in a list\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to generate all pairs of consecutive items from a given list.

The steps include:\n    1. Check if the list is empty, return an empty list.\n    2. Check if the list has only one item, return the item itself.\n    3. Iterate through the list to create pairs of consecutive items.\n\n# [edge case] \n    pair_wise([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: Since the list has only one item, the function should return the item itself.\n    pair_wise([]) = []\n    Explanation: If the list is empty, the function should return an empty list.\n    pair_wise([1, 2, 3]) = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\n    Explanation: The function should return a list of pairs of consecutive items from the list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that returns pairs of consecutive items from a list. This is a common task in data processing and should be handled efficiently. The function should also handle edge cases where the list has fewer than two items to avoid errors.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input and returns a list of tuples, each containing a pair of consecutive items from the input list.\n- The function should handle edge cases where the input list has fewer than two items, returning an empty list or a message indicating the list is too short.\n- Implement error handling to manage cases where the input is not a list.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance, especially for large lists.\n- Include unit tests to verify the correctness of the function.\nWe will implement the function `pair_wise` using Python, leveraging the built-in capabilities of the language to handle list operations efficiently. The function will iterate through the list, creating pairs of consecutive items and collecting them into a list of tuples. We will also handle edge cases where the list has fewer than two items by returning an empty list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'consecutive pairs': means pairs of adjacent elements in a list\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to create pairs of consecutive items from a given list.
