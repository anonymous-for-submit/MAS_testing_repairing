This method will allow us to compute the Eulerian number for large inputs quickly. The key idea is to build up the solution for smaller values of n and m, using previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. This approach ensures both time and space efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Eulerian number': This is a specific type of number in combinatorics, often used in the study of permutations and sequences. It counts the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element.\n    Explanation: The Eulerian number a(n, m) is a way to count permutations of numbers from 1 to n where exactly m elements are greater than the previous element. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the Eulerian number a(n, m) using dynamic programming, we can use the following steps:\n    1. Initialize a 2D array (dp) where dp[i][j] represents the Eulerian number a(i, j).\n    2. Set the base cases:\n        - a(i, 0) = 1 for all i (since there's always exactly one way to arrange i elements with 0 elements greater than the previous one).\n        - a(i, i) = 1 for all i (since there's always exactly one way to arrange i elements with all elements greater than the previous one).\n    3. Fill the dp array using the recursive relation:\n        a(n, m) = (n - m) * a(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * a(n - 1, m)\n    4. Return the value of dp[n][m].\n\n# [edge case] \n    eulerian_num(0, 0) = 1\n    Explanation: By definition, a(0, 0) is 1, as there is exactly one way to arrange 0 elements with 0 elements greater than the previous one (which is the empty permutation).\n    eulerian_num(3, 4) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 4 is greater than 3, it's impossible to have exactly 4 elements greater than the previous one in a permutation of 3 elements. Therefore, the expected output is 0.\n    eulerian_num(2, -1) = 0\n    Explanation: The second argument m must be non-negative, so a(2, -1) is not defined. The expected output is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases since the problem definition and the dynamic programming approach inherently handle cases where n or m are out of bounds or non-sensical. The base cases and the recursive relation ensure that invalid inputs do not produce results.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe Eulerian number a(n, m) counts the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n with exactly m ascents.
