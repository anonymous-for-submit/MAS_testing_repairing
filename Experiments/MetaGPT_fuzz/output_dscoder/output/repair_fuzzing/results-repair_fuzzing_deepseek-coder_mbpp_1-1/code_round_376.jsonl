However, since the digit '1' is repeated three times, it exceeds its value, making the function return `False`.\n\n    validate(0) = True\n    Explanation: The digit '0' appears once, which is equal to its value. Since '0' cannot appear more than once in a non-negative integer, the function correctly returns `True`.\n\n    validate(-123) = False\n    Explanation: The function is designed to handle only non-negative integers. The presence of a negative sign immediately disqualifies the input, and the function should return `False` to indicate invalid input.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case of non-integer inputs.
