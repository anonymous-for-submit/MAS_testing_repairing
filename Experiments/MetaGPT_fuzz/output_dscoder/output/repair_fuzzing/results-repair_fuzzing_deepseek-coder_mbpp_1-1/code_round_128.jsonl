However, to enhance the user experience and make the function more robust, we can consider adding error handling for non-numeric inputs and possibly extending the function to compare more than two values.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function named 'maximum' that takes two arguments and returns the larger one.\n- Implement error handling to manage non-numeric inputs.\n- Extend the function to accept more than two values and return the largest among them.\nWe will implement the 'maximum' function using a simple and robust approach. The function will take two arguments and return the larger one. To enhance robustness, we will include error handling for non-numeric inputs. Additionally, we will consider extending the function to handle more than two values in the future.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'comparison': the core concept is to compare two values and determine which one is larger.\n    Explanation: The requirement is to create a function that takes two inputs and returns the larger of the two. This involves a basic comparison operation.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function should:\n    1. Check if both inputs are numbers.\n    2. Compare the two numbers and return the larger one.\n    3. If either input is not a number, handle the error appropriately.\n\n# [edge case] \n    maximum(5, '10') = Error\n    Explanation: The function should handle non-numeric inputs gracefully. In this case, the second argument is a string, which is not a number, and the function should raise an error or return a specific message indicating the input is invalid.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle non-numeric inputs.\n        if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):\n            raise ValueError(\"Both inputs must be numbers\")\n        return a if a > b else b\n\n    This code checks if both inputs are instances of int or float.
