The function should be easy to use and integrate into existing projects.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to remove characters from the first string that are present in the second string.\n- Ensure the function is case-insensitive, handling both uppercase and lowercase characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance and efficiency.\nTo implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will use Python's built-in string manipulation methods along with the `str.translate` function which is efficient for character removal. This function will create a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each character in the second string to `None`, effectively removing it from the first string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character removal': The core concept involves removing specific characters from a given string based on the presence in another string.\n    Explanation: This requirement focuses on identifying and removing characters from the first string that are found in the second string. This is crucial for cleaning up the first string by eliminating unwanted characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Define the function `remove_dirty_chars` with two parameters: `str1` and `str2`.\n    2. Create a translation table using `str.maketrans` where each character in `str2` is mapped to `None`.\n    3. Use the `str.translate` method on `str1` with the translation table to remove the unwanted characters.\n    4.

This involves checking each substring for the specified condition and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'equal to': means that the sum of the digits in the substring should match its length.\n    Explanation: For example, in the substring '123', the sum of the digits is 6, and the length is 3. If these two values are equal, the substring meets the criteria.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': means that the sum of the digits must exactly match the length of the substring.\n    Explanation: This implies that the sum of the digits should not be greater or less than the length; it must be exactly the same.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `count_Substrings`, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

The function should also be efficient and provide a clear output format for the sorted list.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient in sorting the list of tuples.\n- The function should handle tuples with varying data types.\n- The output should be in a clear and readable format.\n- The function should be tested for different data types to ensure robustness.\n- The user interface should be simple and intuitive.\nWe will use Python's built-in `sorted` function with a custom key argument to sort the list of tuples based on the second value of each tuple. The key argument will be a lambda function that returns the second element of each tuple, which allows the function to handle varying data types by default sorting them according to their type's order.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorting': the process of arranging data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.\n    'varying data types': the function should be able to sort tuples where the second element can be of different data types, such as integers and strings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `subject_marks` using Python's `sorted` function, we can use a lambda function as the key argument to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. The lambda function will extract the second element of each tuple, which allows the sorting to handle varying data types automatically.\n\n# [edge case] \n    subject_marks([('English', '88'), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97), ('Social sciences', 82)]) = [('Social sciences', 82), ('English', '88'), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97)]\n    Explanation:\n    The function should be able to handle tuples with string representations of numbers in the second position. The `sorted` function will convert these strings to integers for comparison, ensuring the correct order.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The `sorted` function in Python is designed to handle various data types and will sort the list of tuples based on the second element correctly.\n"], "test": ["def check(subject_marks):\n\tassert

Define the function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list as an argument.\n    2. Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n    3. Iterate through each element in the list.\n    4. If the element is a list, recursively call `recursive_list_sum` on that element and add the result to the sum.\n    5. If the element is not a list, add it directly to the sum.\n    6. Return the total sum.\n\n# [edge case] \n    recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3, 4], [5, 6]]) = 21\n    Explanation: The function will sum all elements in the list, including those in nested lists. The expected output is the sum of all numbers in the list, which is 21.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic will correctly sum all elements, including those in nested lists.\n"], "test": ["def check(recursive_list_sum):\n\tassert recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]))==21", "def
