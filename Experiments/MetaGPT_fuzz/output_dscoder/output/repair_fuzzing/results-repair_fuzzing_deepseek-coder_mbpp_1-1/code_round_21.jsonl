The function should be able to handle basic inputs like 2 and return the correct Bell number. The product should be efficient and scalable, allowing for larger inputs without performance issues.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate Bell numbers\n- The function should be optimized for performance\n- The function should handle edge cases and errors gracefully\n- The function should be documented and include examples\n- The function should be integrated into a larger project with minimal effort\nTo calculate the Bell number efficiently, we will use a dynamic programming approach. This method is both scalable and performs well for larger inputs.
