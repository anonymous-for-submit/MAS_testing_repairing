This is a classic problem in computer science and can be solved using dynamic programming.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and handle strings of varying lengths.\n- The function should be able to handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings with all identical characters.\n- Implement the function using dynamic programming to ensure optimal performance.\n- Include tests to validate the function's correctness.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for both time and space complexity.\nTo solve the problem of finding the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string, we will use dynamic programming. This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result using a table to store intermediate results, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations.
