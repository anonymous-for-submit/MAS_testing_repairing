It should handle edge cases where elements might be zero. This requirement is clear and specific, aligning well with the goal of creating a functional and robust product.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include the tuple_modulo function.\n- The function should handle tuples of different lengths gracefully.\n- Implement error handling for non-integer elements in the tuples.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance.\n- Include unit tests for the tuple_modulo function.\nWe will implement the tuple_modulo function using Python's built-in capabilities. This function will take two tuples of the same length and perform an element-wise modulo operation. To handle edge cases where elements might be zero, we will include checks to ensure that the function does not attempt to perform a modulo operation with zero, which is undefined.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-wise modulo operation'\n    This means that for each corresponding pair of elements in the two tuples, the modulo operation is performed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `tuple_modulo` function, we will use a loop to iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements, we will check if the second element is zero to avoid division by zero. If not, we will perform the modulo operation and store the result. Here's a detailed implementation:\n\n    ```python\n    def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):\n        result = []\n        for num1, num2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n            if num2 == 0:\n                result.append(0)  # Handle division by zero gracefully\n            else:\n                result.append(num1 % num2)\n        return tuple(result)\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 0, 7, 5)) = (0, 0, 5, 1)\n    Explanation:\n    In this edge case, the second tuple has a zero in the second position. According to the requirement, we should handle division by zero gracefully by returning 0 in such cases.
