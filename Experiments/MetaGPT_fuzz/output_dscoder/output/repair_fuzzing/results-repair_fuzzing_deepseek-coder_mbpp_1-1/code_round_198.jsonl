'find_First_Missing' needs to identify the smallest number not present in a sorted list of natural numbers. This involves checking each number in the sequence to see if it is missing. The function should handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers. Performance is crucial, especially for large sorted lists.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to identify the smallest missing number in a sorted list of natural numbers.\n- Handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers.\n- Optimize performance for large sorted lists.\n- Ensure the function is compatible with various input scenarios.\n- Test the function with a variety of test cases to ensure accuracy.\nTo create a Python function 'find_First_Missing' that identifies the smallest absent number in a sorted list of natural numbers, we will use Python's built-in 'enumerate' function for iteration. This function will iterate through the list and check for the first missing number. We will also handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with negative numbers by adding simple checks at the beginning of the function.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorted list of natural numbers'\n    In the requirement, it means a list where numbers are in ascending order and all elements are non-negative integers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through the list to find the first missing number. This can be done by checking if the index of the current element matches its value. If there's a gap, the missing number is the index after the current element.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_First_Missing([]) = 0\n    Explanation: An empty list means there are no numbers, so the smallest missing number is 0.\n    find_First_Missing([-1, 0, 1, 2]) = 3\n    Explanation: The list contains negative numbers, which are not natural numbers as per the requirement.
