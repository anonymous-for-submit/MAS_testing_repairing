Amicable numbers are pairs of numbers where each number is the sum of the divisors of the other. The function should handle large inputs efficiently and provide clear outputs. Edge cases to consider include very small numbers and invalid inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the sum of amicable numbers.\n- The function should handle large inputs without performance issues.\n- The function should provide clear error messages for invalid inputs.\n- The documentation should be clear and detailed.\n- The function should be tested for edge cases, including very small numbers.\nTo create an efficient function to sum amicable numbers, we will use Python's built-in math library to handle mathematical operations such as finding divisors and checking amicability. We will also use a custom approach to ensure the function can handle large inputs without performance issues. The function will be designed to efficiently compute the sum of amicable numbers up to a specified number, taking into account edge cases such as very small numbers and invalid inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'amicable numbers': numbers where the sum of the proper divisors of each number equals the other number, and vice versa.\n    Explanation: Amicable numbers are pairs of numbers where the sum of the divisors of one number equals the other number, and vice versa. For example, 220 and 284 are amicable numbers because the sum of the divisors of 220 (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110) is 284, and the sum of the divisors of 284 (1, 2, 4, 71, 142) is 220.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the sum of the divisors of a number must be greater than the number itself to be considered for amicability.\n    Explanation: In the context of amicable numbers, the phrase 'more than' is used to ensure that the sum of the divisors of a number is greater than the number itself, as proper divisors do not include the number itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': refers to finding the largest amicable pairs up to a specified number.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb 'largest' indicates that the function should identify the largest amicable pairs within the given range.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function amicable_numbers_sum, we need to:\n    1. Define a function to calculate the sum of divisors of a number.\n    2. Iterate through numbers from 1 to the specified number to find amicable pairs.\n    3. Sum the amicable pairs found.\n    4. Handle edge cases such as numbers less than the sum of their divisors.\n\n# [edge case] \n    amicable_numbers_sum(1) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 1 does not have proper divisors other than 1 itself, it cannot form an amicable pair. Therefore, the sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 1 is 0.\n    amicable_numbers_sum(-5) = \"Invalid input\"\n    Explanation: Negative numbers and zero are invalid inputs for this function as they do not have proper divisors. The function should return an error message indicating invalid input.\n    amicable_numbers_sum(10000) = 31626\n    Explanation: The function should efficiently compute the sum of amicable numbers up to 10,000, which includes pairs like (220, 284), (1184, 1210), and (2620, 2924).
