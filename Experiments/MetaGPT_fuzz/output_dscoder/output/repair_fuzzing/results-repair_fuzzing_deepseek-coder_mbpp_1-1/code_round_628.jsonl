For example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. The highest power of 2 less than or equal to a given number n is the largest number that is a power of 2 and does not exceed n.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n, we can use bit manipulation. The idea is to find the most significant bit (MSB) that is set in the binary representation of n. Once we find the MSB, we can construct the highest power of 2 by shifting 1 left by the position of the MSB.\n\n    Here's the step-by-step logic:\n    1. Initialize a variable to store the result.\n    2. Use a loop to find the MSB of n.\n    3. Set the result to 1, left-shifted by the position of the MSB.\n    4. Return the result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    highest_Power_of_2(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is 1 itself, which is 2^0.\n    highest_Power_of_2(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 0 is not a positive integer, the function should return 0, as there is no power of 2 less than or equal to 0.\n    highest_Power_of_2(15) = 8\n    Explanation: The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 15 is 8, which is 2^3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already correctly handles the edge cases where n is 0 or 1. For other values of n, the logic will find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n efficiently.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a given number n.
