This approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to linear search, making it suitable for large arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorted array': an array where each element is less than or equal to the next one.\n    'last position': the index of the last occurrence of an element in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `last` for finding the last position of an element in a sorted array using binary search:\n    1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n    2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:\n        a. Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n        b. If the element at `mid` is less than or equal to the target element, move `left` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n        c. If the element at `mid` is greater than the target element, move `right` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n        d. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target element, update the result to `mid` and move `left` to `mid + 1` to continue searching the right half for potential later occurrences.\n    3.

Since the search is for the last occurrence, the expected output is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
