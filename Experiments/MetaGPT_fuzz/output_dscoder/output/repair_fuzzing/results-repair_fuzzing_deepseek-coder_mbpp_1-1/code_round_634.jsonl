This operation should be performed element-by-element. The function should handle tuples of different lengths and return the results as a tuple. It should also handle cases where division by zero might occur gracefully.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the division_elements function to handle two tuples and perform element-wise division.\n- Ensure the function returns a tuple with the results of the division.\n- Handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths.\n- Implement error handling for division by zero.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.\nTo implement the 'division_elements' function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle the division operation. The function will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, perform the division, and handle potential errors such as division by zero. We will ensure that the function gracefully handles tuples of different lengths by either truncating the longer tuple or padding the shorter one with ones. Performance optimization will be minimal since Python's built-in operations are already efficient for this type of operation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-by-element division': This involves dividing corresponding elements from two tuples, one at a time.\n    Explanation: This concept requires that we perform a division operation on each pair of elements from the two input tuples. The result should be a new tuple where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `division_elements` function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the lengths of the two tuples are equal. If not, adjust them by truncating the longer tuple or padding the shorter one with ones.\n    2. Iterate through both tuples simultaneously.\n    3. For each pair of elements, perform the division operation.\n    4. Handle any division by zero by checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division. If a zero divisor is encountered, handle it appropriately (e.g., by skipping that element or setting a default value).\n    5. Collect the results in a new tuple.\n    6. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    division_elements((1, 2, 3), (4, 0, 6)) = (0.25, None, 0.5)\n    Explanation: The second tuple has a zero in the second position, causing a division by zero. In this case, we handle the division by zero by returning `None` for that position.\n    division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3)) = (2, 2, 2, 3)\n    Explanation: The first tuple is longer than the second tuple, so we truncate the first tuple to match the length of the second tuple. The result is a tuple where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.\n    division_elements((1, 2, 3), (4, 0, 6, 8)) = (0.25, None, 0.5, 1.125)\n    Explanation: The first tuple is shorter than the second tuple, so we pad the first tuple with ones to match the length of the second tuple. The result is a tuple where each element is the result of the division of the corresponding elements from the input tuples, with the padded values set to 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the tuples are of different lengths. Specifically, we need to adjust the length of the shorter tuple to match the length of the longer tuple.
