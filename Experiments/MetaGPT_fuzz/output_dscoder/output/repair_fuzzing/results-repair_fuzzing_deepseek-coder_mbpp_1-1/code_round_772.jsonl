This method is more efficient for large datasets and provides a better average-case performance compared to simpler sorting algorithms.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the comb_sort function with a variable gap that decreases in value until no swaps are needed.\n- Ensure the function can handle various data types and edge cases.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance, focusing on reducing the number of comparisons and swaps.\n- Provide clear documentation and examples of how to use the comb_sort function.\n- Test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure it is robust and efficient.\nWe will implement the comb_sort function using Python, leveraging the efficiency of the comb sort algorithm for sorting large datasets. The algorithm will use a variable gap that decreases in value until no swaps are needed, ensuring optimal performance. We will also ensure the function can handle various data types and edge cases, providing clear documentation and examples of how to use the comb_sort function.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorting': the process of arranging elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, the core concept is sorting a list of elements. The goal is to arrange the elements in a particular order, which in this case is ascending order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the comb_sort function, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize a variable `gap` with the initial value of the length of the list.\n    2. Create a loop that continues until `gap` is less than or equal to 1 and no swaps are needed.\n    3. In each iteration, reduce the `gap` value.\n    4. Traverse the list and swap elements that are `gap` distance apart if they are out of order.\n    5. Continue the process until the list is sorted.\n\n# [edge case] \n    comb_sort([1]) = [1]\n    Explanation: When the list contains only one element, it is already sorted, so the expected output is the same list.\n    comb_sort([4, 3, 2, 1]) = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    Explanation: This is a typical edge case where the list is in descending order, and the comb_sort function should sort it into ascending order.\n    comb_sort([5, -1, 3, 2]) = [-1, 2, 3, 5]\n    Explanation: The list contains negative numbers and positive numbers. The comb_sort function should be able to handle various data types and sort them correctly.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The comb_sort function can handle single-element lists and lists with negative numbers as long as the elements are comparable.\n"], "test": ["def check(comb_sort):\n\tassert comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25,
