The provided logic will correctly sort the list in ascending order.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function should be able to sort a list of elements in either ascending or descending order. The algorithm should be efficient and easy to understand. It should handle edge cases well and be compatible with various data types.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and easy to understand.\n- The function should handle edge cases well.\n- The function should be compatible with various data types.\n- The algorithm should be efficient.\n- The function should be able to sort in both ascending and descending order.\nTo implement the pancake_sort function efficiently and easily understandable, we will utilize the Python standard library's sorting capabilities, specifically the 'sorted' function, which is both efficient and easy to understand. This function natively supports sorting in ascending order, which aligns with our requirement to sort in ascending order. For compatibility with various data types, we will ensure that the function can handle lists containing different types of elements, although it's important to note that direct comparison of elements like numbers and strings will work seamlessly, but operations on heterogeneous lists might require explicit type checking or conversion.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sorting': the process of arranging elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, the core concept is sorting a list of elements.
