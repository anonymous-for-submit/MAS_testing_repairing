The function should be able to handle tuples with varying levels of nesting, ensuring that all even numbers are identified and returned in a similar nested structure.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a recursive function to traverse through the nested tuple structure\n- Ensure the function can identify and return even numbers\n- Optimize the function for performance and readability\n- Include error handling for non-tuple inputs\n- Add support for nested lists within the tuple structure\nTo implement the function `extract_even` that can extract even numbers from a nested tuple structure, we will use a recursive approach. This approach will allow the function to traverse through the nested tuple structure and identify even numbers regardless of the level of nesting. We will also ensure that the function is optimized for both performance and readability, making it easy to extend and maintain.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'nested tuple': means a tuple that contains other tuples as its elements.\n    'recursive approach': means the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler version of the problem until it reaches a base case.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The function `extract_even` should:\n    1. Check if the current element is a tuple.\n    2. If it is a tuple, recursively call `extract_even` on this tuple.\n    3. If it is not a tuple, check if the element is even.\n    4. If the element is even, include it in the result.\n    5. Return the modified tuple with only even elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    extract_even((1, 3, (5, 7, (9, 11)), 3, 5)) = ((), (), (), (), ())\n    Explanation: Since all elements in the tuple are odd, the function should return a tuple with empty tuples at each level.\n    extract_even((2, 4, (6, 8, (10, 12)), 4, 6)) = ((2, (6, (10, 12)), 4, 6),)\n    Explanation: All elements in the tuple are even, so the function should return a tuple with the original structure but with only even numbers.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
