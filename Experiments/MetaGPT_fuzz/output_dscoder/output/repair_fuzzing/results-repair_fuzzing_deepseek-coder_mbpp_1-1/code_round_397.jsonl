The idea is to use the bitwise AND operation to check if the least significant bit of the number is 1. If it is, we increment our count. Then we right-shift the number by one bit to check the next bit, and repeat the process until the number becomes 0.\n\n    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n    1. Initialize a count variable to 0.\n    2. Use a while loop to iterate until the number becomes 0.\n    3. In each iteration, use the bitwise AND operation to check if the number is odd (i.e., if the least significant bit is 1).\n    4. If the number is odd, increment the count.\n    5. Right-shift the number by one bit.\n    6. Return the count after the loop ends.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_Set_Bits(0) = 0\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 0 is 0, which means there are no set bits.
