This operation should handle edge cases such as empty lists or tuples. The function should also consider the data types involved to ensure the operation is performed correctly.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should handle the addition of lists to tuples.\n- Ensure edge cases like empty lists or tuples are handled.\n- Implement the function to work correctly with different data types.\n- Improve the user interface for better user experience.\nTo implement the 'add_lists' function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle the concatenation of lists and tuples. The function will first check if the input is a list and a tuple, and if both are non-empty. It will then concatenate the list to the end of the tuple and return the result. This approach ensures simplicity and leverages Python's standard library for efficient operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'appending': This involves adding elements from one sequence (like a list) to the end of another sequence (like a tuple).\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to add the elements of a list to the end of a tuple. This operation combines the elements of both sequences into a single sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the 'add_lists' function, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
