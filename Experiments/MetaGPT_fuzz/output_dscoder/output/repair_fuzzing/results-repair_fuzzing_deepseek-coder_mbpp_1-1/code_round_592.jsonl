This can be achieved by using a simple comparison: if the product of the two integers is less than zero, they have opposite signs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: 0 is not considered positive or negative, so the function should return False.\n    opposite_Signs(5, -5) = True\n    Explanation: One integer is positive (5) and the other is negative (-5), so the function should return True.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: One integer is positive (1) and the other is negative (-1), so the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic already correctly handles the case where one of the integers is zero.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that checks if two integers have opposite signs. This is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, including data validation and algorithm design.

This involves using the sign bit of integers to determine their signs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'opposite signs': means that one integer is positive and the other is negative\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `opposite_Signs` function, we can use the XOR operator (`^`). If two integers have opposite signs, their XOR result will be negative (since the sign bit will be set to 1 in the result).\n\n    Here's the logic:\n    1. Take the XOR of the two integers.\n    2. Check if the result is negative.\n    3. Return `True` if the result is negative, otherwise return `False`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    opposite_Signs(0, 5) = False\n    Explanation: The number 0 is neither positive nor negative, so the function should return False.\n    opposite_Signs(5, -5) = True\n    Explanation: The numbers 5 and -5 are of opposite signs, so the function should return True.\n    opposite_Signs(-1, 1) = True\n    Explanation: The numbers -1 and 1 are of opposite signs, so the function should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The XOR operation will naturally return False for the case where either number is 0, as the XOR of 0 with any number is the number itself, which cannot be negative.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that checks if two integers have opposite signs.

The function will take two integers as input and return a boolean value indicating whether they have opposite signs. This can be achieved by checking the sign bit of the integers.
