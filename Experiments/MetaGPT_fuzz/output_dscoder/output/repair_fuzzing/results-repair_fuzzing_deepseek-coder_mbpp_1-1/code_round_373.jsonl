The function should be efficient and handle tuples of various sizes without performance degradation.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code for the find_dissimilar function should accurately compare tuples and return the differing components.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large tuples efficiently.\n- Implement a clear and user-friendly API for easy integration into other projects.\n- Ensure the function is tested thoroughly to handle edge cases and ensure accuracy.\n- Consider providing documentation and examples to help users understand how to use the function effectively.\nTo create the `find_dissimilar` function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities along with the `collections.Counter` class to efficiently compare the elements of the two tuples. The function will compare the counts of each element in both tuples and identify those that are present in only one tuple. This approach ensures both accuracy and efficiency.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'differing components': means the elements that are present in only one of the two tuples.\n    Explanation: The function needs to identify elements that are unique to each tuple, which means they appear in one tuple but not in the other.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `find_dissimilar` function, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in both tuples.\n    2. Compare the counts of each element in both tuples.\n    3. Identify elements that are present in only one tuple.\n    4. Return a tuple containing the elements that are unique to each tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_dissimilar((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)) = ()\n    Explanation: Since both tuples are identical, there are no differing components. The expected output is an empty tuple.\n    find_dissimilar((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3)) = (4,)\n    Explanation: The element 4 is present in the first tuple but not in the second. The expected output is a tuple containing 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle the case where both tuples are identical by returning an empty tuple.\n\n# [code logic] implementation:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    counter1 = Counter(tuple1)\n    counter2 = Counter(tuple2)\n    \n    # Find elements in only one of the tuples\n    unique_elements = []\n    for element in set(tuple1 + tuple2):\n        if counter1[element] != counter2[element]:\n            unique_elements.append(element)\n    \n    return tuple(unique_elements)\n```\n"], "test": ["def
