This is a common task in data manipulation and should be efficiently handled. The function should be optimized for performance and clarity, ensuring it works well with large datasets.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be optimized for performance\n- The function should return the n largest items from the list\n- Ensure the function is easy to understand and use\n- Include error handling for unexpected input\n- Provide documentation and examples for users\nTo create a function that returns the n largest items from a given list efficiently, we will utilize Python's built-in functions and libraries. Specifically, we will use the 'heapq' module which provides an efficient way to find the n largest elements from a collection. This approach is optimized for performance and clarity, making it suitable for handling large datasets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'largest items': means the highest values in the list\n    'n largest items': means the top n highest values in the list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `larg_nnum`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Import the `heapq` module to use its `nlargest` function.\n    2. Define the function `larg_nnum` that takes a list and an integer `n` as arguments.\n    3.
