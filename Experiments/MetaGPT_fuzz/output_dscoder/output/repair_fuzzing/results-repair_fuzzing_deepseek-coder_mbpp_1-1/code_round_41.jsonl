This method involves iterating through possible divisors up to the square root of the given number, which significantly reduces the number of iterations needed for large integers. We will also optimize the divisor counting by taking advantage of the symmetry in divisors, where each divisor less than the square root corresponds to a unique divisor greater than the square root.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'divisors': the total number of integers that divide a given number without leaving a remainder.\n    Explanation: In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n is an integer d that can be multiplied by some other integer to produce n.

For each number, check if it is a divisor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n    4. If it is a divisor, increment the counter.\n    5.
