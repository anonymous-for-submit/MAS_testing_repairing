An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. The function should be efficient and handle arrays of various sizes. The product should also include clear documentation and examples for user understanding.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently calculate the number of inversions.\n- The function should be optimized for large arrays.\n- Include clear documentation and examples.\n- Ensure the function is easy to understand and maintain.\n- Include a simple UI for clear instructions.\nTo create a Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array efficiently, we will use a combination of a brute-force approach and an optimized merge sort approach. The brute-force method will serve as a baseline for correctness, while the merge sort approach will be optimized for handling large arrays.

The idea is to count the number of inversions during the merge process of the merge sort algorithm. Here's the outline of the approach:\n    1. Split the array into two halves.\n    2. Recursively count the inversions in both halves.\n    3. Count the inversions that result from merging the two halves.\n\n    During the merge process, if an element in the right half is smaller than an element in the left half, then it forms an inversion with all the remaining elements in the left half (since the left half is sorted).\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_Inv_Count([1, 3, 2, 4, 5], 5) = 1\n    Explanation: The array [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] has one inversion, which is the pair (1, 2). The element at index 1 (value 3) is greater than the element at index 2 (value 2).\n    get_Inv_Count([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 5) = 10\n    Explanation: The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions. The pairs are (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 1).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic in the plan can handle any size of the array, including the edge case where the array has only one element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. The function should be efficient and handle large arrays effectively. The product should also include clear documentation and examples to assist users.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently calculate the number of inversions.\n- The function should handle large arrays without significant performance degradation.\n- Include clear documentation and examples to help users understand the function.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for performance.\n- Include a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nTo create an efficient Python function that calculates the number of inversions in an array, we will use a combination of a brute-force approach and an optimized merge sort approach. The brute-force method will serve as a baseline for correctness, while the merge sort approach will be optimized for handling large arrays efficiently. We will also include detailed documentation and examples to enhance the user experience.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'inversion': A pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j].\n    Explanation: Inversions are a measure of how unsorted an array is. The more inversions, the more out of order the elements are.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the number of inversions in an array, we can use a brute-force approach or an optimized merge sort approach. The brute-force approach involves checking each pair of indices to see if they form an inversion. The merge sort approach is more efficient as it sorts the array while counting the inversions.\n\n    Brute-force approach:\n    1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of inversions.\n    2. Iterate through each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. Check if array[i] > array[j]. If true, increment the counter.\n    4. Return the counter.\n\n    Optimized merge sort approach:\n    1. Create a helper function to merge two halves of the array while counting the inversions.\n    2. Split the array into two halves.\n    3. Recursively call the merge sort on both halves.\n    4. Merge the two halves and count the inversions during the merge process.\n    5. Return the total number of inversions.\n\n# [edge case] \n    get_Inv_Count([1, 20, 6, 4, 5], 5) = 5\n    Explanation: The inversions are (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), and (1, 4).\n    get_Inv_Count([1, 3, 2, 4, 5], 5) = 1\n    Explanation: The inversion is (1, 2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The brute-force approach will work for small arrays, and the merge sort approach will work efficiently for larger arrays.\n"], "test": ["def check(get_Inv_Count):\n\tassert
