The function should be easy to use and integrate into existing projects.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to remove characters from the first string that are present in the second string.\n- Ensure the function is case-insensitive, handling both uppercase and lowercase characters.\n- Optimize the function for performance and efficiency.\nTo implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will use Python's built-in string manipulation methods along with the `str.translate` function which is efficient for character removal. This function will create a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each character in the second string to `None`, effectively removing it from the first string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'character removal': The core concept involves removing specific characters from a given string based on the presence in another string.\n    Explanation: This requirement focuses on identifying and removing characters from the first string that are found in the second string. This is crucial for cleaning up the first string by eliminating unwanted characters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `remove_dirty_chars`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Define the function `remove_dirty_chars` with two parameters: `str1` and `str2`.\n    2. Create a translation table using `str.maketrans` where each character in `str2` is mapped to `None`.\n    3. Use the `str.translate` method on `str1` with the translation table to remove the unwanted characters.\n    4.
