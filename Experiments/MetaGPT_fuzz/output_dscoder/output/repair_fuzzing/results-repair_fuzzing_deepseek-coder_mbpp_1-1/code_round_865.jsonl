This is a straightforward task that involves basic tuple manipulation and arithmetic operations.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function definition for and_tuples.\n- The function should take two tuples as arguments.\n- The function should return a new tuple with the result of element-wise AND operation.\n- Implement error handling for non-tuple inputs.\n- Include a simple test case in the documentation.\nWe will implement the function `and_tuples` using Python's built-in capabilities. The function will take two tuples as input, perform an element-wise AND operation on their corresponding elements, and return a new tuple with the results. This approach leverages Python's tuple unpacking and the bitwise AND operator to achieve the desired functionality.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-wise operation': This refers to performing the same operation on corresponding elements of two sequences, such as tuples.\n    'AND operation': This is a bitwise operation that results in a bit being set to 1 only if both corresponding bits in the operands are 1.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `and_tuples` function, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples as arguments.\n    2. Use a loop to iterate over the elements of the tuples simultaneously.\n    3. For each pair of elements, perform a bitwise AND operation.\n    4. Collect the results into a new tuple.\n    5.
