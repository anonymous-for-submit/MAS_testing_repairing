This includes handling edge cases such as negative numbers and zero. The function should be efficient and easy to understand. The solution should be robust enough to handle various inputs including large numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be efficient and handle edge cases correctly.\n- The function should be easy to understand and use.\n- The function should handle negative numbers and zero correctly.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- The function should be tested thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\nTo create a function that finds the closest smaller number than a given number n, we will use Python's built-in capabilities. Specifically, we will leverage the `math.floor()` function to find the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, which will help us in handling both positive and negative numbers. For edge cases such as zero and negative numbers, we will add specific checks to ensure the function behaves correctly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'closest smaller number': means finding the largest number that is less than the given number.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to find the nearest integer that is smaller than the input number, taking into account both positive and negative values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `closest_num(n)`, we can use the `math.floor()` function which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

zero and negative numbers as there's no smaller number\n        return math.floor(n)\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    closest_num(0) = None\n    Explanation: Since zero is not a smaller number than itself, and there's no smaller positive number for negative numbers, the function should return `None` for these cases.\n    closest_num(-5) = None\n    Explanation: Similar to zero, there's no smaller number for negative numbers, so the function should return `None`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    def closest_num(n):\n        if n <= 0:\n            return None  # Return None for zero and negative numbers\n        return math.floor(n)\n    ```\n\n    This additional check ensures that the function
