The formula provided is H(n) = n * (2 * n - 1). This can be directly implemented in Python as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def hexagonal_num(n):\n        return n * (2 * n - 1)\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    hexagonal_num(1) = 1\n    Explanation: The first hexagonal number is 1, as calculated by the formula H(1) = 1 * (2 * 1 - 1) = 1.\n    hexagonal_num(2) = 10\n    Explanation: The second hexagonal number is 10, as calculated by the formula H(2) = 2 * (2 * 2 - 1) = 10.\n    hexagonal_num(3) = 27\n    Explanation: The third hexagonal number is 27, as calculated by the formula H(3) = 3 * (2 * 3 - 1) = 27.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the formula directly computes the nth hexagonal number. The edge cases provided (hexagonal_num(1), hexagonal_num(2), and hexagonal_num(3)) are straightforward and fit within the logic of the formula.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. Hexagonal numbers follow a specific sequence where each number can be visualized as a hexagon. The sequence starts with 1 and increases by adding increasing odd numbers. For example, the 1st hexagonal number is 1, the 2nd is 6, the 3rd is 15, and so on. The formula to calculate the nth hexagonal number is n*(2*n-1).\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should include a function hexagonal_num that takes an integer n and returns the nth hexagonal number.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as negative numbers or non-integer inputs.\n- Implement error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.\n- Include a docstring in the function to explain its purpose and usage.\n- Optimize the function for performance, especially for large values of n.\nTo create a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number, we will use a simple and efficient approach.
