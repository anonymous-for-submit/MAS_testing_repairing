We will ensure the function handles large inputs by optimizing the divisor sum calculation and by using efficient iteration.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'amicable numbers': These are pairs of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. Proper divisors of a number are all divisors excluding the number itself.\n    Explanation: For example, 220 and 284 are amicable numbers because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110) is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 (1, 2, 4, 71, 142) is 220.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the sum of proper divisors of a number should be greater than the number itself.\n    Explanation: In the context of amicable numbers, this phrase ensures that we only consider pairs where one number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest possible amicable pairs within a given range.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we are asked to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number, which implies that we should consider the largest possible pairs.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently calculate the sum of amicable numbers, we need to:\n    1.

For each number, check if it has an amicable pair by comparing the sum of its proper divisors to the number itself.\n    4. If an amicable pair is found, add both numbers to a sum.\n    5. Return the final sum of amicable numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    amicable_numbers_sum(1) = 0\n    Explanation: Since 1 has no proper divisors other than itself, it cannot form an amicable pair. Therefore, the sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 1 is 0.\n    amicable_numbers_sum(2) = 0\n    Explanation: The smallest amicable pair is (220, 284), which are greater than 2. Thus, the sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 2 is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
