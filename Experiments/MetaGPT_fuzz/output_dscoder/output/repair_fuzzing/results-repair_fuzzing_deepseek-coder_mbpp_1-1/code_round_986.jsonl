Generate the first `n` even natural numbers.\n    2. Compute the square of each of these even numbers.\n    3. Sum these squares.\n\n    Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n    - Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n    - Use a loop to iterate through the first `n` even numbers.\n    - For each even number, compute its square and add it to the sum.\n    - Return the final sum after the loop completes.\n\n# [edge case] \n    square_Sum(0) = 0\n    Explanation: If `n` is 0, the function should return 0 because there are no even natural numbers to square and sum.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code for this edge case as the logic already handles it by initializing the sum to 0 and returning it immediately if `n` is 0.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a Python function that calculates the sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers.
