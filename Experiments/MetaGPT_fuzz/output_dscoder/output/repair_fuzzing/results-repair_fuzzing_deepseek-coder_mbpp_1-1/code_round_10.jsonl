The perimeter of a square is the total length around its edges.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will take a single argument, the side length of a square, and return the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is calculated as 4 times the side length.\n\n# [edge case] \n    square_perimeter(0) = 0\n    Explanation: A square with a side length of 0 does not exist, as a side length of 0 would mean there is no square. Therefore, the perimeter is 0.\n    square_perimeter(-5) = Error\n    Explanation: A negative side length does not make sense for a square, as a side length cannot be negative. This would be an invalid input, and the function should handle it by raising an error or returning a message indicating the input is invalid.\n    square_perimeter(5.5) = 22.0\n    Explanation: The function should correctly handle floating-point numbers. The perimeter for a square with a side length of 5.5 is 4 * 5.5 = 22.0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if side_length <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Side length must be greater than 0\")\n        return 4 * side_length\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirement is to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length. This is a basic mathematical function that should be simple to implement. The function should take one argument, the side length of the square, and return the perimeter. The example provided (square_perimeter(10)==40) indicates that the function should correctly calculate the perimeter for a given side length.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be simple and efficient.\n- The function should handle integer and floating-point inputs.\n- The function should include error handling for invalid inputs.\n- The function should be documented with a clear description.\n- The function should be tested with various edge cases.\nWe will implement the function `square_perimeter` using a simple and efficient approach. The function will take a single argument, the side length of the square, and return the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is calculated as 4 times the side length. We will ensure the function handles both integer and floating-point inputs and includes error handling for invalid inputs to ensure robustness.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'square': a four-sided polygon with all sides equal in length\n    'perimeter': the total length of the boundary of a two-dimensional shape\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'times': indicates multiplication, in this case, multiplying the side length by 4 to get the perimeter\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb specific to this requirement\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function `square_perimeter` will take one argument, `side_length`, which represents the length of a side of the square. The function will calculate the perimeter by multiplying the `side_length` by 4. The result will be returned as the output of the function.\n\n# [edge case] \n    square_perimeter(0) = 0\n    Explanation: A square with a side length of 0 does not exist, so the perimeter is 0.\n    square_perimeter(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: A square with a negative side length is not possible, so the perimeter is 0.\n    square_perimeter(3.5) = 14.0\n    Explanation: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 3.5 is calculated as 4 times this length, resulting in 14.0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if side_length <= 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n"], "test": ["def check(square_perimeter):\n\tassert square_perimeter(10)==40", "def check(square_perimeter):\n\tassert square_perimeter(5)==20", "def
