The function will handle both positive and negative numbers, including zero. The approach involves checking the floor value of the input number, which will give us the closest smaller integer. For negative numbers, we will use the floor function directly, and for non-negative numbers, we will use the floor function and then check if the result is less than the input number. If the result is equal to the input number, we will return the floor value minus one to ensure it is strictly smaller.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'closest smaller number': means finding the largest number that is smaller than the given number.\n    'edge cases': considering negative numbers, zero, and non-negative numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will use the `math.floor` function to find the closest smaller integer.
