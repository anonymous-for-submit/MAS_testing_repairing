This involves checking if the tuples are of the same length, dividing each corresponding element, and handling any potential division by zero errors. The function should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement division_elements function to handle tuple division element-wise\n- Ensure function can handle tuples of different lengths\n- Add error handling for division by zero\n- Optimize performance for large datasets\n- Include documentation and examples for easy integration\nTo implement the 'division_elements' function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle tuples and perform element-wise division. The function will first check if the input tuples are of the same length. If not, it will handle this gracefully by either truncating the longer tuple or raising an error. For division, we will ensure that we handle cases where a divisor is zero by either skipping that element or handling it according to specific requirements. Performance will be optimized by using list comprehensions and avoiding unnecessary data manipulations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-wise operation': This refers to performing the same mathematical operation on corresponding elements of two sequences, in this case, tuples.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to divide elements from two tuples that are at the same positions.
