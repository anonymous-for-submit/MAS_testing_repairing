This approach is both efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for handling large datasets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'cubes of individual elements': means each number in the list should be raised to the power of 3.\n    Explanation: This involves computing the cube of each number in the list, which can be efficiently done using list comprehensions in Python.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently compute the cubes of individual elements in a list, we can use a list comprehension. This approach is simple and effective for this task.\n\n# [edge case] \n    cube_nums([0]) = [0]\n    Explanation: The cube of 0 is 0. This is an edge case where the list contains a single element that is zero.\n    cube_nums([]) = []\n    Explanation: If the list is empty, the function should return an empty list since there are no elements to cube.\n    cube_nums([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) = [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]\n    Explanation: The function should return the cubes of the absolute values of the negative numbers in the list.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The list comprehension will naturally handle the case of an empty list and the cube of 0.\n"], "test": ["def check(cube_nums):\n\tassert cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 8, 27, 64, 125,
