We'll maintain two variables to keep track of the number of ways to paint the fence up to the current post, considering the constraint that no more than two adjacent posts can have the same color.\n\n    Let's denote:\n    - `same_color` as the number of ways to paint the fence up to the current post with the same color as the previous post.\n    - `diff_color` as the number of ways to paint the fence up to the current post with a different color from the previous post.\n\n    The recurrence relations are:\n    - `same_color[i] = diff_color[i-1]` (since we can only have the same color if the previous two had different colors)\n    - `diff_color[i] = (k-1) * (same_color[i-1] + diff_color[i-1])` (since we can choose any of the `k-1` colors for the current post that is different from the previous post)\n\n    The base cases are:\n    - `same_color[0] = 0` (since the first post cannot have the same color as itself)\n    - `diff_color[0] = k` (since there are `k` choices for the first post)\n\n    The final result will be the sum of `same_color` and `diff_color` for the last post.\n\n# [edge case] \n    count_no_of_ways(1, 3) = 3\n    Explanation: With only one post and three colors, each post can be painted in any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways.\n    count_no_of_ways(0, 5) = 0\n    Explanation: With zero posts, there are no ways to paint the fence, so the output is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The base cases and recurrence relations already cover the edge case of zero posts.\n"], "test": ["def check(count_no_of_ways):\n\tassert count_no_of_ways(2, 4) == 16", "def
