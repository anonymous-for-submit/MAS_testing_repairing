This function should be robust enough to handle lists of different lengths, applying addition to corresponding elements. The function should be efficient and easy to understand, suitable for users with varying levels of programming expertise.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement sum_list function to handle lists of varying lengths.\n- Ensure the function performs element-wise addition accurately.\n- Design an intuitive user interface for the function.\n- Include documentation and examples to aid user understanding.\n- Optimize the function for performance and scalability.\nTo implement the sum_list function, we will use Python's built-in capabilities for handling lists and arithmetic operations. The function will iterate through both input lists, add corresponding elements, and handle cases where the lists are of unequal lengths by simply ignoring the extra elements from the longer list. This approach leverages Python's simplicity and readability, making it accessible even for users with varying levels of programming expertise.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'element-wise addition': This means that we will add corresponding elements from two lists to create a new list.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the function is designed to take two lists and return a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input lists.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will iterate through both input lists, add corresponding elements, and handle cases where the lists are of unequal lengths by simply ignoring the extra elements from the longer list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    sum_list([1,2,3], [4,5]) = [5,7]\n    Explanation: The function will only add the corresponding elements from the two lists, ignoring the extra element in the second list.
