This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or recursion.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should correctly implement the function to calculate the number of sequences.\n- The function should handle edge cases such as when m is less than twice the first element.\n- Implement a user interface to allow users to input values for m and n.\n- Include a results display to show the calculated number of sequences.\n- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.\nTo solve the problem of calculating the number of possible sequences of length 'n' where each element is a positive integer, greater than or equal to twice the previous element, and less than or equal to 'm', we can use dynamic programming. This approach will efficiently compute the number of valid sequences by building up solutions to smaller subproblems.
