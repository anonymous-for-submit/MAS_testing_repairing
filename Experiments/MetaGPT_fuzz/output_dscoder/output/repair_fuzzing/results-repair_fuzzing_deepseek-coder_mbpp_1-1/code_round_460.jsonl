Initializing a shrink factor (usually a value less than 1).\n    2. Calculating the gap between elements to be compared based on the shrink factor.\n    3. Iteratively comparing and swapping elements if they are out of order until the gap becomes 1.\n    4. Using bubble sort to sort the elements when the gap is 1.\n\n# [edge case] \n    comb_sort([1]) = [1]\n    Explanation: When the list has only one element, it is already sorted, so the output is the same list.\n    comb_sort([7, 7, 7, 7]) = [7, 7, 7, 7]\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so the sorted list remains the same.\n    comb_sort([34, 8, 50, 21, 76]) = [8, 21, 34, 50, 76]\n    Explanation: This is a general case where the list is sorted using the comb_sort algorithm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The comb_sort algorithm inherently handles lists with a single element or lists with all identical elements correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe comb_sort algorithm is an improvement over bubble sort and has a better average-case time complexity of O(n log n). It aims to reduce the number of comparisons and swaps by using a larger gap between compared elements in the initial stages of sorting. The function should handle various types of input data, including numbers, strings, and custom objects, ensuring flexibility and robustness.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the comb_sort algorithm with a customizable gap sequence.\n- Ensure the function can handle different data types for sorting.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance, especially for large datasets.\n- Include documentation and examples to help users understand how to use the comb_sort function.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\nWe will implement the comb_sort algorithm using Python, leveraging the efficiency and readability of the language. The comb_sort algorithm is an improvement over bubble sort and has a better average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
