This approach ensures the function is both simple and efficient.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'regular pentagon': a polygon with five equal sides and five equal angles.\n    'perimeter': the total distance around the edge of a shape.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we need to multiply the length of one side by 5, since all sides are equal.\n\n# [edge case] \n    perimeter_pentagon(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since a regular pentagon cannot have a side of length 0, the perimeter should also be 0.\n    perimeter_pentagon(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Negative lengths are not valid for the sides of a pentagon, so the perimeter should be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if side_length <= 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive number': means that the input will always be a number greater than 0.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we need to multiply the length of one side by 5, since all sides are equal.\n\n# [edge case] \n    perimeter_pentagon(0) = 0\n    Explanation: Since a regular pentagon cannot have a side of length 0, the perimeter should also be 0.\n    perimeter_pentagon(-5) = 0\n    Explanation: Negative lengths are not valid for the sides of a pentagon, so the perimeter should be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if side_length <= 0:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one side.
