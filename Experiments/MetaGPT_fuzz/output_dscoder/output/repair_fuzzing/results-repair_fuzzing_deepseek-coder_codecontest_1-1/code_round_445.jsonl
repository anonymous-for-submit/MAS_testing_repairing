The solution will involve managing an array dynamically based on the queries provided. We will use a list to represent the array, which will be modified according to the query types. For efficient replacement operations, we will use the `list.replace()` method, which is straightforward and built-in. We will also handle edge cases such as an empty array or a non-existent element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array management': the ability to add elements and modify elements in an array based on given queries.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing an array that can grow dynamically as new elements are added and modified according to specific rules. This includes adding elements to the end of the array and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates the presence of a condition where an element must be present in the array for replacement.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" is used to specify that the element to be replaced (x) must exist in the array before the replacement operation can occur.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as there are no degree adverbs directly related to the size or extent of the array or its elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to represent the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Performing a replacement operation on an empty array.\n    Edge case 2: Attempting to replace an element that does not exist in the array.\n    Edge case 3: Adding a large number of elements to the array, potentially testing performance.\n\n    Edge case 1 = []\n    Explanation: If a replacement operation is attempted on an empty array, the result should be an empty array since there are no elements to replace.\n\n    Edge case 2 = [1, 2, 3], x = 4, y = 5\n    Explanation: If we attempt to replace an element (x) that does not exist in the array, the array should remain unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 3 = [1] * 10^6, x = 1, y = 2\n    Explanation: Adding a large number of elements (10^6) to the array and attempting a replacement operation could test the performance and efficiency of the code, especially if the replacement operation is not optimized.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not arr:\n            if query_type == '2':\n                return arr  # No operation can be performed on an empty array.\n        if x not in arr:\n            return arr  # No replacement if x is not found in the array.\n\n    # Additional code to handle large inputs and edge cases efficiently.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 445, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
