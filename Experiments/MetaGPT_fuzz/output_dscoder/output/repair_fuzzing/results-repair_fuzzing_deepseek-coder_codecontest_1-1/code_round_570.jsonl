The output should be a list of integers representing the final state of the array after all queries have been processed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms to handle array append and replace operations.\n- Ensure the program can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries and elements efficiently.\n- Provide a clear and concise output format for the final array state.\n- Implement error handling to manage unexpected inputs or conditions gracefully.\n- Optimize the user interface for ease of use and understanding of the program's functionality.\nTo efficiently handle the queries, we will use a Python list to store the elements, which allows for quick append operations. For the replace operation, we will iterate through the list to find and replace all occurrences of the specified element. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that the operations are optimized for performance, especially with large datasets and numerous queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding and replacing elements in a list based on given queries.\n    'performance optimization': ensuring efficient handling of large datasets and numerous queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': used to indicate that an element should be replaced if it appears in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not relate to the operations described.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    - Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output:\n    1 2 1\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - The fourth query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output:\n    1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is empty.\n    - After the second query, the array is [1].\n    - After the third query, the array is [1, 4].\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [1, 4, 2].\n    - The fifth query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in [1, 4, 4].\n    - The sixth query replaces all occurrences of 4 with 3, resulting in [1, 3, 3].\n    - After the seventh query, the array is [1, 3, 3, 2].\n    - The eighth query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 7, resulting in [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
