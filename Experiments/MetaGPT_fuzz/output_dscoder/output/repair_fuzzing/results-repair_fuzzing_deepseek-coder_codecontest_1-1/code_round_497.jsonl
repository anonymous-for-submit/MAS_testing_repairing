{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of indices to check if removing those elements results in the remaining elements having the same mean. We will optimize this by avoiding unnecessary calculations and leveraging set operations for quick lookups.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': the average of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that removing the elements at these indices results in the remaining elements having the same mean as the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly two elements': means we need to remove two specific elements from the array.\n    Explanation: We need to identify pairs of indices [i, j] where i < j, and removing the elements at these indices will not affect the mean of the remaining elements.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'exactly': means we need to find pairs of indices that meet the condition without any deviation.\n    Explanation: We need to ensure that the mean of the remaining elements after removing two specific elements is exactly the same as the original mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement this, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Therefore, the expected output is 0.\n\n    Edge case 2: Array where all elements are the same.\n    search([5, 5, 5]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, removing any two elements will not change the mean. There are three possible pairs: [0, 1], [0, 2], and [1, 2].\n\n    Edge case 3: Array where no pair can maintain the mean.\n    search([1, 2, 3]) = 0\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is 2, and no pair of elements can be removed to maintain this mean. Therefore, the expected output is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has fewer than three elements.\n    def search(lst):\n        if len(lst) < 3:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n\n    This additional code checks the length of the array and returns 0 if the array has fewer than three elements, as no valid pairs can be formed.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 497, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 408}
