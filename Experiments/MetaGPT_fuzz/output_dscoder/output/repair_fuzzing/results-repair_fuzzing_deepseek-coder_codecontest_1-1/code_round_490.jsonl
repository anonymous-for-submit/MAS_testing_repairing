{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Clarify how the initial hand position affects the calculation if it is not aligned with the start of the word. Consider the keyboard layout and initial hand positioning to ensure accurate time calculation. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The task is to calculate the time required to type a given word on this keyboard, considering the time taken to move the hand between keys.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'consecutively': Indicates that letters in the word are typed one after another without skipping any.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one,\" the phrase 'consecutively' means that the letters in the word must be typed in the order they appear, without skipping any.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Indicates the smallest or lowest value among a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard,\" the degree adverb 'minimal' specifies that we need to find the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Create a dictionary to map each key on the keyboard to its position.\n    2. For each test case, calculate the total time to type the word by summing the absolute differences in positions between consecutive letters.\n    3. Output the total time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [5, 5, 4, 4, 4]. The number 4 appears three times, which is more than its value, but the largest number 5 appears three times as well. Since no single number appears more than or equal to itself, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where no integer appears more than or equal to itself.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time to type a word based on the keyboard layout, which involves determining the positions of each letter on the keyboard and calculating the time based on the absolute difference in positions between consecutive letters. The input includes multiple test cases, each with a different keyboard layout and word to be typed. The output should provide the total time for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on the keyboard layout.\n- Handle multiple test cases with different keyboard layouts and words.\n- Ensure the program is efficient and can handle up to 1000 test cases.\n- Allow for customization of keyboard layouts to suit different user preferences.\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time to type a word based on the given keyboard layout.

For example, \"appears more than itself\" means the integer appears at least twice.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates the greatest or biggest value in a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"largest integer\" refers to the integer with the highest value that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1.

Sum the times for all letters in the word to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that appear more than once. The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears 3 times.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than once, but the largest integer that meets the condition is 3, as it appears 3 times.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The integers 2, 3, and 4 all appear more than once, but none of them appear at least as many times as themselves. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
