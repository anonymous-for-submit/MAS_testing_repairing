This means we need to find the indices where the element is equal to its index and count them. The goal is to maximize this count by removing zero or more elements from the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find indices where the element is greater than its index.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find indices where the element is equal to its index.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the maximum value of f(a) by considering various sequences after removing elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the sequence and for each element, check if it equals its index. We will keep track of the maximum count of such indices we can achieve by removing elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5\n    Explanation: In this case, every element is already equal to its index, so no elements need to be removed. The largest possible f(a) is 5.\n    search([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation: In this case, only the element at index 1 (value 5) is equal to its index. Removing any other element will not increase the count. The largest possible f(a) is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
