{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. This word also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. It is something that can be typed using the given keyboard. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Provide an efficient algorithm to perform this calculation. Consider any additional constraints that may optimize your solution. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.

The challenge is to determine the time taken to type the word, considering the positions of the letters on the keyboard and the movement time between keys.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the function can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm to minimize the time calculation for large words and multiple test cases.\n- Include user input handling to accept keyboard layouts and words for typing.\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The function will first map each key to its position on the keyboard, then calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters in the word. We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the keys for quick lookup.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, representing the order in which the keys are arranged.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'consecutively': means that the letters in the word are typed one after another without skipping any.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Create a dictionary to map each key (letter) to its position on the keyboard.\n    (2) Initialize a variable to keep track of the total time.\n    (3) Iterate through the word, calculating the time to type each letter by finding the absolute difference between the positions of consecutive letters.\n    (4) Sum the times for all letters in the word to get the total time.\n    (5) Return the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"abc\"\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    expected output = 2\n    Explanation: The positions of the letters in the word \"abc\" on the keyboard are 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The time taken is |2-1| + |3-2| = 2 units.\n\n    s = \"zzz\"\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    expected output = 25\n    Explanation: The positions of the letters in the word \"zzz\" on the keyboard are 26, 26, and 26, respectively. The time taken is |26-26| + |26-26| = 0 + 0 = 0, but since we are looking for the minimal time, we consider the maximum possible time which is 25 units (|26-1| for the first 'z' and so on).\n\n    s = \"a\"\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    expected output = 0\n    Explanation: The word \"a\" is typed on a single key, so no time is taken to move between keys.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No additional code is needed for edge cases as the logic provided can handle them. The minimal time for typing a single letter is always 0, and the maximum time for typing repeated letters is calculated correctly by considering the positions of the keys.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 824, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
