Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

Now he wants to finish the first stage of this game. A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp's character starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete the level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nInput:\n- The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n- Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n- The first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n- The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n- Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput:\n- For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n[plan]\n- We will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game mechanics.\n- The game will be designed using Python, leveraging the Pygame library for handling graphics and user interactions.\n- The game will be a 2D grid-based puzzle where the player navigates through the grid to reach the end without falling into traps.\n- The game will be designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'grid-based puzzle': The game is structured as a 2D grid with specific movement rules.\n    Explanation: The player must navigate through a grid where each cell can be either safe or contain a trap. The goal is to move from the start (cell (1, 1)) to the end (cell (2, n)) without dying.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship found in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb found in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the game logic, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the end is found. We will also need to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them, which could lead to infinite loops.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: n = 3, level = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns and all cells safe, the character can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, level = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The character can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4), avoiding the traps in cells (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, level = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The character is trapped from the start, as moving right from (1, 1) leads to a trap, and moving down from (1, 1) does not change the situation. The character cannot reach the end without falling into a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    The core logic of the BFS algorithm already handles edge cases effectively. The BFS ensures that all possible paths are explored, and since the start and end cells are safe, the algorithm will naturally avoid traps unless there is no way to reach the end without falling into one. Therefore, no extra code is needed for handling edge cases beyond the core BFS implementation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum).

Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.

another computer game, where his character has to kill a dragon, and the battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start, and the dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger); however, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13.

This approach will be efficient and capable of handling the large input sizes specified in the problem.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary search': This is a technique used to find the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a given condition.

For each test case, apply the binary search to determine the minimum k.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 1 1\n           [1]\n    Explanation: There is only one attack, and the damage needed is 1. The minimum k is 1 because the attack is at the beginning of the first second.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 2 3\n           [1, 3]\n    Explanation: There are two attacks, and the damage needed is 3. The minimum k is 2 because the attacks are at the beginning of the 1st and 3rd seconds, and the poison effect will last for at least 2 seconds to deal 3 damage.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the binary search approach inherently handles cases where the number of attacks is very large.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a Python function to implement the binary search approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_deal_damage(k, attacks, h):\n        damage = 0\n        last_attack_time = 0\n        for attack_time in attacks:\n            duration = attack_time - last_attack_time\n            damage += (duration + k - 1) // k  # Ceiling division to calculate the number of times the poison effect is updated\n            last_attack_time = attack_time\n        return damage >= h\n\n    def find_min_k(n, h, attacks):\n        left, right = 1, 10**18  # Set initial bounds for binary search\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if can_deal_damage(mid, attacks, h):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n\n    # Read input and process each test case\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, h = map(int, input().split())\n        attacks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        print(find_min_k(n, h, attacks))\n    ```\n\n    This code defines a function `can_deal_damage` to check if a given k results in at least h damage being dealt. The `find_min_k` function performs a binary search to find the minimum k. For each test case, it reads the input, applies the binary search, and prints the result.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe project requires a main function that reads input from stdin, processes the data to find the minimum k value for each test case, and outputs the result to stdout.

The binary search will be used to efficiently find the smallest k that ensures Monocarp deals at least h damage to the dragon. We will sort the attack times and then use a function to calculate the total damage caused by a given k. This approach will ensure we efficiently find the minimum k without having to test every possible value of k.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary search': This is a method used to find the minimum value of k efficiently by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n    'damage calculation': This involves summing up the damage dealt by each attack considering the duration of the poison effect (k seconds).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least': Indicates that the total damage must be equal to or greater than h.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum possible': Refers to the smallest value of k that still ensures Monocarp deals at least h damage.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Increasing k to 6 will ensure the total damage is at least 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the attacks are very close together, requiring a large k to ensure the total damage is at least h.

This involves identifying the three integers that could have produced the given sums when combined in all possible ways. The solution must be efficient to handle the constraints of the problem, including the potential for a large number of test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to restore the original array from the given sums.\n- Ensure the solution can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs without performance issues.\nTo restore the original array from the given sums, we need to identify the three integers that could have produced the given sums. This involves recognizing that the sums are the combinations of the three integers, and we can use combinatorial properties to deduce the original array. We will use Python's itertools to generate all possible combinations of the sums and then match them with the given sums to identify the original integers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'non-empty subsequences': means all possible combinations of the elements in the array, including single elements and multiple elements.\n    'sorted in non-decreasing order': means the sums are arranged from smallest to largest.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'all non-empty subsequences': means we need to consider all possible combinations of the elements in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'sorted': means the result should be in ascending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To restore the array a, we need to:\n    1.

Sort the identified integers to form the original array a.\n\n# [edge case] \n    b = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8]\n    explanation: The given sums are the combinations of three integers. We need to find the original integers that produce these sums. The smallest sum is 1, the next is 3, and the largest is 8. These sums correspond to the original integers 1, 3, and 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The given sums uniquely identify the original integers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a Python function to restore the array a:\n\n    ```python\n    from itertools import combinations\n\n    def restore_array(b):\n        for a in combinations(b, 3):\n            if sum(a) == b[0]:\n                return sorted(a)\n\n    # Example usage:\n    b = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8]\n    restored_array = restore_array(b)\n    print(restored_array)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n    ```\n\n    This function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three elements from the list `b`. It then checks if the sum of the combination equals the smallest element in `b`, which is the first element of the sorted sums. If it does, it returns the sorted combination as the restored array `a`.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": false, "pass": false, "pass_num": 0, "round": 18, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line which contains 7 integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_7 (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9; b_i \u2264 b_{i+1}). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one array a which yields this array b as described in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print 3 integers \u2014 a_1, a_2 and a_3.

The operations involve binary representation, string manipulation, and conversion between decimal and binary.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the binary operation as described.\n- Ensure the solution can handle large numbers up to 10^{18}.\n- Provide a clear output YES or NO based on the transformation possibility.\n- Optimize the solution for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Include detailed documentation and comments for easy understanding.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the binary operations and large number handling efficiently. The key steps involve converting numbers to binary, performing the specified operations, and converting back to decimal to check if we can reach the target number.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary operations': This involves converting numbers to their binary representation, performing specific manipulations, and converting back to decimal to check for a specific condition.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to manipulate the binary representation of a number by appending '0' or '1' and then reversing it to check if we can reach a target number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the given integers x and y to their binary representations.\n    2. Perform the specified operations on x to potentially reach y.\n    3. Check if the resulting number in decimal form is equal to y.\n    4. If we can reach y, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The number 3 appears 3 times, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 3 is the largest number with this property, the function returns 3.\n\n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) = 2\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. The number 2 appears 2 times, which is equal to its value. The number 4 appears once, which is less than its value. The number 3 appears once, which is less than its value. The number 1 appears twice, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 2 is the largest number with this property, the function returns 2.\n\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [5, 5, 4, 4, 4]. The number 4 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value. However, the number 5 appears twice, which is also more than or equal to its value. Since there is no single largest number that meets the condition, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

"Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to finish the first stage of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level by carefully navigating through the grid.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The pivot element is the last element of the array in this context.\n    Explanation: The eversion operation is a specific way to rearrange the elements of an array based on a chosen pivot. The goal is to split the array into two parts where the left part contains elements not greater than the pivot, and the right part contains elements strictly greater than the pivot. This operation is repeated until the array stops changing, indicating that no more eversions can occur.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find elements in the array that are strictly greater than the pivot.\n    Explanation: In the context of the eversion operation, 'more than' is used to define the elements that will be placed in the right part of the array after partitioning. These elements are greater than the pivot but less than or equal to the maximum value in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we are looking for the largest element in the array to use as the pivot for partitioning.\n    Explanation: The 'largest' degree adverb is used to identify the element that will be placed at the end of the array after partitioning.

This means that the numbers are effectively x * 10^p.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'zeros appended': means that the number is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of p.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the biggest number.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to compare two numbers where one is a positive integer x with p zeros appended to its end, and the other is the same integer but with p zeros appended to its end. The 'largest' degree adverb is not directly applicable here, but the concept of comparing the numbers after removing the trailing zeros is important.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we need to compare the numbers after removing the trailing zeros. This can be done by counting the number of trailing zeros in each number and then comparing the remaining numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: x_1 = 1, p_1 = 1000000\n    Expected output: '<'\n    Explanation: When x_1 is 1 and p_1 is 1000000, the first number becomes 1 followed by 1000000 zeros, which is a very large number. The second number, being 1 followed by 1000000 zeros, is even larger. Therefore, the first number is smaller than the second one.\n\n    Edge case 2: x_1 = 2, p_1 = 0, x_2 = 2, p_2 = 0\n    Expected output: '='\n    Explanation: Both numbers are the same after removing the trailing zeros. Both are simply 2.\n\n    Edge case 3: x_1 = 3, p_1 = 0, x_2 = 1, p_2 = 1000000\n    Expected output: '>'\n    Explanation: The first number is 3, and the second number, after removing the trailing zeros, is 1. Therefore, the first number is greater than the second one.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic to compare the numbers after removing the trailing zeros is sufficient to solve the problem.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a need to compare two numbers where each number has a specific number of zeros appended to it. The comparison should consider edge cases, such as when x is 1 and p is very large. The solution should be efficient and handle a large number of test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to compare two numbers with zeros appended to them.\n- Handle edge cases where x is 1 and p is very large.\n- Optimize the code for performance to handle a large number of test cases.\n- Ensure the solution provides clear and accurate comparison results.\nTo implement the solution, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to compare two large numbers where zeros are appended to one of them. We will use string manipulation to handle the zeros and then compare the resulting numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'large numbers': The requirement involves comparing two numbers, where one number has a specific number of zeros appended to it. This requires handling very large integers that cannot be directly compared due to their size.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is dealing with large numbers that are represented as strings with appended zeros, which need to be compared accurately.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'p zeros appended to its end': This phrase indicates that the number of zeros to be appended is a significant factor in the comparison.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"p zeros appended to its end\" means that the number is effectively multiplied by 10^p. For example, if x = 5 and p = 3, the number becomes 5000.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'very large': This adverb indicates that the value of p can be exceptionally large, which affects the size of the number when zeros are appended.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb \"very large\" refers to the fact that the value of p can be very high, making the difference in size between the two numbers significant.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Read the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read the two numbers and the number of zeros to be appended.\n    3. Append the zeros to the numbers.\n    4. Compare the two resulting numbers and print the appropriate comparison result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: x_1 = 1, p_1 = 10^6\n    Expected output: '<'\n    Explanation: When x_1 = 1 and p_1 = 10^6, the first number becomes 1 followed by 10^6 zeros, which is a very large number. The second number, being just x_2, is significantly smaller.\n\n    Edge case 2: x_1 = 10^6, p_1 = 0, x_2 = 10^6, p_2 = 0\n    Expected output: '='\n    Explanation: Both numbers are the same (10^6) with no zeros appended. Therefore, they are equal.\n\n    Edge case 3: x_1 = 1, p_1 = 0, x_2 = 2, p_2 = 0\n    Expected output: '<'\n    Explanation: The first number is 1, and the second number is 2. Regardless of the zeros, 1 is smaller than 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where x is 1 and p is very large, or when p is 0.\n    For edge case 1:\n        if x_1 == 1:\n            return '<'\n    For edge case 2 and 3:\n        (No extra code needed as the main logic handles these cases correctly)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve comparing two numbers where each number is followed by a certain number of zeros.

It is guaranteed that T is a permutation of the string abc. Find string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'. A permutation of string b is also a permutation of string a if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings. String a is a permutation of string b if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings. A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a string S (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100), consisting of lowercase English letters. The second line of each test case contains a string T that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence, |T| = 3). Note that there is no limit on the sum of |S| across all test cases. Output For each test case, output a single string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will use a combination of Python's built-in libraries and external libraries to generate permutations efficiently and check for subsequences.

We will ensure that the solution is optimized for performance by using efficient algorithms and data structures.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'lexicographically smallest permutation': This refers to the arrangement of characters in a string where the characters are sorted in alphabetical order, with the smallest character first.\n    Explanation: In the context of permutations, finding the lexicographically smallest permutation means arranging the characters of the string in such a way that the resulting string is the earliest in the dictionary order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Generate all permutations of the string S.\n    2. Check if the string T is a subsequence of each permutation.\n    3. Return the first permutation where T is not a subsequence.\n\n# [edge case] \n    test_case1:\n        S = \"cba\"\n        T = \"abc\"\n        expected_output = \"acb\"\n        Explanation: The permutations of \"cba\" are [\"cba\", \"cab\", \"bca\", \"bac\", \"acb\", \"abc\"]. Among these, \"acb\" is the lexicographically smallest permutation where \"abc\" is not a subsequence.\n\n    test_case2:\n        S = \"zzz\"\n        T = \"abc\"\n        expected_output = \"acz\"\n        Explanation: The permutations of \"zzz\" are [\"zzz\"]. Since \"abc\" is not a subsequence of \"zzz\", the output is \"acz\", which is the lexicographically smallest permutation of \"zzz\" that does not contain \"abc\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan should be sufficient to generate the required permutation.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 39, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not. If the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. For the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test. Your task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively. The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get. This is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 {0, 1}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise. The sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput For each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n[plan]\nTo maximize the surprise value of the test results, we need to find a permutation of points for each question that maximizes the sum of the absolute differences between the expected and actual points for each student.
