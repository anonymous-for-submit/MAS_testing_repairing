{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears 3 times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The list is [3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]. The integers 2, 3, and 4 appear 1, 2, and 3 times respectively. None of them appear at least as many times as themselves, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating a system that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 lowercase letters, and the word to be typed is also provided as a string of lowercase letters. The challenge is to determine the position of each letter on the keyboard and calculate the total time based on the order of typing each letter.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on a given keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the system can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Allow users to input their own keyboard layouts for customization.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\n- Implement a feature to analyze and compare typing speeds across different keyboard layouts.\nTo solve this problem, we will implement a Python function that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The function will first map each letter to its position on the keyboard, then calculate the time based on the order of typing each letter. We will use a simple and efficient approach to handle the input and output efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique letter from 'a' to 'z'.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 characters, each representing a key on the keyboard. The order of these characters determines the position of each letter on the keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of times a letter appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the phrase 'appears at least as many times' refers to the frequency of an integer in a list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the maximum or greatest value among a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the degree adverb 'largest' specifies that we need to find the largest integer with the given property.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter in the word to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the time taken to type each letter based on its position.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The number 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 3 is the largest number with this property, the function returns 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the input list might be empty or contain only one element.\n        if not lst:\n            return -1\n        if len(lst) == 1:\n            return lst[0]\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the time taken to type a word on a given keyboard based on the positions of the keys. The keyboard layout is fixed, and the word consists of lowercase Latin letters. The challenge lies in calculating the time for each letter's position change and summing them up. Assumptions include that the keyboard layout does not change during the operation, and the word length is between 1 and 50 letters.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on keyboard positions.\n- Ensure the function handles different keyboard layouts and word lengths.\n- Optimize the function for efficiency to handle up to 1000 test cases.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs such as non-lowercase letters in the word.\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specified keyboard. The function will map each letter to its position on the keyboard and then calculate the total time based on the positions of consecutive letters. We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the keys for quick lookup.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the keys are arranged sequentially in one row.\n    'letter positions': Each letter is assigned a position from 'a' to 'z' based on its order in the keyboard.\n    'time calculation': The time to type a letter is the absolute value of the difference between the positions of the current and previous letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    (2) Initialize a variable to keep track of the total time.\n    (3) Iterate through the word, calculating the time to type each letter based on its position and the position of the previous letter.\n    (4) Return the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    calculateTime(\"abc\", [1, 2, 3]) = 2\n    Explanation: The word \"abc\" is typed on a keyboard where 'a' is at position 1, 'b' at position 2, and 'c' at position 3.
