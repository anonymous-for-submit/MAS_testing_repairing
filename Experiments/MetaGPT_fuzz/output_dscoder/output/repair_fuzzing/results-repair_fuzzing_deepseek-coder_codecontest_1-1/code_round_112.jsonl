{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The goal is to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, N). The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, and some cells are traps which block movement.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'adjacent cells': These are cells that are next to each other horizontally or vertically.\n    Explanation: In the grid, moving from one cell to an adjacent cell means changing either the row or the column by 1 unit.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'simple and efficient': This describes the approach used to solve the problem, indicating a straightforward method that is also computationally efficient.\n    Explanation: The approach uses Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The BFS algorithm will be used to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, N). The algorithm will keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them and ensure that only safe cells are considered for movement.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3, grid = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns, the character can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, grid = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: Despite some traps, there is a path that avoids all traps and reaches (2, 4).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, grid = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: There is no way to reach (2, 4) without landing on a trap, as the traps block the only possible path.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS algorithm inherently handles edge cases such as starting and ending at safe cells, and it will naturally avoid paths that include traps.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game is a 2xN grid where Monocarp starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, N). The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner. The goal is to determine if reaching the end is possible given some cells are traps. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a safe starting and ending cell. The output should indicate if it's possible to complete the level for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game mechanics accurately\n- Ensure the game is responsive and engaging\n- Include a beautiful UI for better user experience\n- Allow user to choose difficulty levels\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The game mechanics involve checking the path from the start to the end of the grid, considering the traps. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and determine if a path exists. The BFS will help us explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring we find the shortest path if one exists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': The core concept involves navigating a 2xN grid, starting from (1, 1) and ending at (2, N), considering certain cells as traps.\n    Explanation: The player must move through the grid, avoiding traps, to reach the end. The grid is a matrix with two rows and N columns. The goal is to determine if there's a path from the start to the end without landing on any trap cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid. Here's a detailed logic:\n    1. Read the input for each test case, including the number of columns and the grid layout.\n    2. Initialize a BFS queue with the starting position (1, 1).\n    3. Use a visited set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n    4. Explore adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n    5. If a cell is out of bounds or is a trap, skip it.\n    6. If the end cell (2, N) is reached, return \"YES\".\n    7. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the end, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Test case:\n    ```\n    3\n    3\n    010\n    100\n    ```\n    Expected output: \"YES\"\n    Explanation: The grid is small enough that a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without hitting any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Test case:\n    ```\n    1\n    4\n    0110\n    1001\n    ```\n    Expected output: \"NO\"\n    Explanation: There's a trap at (1, 2) and (2, 3), blocking the path to (2, 4).\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Test case:\n    ```\n    2\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    ```\n    Expected output: \"YES\"\n    Explanation: The grid is entirely safe, so reaching the end is trivially possible.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS logic inherently handles cases where the grid is entirely safe or where the end is blocked by traps. The BFS will terminate early if no path exists, and it will find a path if one does exist.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.
