The user stories highlight the importance of a user-friendly interface and clear output.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output for the final array.\n- Ensure the system is user-friendly and compatible with a wide range of devices.\nTo efficiently handle the dynamic queries on an array of integers, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for storing the array elements. For each query, we will implement the logic to either append an element or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element. We will ensure that the operations are performed efficiently to meet the performance requirements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic queries': the ability to add or modify elements in a list based on given instructions.\n    Explanation: In this scenario, the list is initially empty and will be modified multiple times according to the queries provided.
