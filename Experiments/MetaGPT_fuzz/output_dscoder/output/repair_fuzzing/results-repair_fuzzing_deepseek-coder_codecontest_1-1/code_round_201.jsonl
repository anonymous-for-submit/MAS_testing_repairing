{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves iterating through all pairs and checking the condition, which can be computationally expensive for large arrays. The solution must be efficient and handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check the condition.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the output is accurate and matches the expected result for all test cases.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in libraries and data structures. The main challenge is to iterate through all pairs of positions and check the condition efficiently, especially given the upper limits of the input constraints. We will use a brute-force approach initially to ensure correctness, followed by optimizations to handle large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The mean of an array is calculated by summing all the elements and then dividing by the number of elements. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3], the mean is (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': indicates that the frequency of an element should be at least equal to its value.\n    Explanation: For instance, if we have an array [2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the number 3 appears three times, which is more than its value, but 2 appears only twice, which is less than its value. Therefore, 3 is the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': refers to finding the greatest integer in the array that meets a certain condition.\n    Explanation: In the example search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]), the number 3 is the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) in the array.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at positions i and j.\n    4. Check if the new mean is equal to the original mean.\n    5.

We will use a brute-force approach initially to ensure correctness and then optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The mean of an array is calculated by summing all the elements and then dividing by the number of elements. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the mean is (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    Explanation: For example, \"more than\" can be used to compare the mean of the remaining elements after deletion with the original mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': indicates that two quantities are the same.\n    Explanation: For example, \"equal to\" can be used to compare the mean of the remaining elements after deletion with the original mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) in the array and check if deleting the elements at these positions results in the remaining elements having the same mean as the original array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, it's impossible to delete two elements and still have the remaining mean equal to the original mean.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, array = [4, 4, 4, 4]\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so deleting any two elements will result in the mean of the remaining two elements being equal to the original mean. There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose two elements to delete.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n = 3.\n        if n == 3:\n            return 0\n\n    For the general case, the provided plan already includes a brute-force approach to iterate through all pairs of positions and check the condition.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 201, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 11}
