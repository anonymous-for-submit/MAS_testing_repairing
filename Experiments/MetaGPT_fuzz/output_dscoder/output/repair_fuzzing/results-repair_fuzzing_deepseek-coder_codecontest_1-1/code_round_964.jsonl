{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

This layout is used to determine the position of each character in the word that needs to be typed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the word can be typed using the provided keyboard layout.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the word 's' can be typed using the given keyboard layout, which means we need to consider the positions of each character in the word on the keyboard.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest amount of time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the minimal time required to type the word 's' on the given keyboard layout, which involves calculating the distance between consecutive characters on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through each character in the word and finding its position on the keyboard. The time taken to type each character will be the distance from the current position to the position of the character in the keyboard layout.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that are more than zero and appear at least as many times as the integer itself. The largest integer that meets this condition is 3, as it appears three times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Here, the list contains integers that are more than zero, but no integer appears at least as many times as itself. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
