For the replacement operation, we will iterate through the list to find and replace all occurrences of a specified element. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that the application can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries, so we will focus on optimizing for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements with others.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    'at least as many times': means the same or more occurrences of an element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': refers to the biggest or greatest element in a set.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - For each query of type \"1 x\", append 'x' to the array.\n    - For each query of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    1\n    1 1\n    Output:\n    1\n    Explanation:\n    There is only one query of the first type, so the resulting array is simply [1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    2\n    2 1 2\n    1 1\n    Output:\n    2 1\n    Explanation:\n    The first query is of type \"2 1 2\", so we replace all occurrences of 1 with 2 in the array, resulting in [2, 2].\n    The second query is of type \"1 1\", so we add 1 to the end of the array, resulting in [2, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    3\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output:\n    2 3 3\n    Explanation:\n    The first two queries add 1 and 2 to the array, resulting in [1, 2].\n    The third query replaces all occurrences of 1 with 3, resulting in [2, 3, 3].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge case)\n    - Ensure that the array is initialized before processing any queries.\n    - Handle the case where the array is empty and the first query is of type \"2 x y\".\n    - Ensure that the replacement operation correctly handles cases where 'x' is not present in the array.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 143, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
