{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

However, I can help you analyze the first two prompts based on the criteria you provided. Let's proceed with the analysis for the first two prompts.\n\n## Analysis for Prompt 1:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'overlapping': This refers to the ability to count substrings that overlap, meaning a part of the substring can be part of another occurrence.\n    Explanation: This concept is important because it affects how we search for the substring within the original string. Overlapping occurrences mean that if a part of the substring matches, it should be counted again if the next character is also part of the substring.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests a detailed approach to solving the problem:\n    1. Get the input string and substring from the user.\n    2. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of occurrences.\n    3. Iterate through the original string using a sliding window approach.\n    4. Check if the current substring matches the input substring.\n    5. If a match is found, increment the counter variable.\n    6. Return the final count of occurrences.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: An empty substring appears four times in the original string 'abc'. The method 'count' in Python counts the non-overlapping occurrences of a substring, so it would return 2 for 'abc' and ''. However, considering overlapping occurrences, the correct count is 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case where the substring is empty:\n    if not string:\n        return 0\n    elif not substring:\n        return len(string) + 1\n    (other code)\n\n## Analysis for Prompt 2:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive integers': All numbers in the list are greater than zero.\n    Explanation: This is important because the function should only consider numbers that are positive to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n    'at least as many times': A number appears 'at least as many times' as itself if its frequency is greater than or equal to its value.\n    Explanation: This concept is crucial for determining if a number meets the criteria of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find an integer whose frequency is more than its value.\n    Explanation: This phrase helps in filtering out numbers that do not meet the criteria.\n\n    'at least as many times': This phrase indicates that we need to find an integer whose frequency is at least equal to its value.\n    Explanation: This phrase is used to ensure that we find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the given condition.\n    Explanation: This is important for returning the highest number that satisfies the criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests a detailed approach to solving the problem:\n    1.

Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    4. Return the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their values, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
