We will use a list to store the sequence and a set to keep track of indices that have been checked.

If an element does not satisfy the condition `a_i = i`, it is removed from the sequence.

This approach will be supported by efficient data structures to handle the large input sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'fixed points': An element in the sequence is considered a fixed point if its value is equal to its index. For example, in the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the element at index 2 is 3, which is not equal to its index, so it is not a fixed point.\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the maximum number of elements in the sequence that are equal to their indices after potentially deleting some elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find elements whose value is greater than their index.\n    Explanation: For example, in the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the element 4 is not a fixed point because 4 is not equal to its index 1.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the maximum number of fixed points after deletions.\n    Explanation: The goal is to maximize the number of fixed points by deleting elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can follow these steps:\n    1.
