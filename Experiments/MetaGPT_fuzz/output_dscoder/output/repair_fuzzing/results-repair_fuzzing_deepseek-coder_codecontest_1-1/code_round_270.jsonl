Finally, replacing all 1s with 3 results in [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding 1, 2, and 1, it becomes [1, 2, 1]. Replacing all 2s with 2 results in [1, 2, 1], which remains unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After changing all 1s to 4, it becomes [4]. Adding 1, 4, and 2 makes it [4, 1, 4, 2]. Changing all 4s to 3 results in [3, 1, 3, 2]. Adding 2 makes it [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]. Changing all 2s to 7 results in [3, 1, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
