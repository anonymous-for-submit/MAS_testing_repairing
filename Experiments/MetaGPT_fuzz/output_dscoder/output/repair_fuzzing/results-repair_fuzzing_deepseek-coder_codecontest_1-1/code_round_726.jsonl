This is a common task in programming where dynamic data structures are used to store and modify data.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find integers whose count is greater than or equal to their value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the largest integer in a list.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value, and it is the largest number that meets this condition.\n    search([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The number 1 appears twice, which is not more than or equal to its value, and no other number appears more than or equal to itself. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can directly compare each number with its count to find the largest number that meets the condition.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a need for a dynamic array that can handle two types of operations: adding elements and replacing elements.

For efficient handling of large numbers of queries, we will ensure that the operations are optimized for performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements to an array and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manage a dynamic array and perform specific operations on it, such as adding elements and replacing certain values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': means that the replacement should occur for every instance of the specified element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the operations described.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    - Iterate through each query.\n    - For query type \"1 x\": Append the element x to the end of the array.\n    - For query type \"2 x y\": Replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    - Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = \"1 100000\"\n    expected output = [100000]\n    Explanation: This is a simple addition to the array, and the order is maintained as expected.\n\n    query = \"2 1 2\"\n    expected output = [2]\n    Explanation: The only element in the array is replaced, and the resulting array contains only the new value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic already covers the addition of a single element and the replacement of an element with another.\n\nPlease note that the edge cases provided are simplistic and may not fully cover the complexity of the operations described in the requirement. More comprehensive edge cases would need to be considered to ensure robustness.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 726, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
