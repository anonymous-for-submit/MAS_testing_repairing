Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

Now he wants to finish the first stage of this game. A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp's character starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete the level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nInput:\n- The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n- Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n- The first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n- The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n- Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput:\n- For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n[plan]\n- We will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game mechanics.\n- The game will be designed using Python, leveraging the Pygame library for handling graphics and user interactions.\n- The game will be a 2D grid-based puzzle where the player navigates through the grid to reach the end without falling into traps.\n- The game will be designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'grid-based puzzle': The game is structured as a 2D grid with specific movement rules.\n    Explanation: The player must navigate through a grid where each cell can be either safe or contain a trap. The goal is to move from the start (cell (1, 1)) to the end (cell (2, n)) without dying.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship found in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb found in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the game logic, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the end is found. We will also need to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them, which could lead to infinite loops.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: n = 3, level = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns and all cells safe, the character can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, level = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The character can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4), avoiding the traps in cells (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, level = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The character is trapped from the start, as moving right from (1, 1) leads to a trap, and moving down from (1, 1) does not change the situation. The character cannot reach the end without falling into a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    The core logic of the BFS algorithm already handles edge cases effectively. The BFS ensures that all possible paths are explored, and since the start and end cells are safe, the algorithm will naturally avoid traps unless there is no way to reach the end without falling into one. Therefore, no extra code is needed for handling edge cases beyond the core BFS implementation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum).

Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.

another computer game, where his character has to kill a dragon, and the battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start, and the dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger); however, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13.

This approach will be efficient and capable of handling the large input sizes specified in the problem.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary search': This is a technique used to find the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a given condition.

For each test case, apply the binary search to determine the minimum k.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 1 1\n           [1]\n    Explanation: There is only one attack, and the damage needed is 1. The minimum k is 1 because the attack is at the beginning of the first second.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 2 3\n           [1, 3]\n    Explanation: There are two attacks, and the damage needed is 3. The minimum k is 2 because the attacks are at the beginning of the 1st and 3rd seconds, and the poison effect will last for at least 2 seconds to deal 3 damage.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the binary search approach inherently handles cases where the number of attacks is very large.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a Python function to implement the binary search approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_deal_damage(k, attacks, h):\n        damage = 0\n        last_attack_time = 0\n        for attack_time in attacks:\n            duration = attack_time - last_attack_time\n            damage += (duration + k - 1) // k  # Ceiling division to calculate the number of times the poison effect is updated\n            last_attack_time = attack_time\n        return damage >= h\n\n    def find_min_k(n, h, attacks):\n        left, right = 1, 10**18  # Set initial bounds for binary search\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if can_deal_damage(mid, attacks, h):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n\n    # Read input and process each test case\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, h = map(int, input().split())\n        attacks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        print(find_min_k(n, h, attacks))\n    ```\n\n    This code defines a function `can_deal_damage` to check if a given k results in at least h damage being dealt. The `find_min_k` function performs a binary search to find the minimum k. For each test case, it reads the input, applies the binary search, and prints the result.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe project requires a main function that reads input from stdin, processes the data to find the minimum k value for each test case, and outputs the result to stdout.

The binary search will be used to efficiently find the smallest k that ensures Monocarp deals at least h damage to the dragon. We will sort the attack times and then use a function to calculate the total damage caused by a given k. This approach will ensure we efficiently find the minimum k without having to test every possible value of k.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary search': This is a method used to find the minimum value of k efficiently by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n    'damage calculation': This involves summing up the damage dealt by each attack considering the duration of the poison effect (k seconds).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least': Indicates that the total damage must be equal to or greater than h.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum possible': Refers to the smallest value of k that still ensures Monocarp deals at least h damage.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Increasing k to 6 will ensure the total damage is at least 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the attacks are very close together, requiring a large k to ensure the total damage is at least h.

This involves identifying the three integers that could have produced the given sums when combined in all possible ways. The solution must be efficient to handle the constraints of the problem, including the potential for a large number of test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to restore the original array from the given sums.\n- Ensure the solution can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs without performance issues.\nTo restore the original array from the given sums, we need to identify the three integers that could have produced the given sums. This involves recognizing that the sums are the combinations of the three integers, and we can use combinatorial properties to deduce the original array. We will use Python's itertools to generate all possible combinations of the sums and then match them with the given sums to identify the original integers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'non-empty subsequences': means all possible combinations of the elements in the array, including single elements and multiple elements.\n    'sorted in non-decreasing order': means the sums are arranged from smallest to largest.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'all non-empty subsequences': means we need to consider all possible combinations of the elements in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'sorted': means the result should be in ascending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To restore the array a, we need to:\n    1.

Sort the identified integers to form the original array a.\n\n# [edge case] \n    b = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8]\n    explanation: The given sums are the combinations of three integers. We need to find the original integers that produce these sums. The smallest sum is 1, the next is 3, and the largest is 8. These sums correspond to the original integers 1, 3, and 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The given sums uniquely identify the original integers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a Python function to restore the array a:\n\n    ```python\n    from itertools import combinations\n\n    def restore_array(b):\n        for a in combinations(b, 3):\n            if sum(a) == b[0]:\n                return sorted(a)\n\n    # Example usage:\n    b = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8]\n    restored_array = restore_array(b)\n    print(restored_array)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n    ```\n\n    This function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three elements from the list `b`. It then checks if the sum of the combination equals the smallest element in `b`, which is the first element of the sorted sums. If it does, it returns the sorted combination as the restored array `a`.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": false, "pass": false, "pass_num": 0, "round": 18, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line which contains 7 integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_7 (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9; b_i \u2264 b_{i+1}). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one array a which yields this array b as described in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print 3 integers \u2014 a_1, a_2 and a_3.

The operations involve binary representation, string manipulation, and conversion between decimal and binary.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the binary operation as described.\n- Ensure the solution can handle large numbers up to 10^{18}.\n- Provide a clear output YES or NO based on the transformation possibility.\n- Optimize the solution for performance to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Include detailed documentation and comments for easy understanding.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the binary operations and large number handling efficiently. The key steps involve converting numbers to binary, performing the specified operations, and converting back to decimal to check if we can reach the target number.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary operations': This involves converting numbers to their binary representation, performing specific manipulations, and converting back to decimal to check for a specific condition.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to manipulate the binary representation of a number by appending '0' or '1' and then reversing it to check if we can reach a target number.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Convert the given integers x and y to their binary representations.\n    2. Perform the specified operations on x to potentially reach y.\n    3. Check if the resulting number in decimal form is equal to y.\n    4. If we can reach y, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The number 3 appears 3 times, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 3 is the largest number with this property, the function returns 3.\n\n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) = 2\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. The number 2 appears 2 times, which is equal to its value. The number 4 appears once, which is less than its value. The number 3 appears once, which is less than its value. The number 1 appears twice, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 2 is the largest number with this property, the function returns 2.\n\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [5, 5, 4, 4, 4]. The number 4 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value. However, the number 5 appears twice, which is also more than or equal to its value. Since there is no single largest number that meets the condition, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
