{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This maintains the mean k.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 5, array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: The mean k is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3. Possible pairs that maintain the mean k are [0, 1], [0, 2], and [1, 2].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can be used to solve all cases, including the edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then iterating through pairs to check if their deletion maintains the mean. The challenge lies in optimizing this for large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check if their deletion maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs within the given constraints.\n- Ensure the output is accurate and matches the expected result for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array once and then iterating through all pairs of positions to check if deleting the elements at these positions results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. We will optimize this by avoiding recalculating the mean for each pair, which would be computationally expensive.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in a set.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find the mean of the array and then determine how many pairs of elements can be removed such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs where removing two elements results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates that we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) in the array.\n    3. Check if removing the elements at positions i and j results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 3, a = [1, 2, 3]\n    expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, it's impossible to remove any two elements and still have the mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.\n\n    n = 4, a = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+6)/4 = 3. Removing the elements at positions 1 and 3 (0-indexed) results in the remaining elements [2, 3] with a mean of (2+3)/2 = 2.5, which is not equal to 3. No other pairs result in the same mean.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n = 3, as explained above.\n        if n == 3:\n            return 0\n\n    This code checks if the number of elements is exactly 3 and returns 0 if true, as no pairs can be removed to maintain the original mean.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 471, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 385}
