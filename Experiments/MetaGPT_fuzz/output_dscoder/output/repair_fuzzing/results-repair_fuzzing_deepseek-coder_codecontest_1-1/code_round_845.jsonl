{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each key corresponds to a specific letter, and the order of the keys determines the position of each letter.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of occurrences of a particular letter in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" it means that if a number appears more than or equal to its value, it meets the condition.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Refers to the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: This adverb indicates that we need to find the minimum time needed to type the word, considering the movement between keys.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the function, we need to:\n    1. Map the positions of the keys on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the time taken to type each letter, considering the movement between keys.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters in the word to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that appear more than or equal to their value. The largest integer that meets this condition is 3, which appears three times.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their value, but the largest integer that meets the condition is 3.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the integers appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can determine if no integer meets the condition and return -1 accordingly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time to type a word based on the positions of letters on a keyboard.
