Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\nIn total, it takes 39 energy.\n\nIn the second query, the illusion rate of the 1-st room changes from 10 to -3.\n\nIn the third query, their

Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

Now he wants to finish the first stage of this game. A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp's character starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete the level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nInput:\n- The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n- Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n- The first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n- The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n- Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput:\n- For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n[plan]\n- We will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game mechanics.\n- The game will be designed using Python, leveraging the Pygame library for handling graphics and user interactions.\n- The game will be a 2D grid-based puzzle where the player navigates through the grid to reach the end without falling into traps.\n- The game will be designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'grid-based puzzle': The game is structured as a 2D grid with specific movement rules.\n    Explanation: The player must navigate through a grid where each cell can be either safe or contain a trap. The goal is to move from the start (cell (1, 1)) to the end (cell (2, n)) without dying.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship found in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb found in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the game logic, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the end is found. We will also need to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them, which could lead to infinite loops.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: n = 3, level = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns and all cells safe, the character can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, level = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The character can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4), avoiding the traps in cells (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, level = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The character is trapped from the start, as moving right from (1, 1) leads to a trap, and moving down from (1, 1) does not change the situation. The character cannot reach the end without falling into a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    The core logic of the BFS algorithm already handles edge cases effectively. The BFS ensures that all possible paths are explored, and since the start and end cells are safe, the algorithm will naturally avoid traps unless there is no way to reach the end without falling into one. Therefore, no extra code is needed for handling edge cases beyond the core BFS implementation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.
