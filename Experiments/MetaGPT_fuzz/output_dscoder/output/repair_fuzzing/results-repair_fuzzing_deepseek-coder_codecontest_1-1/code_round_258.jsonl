The operation adds a new element to the end of the array, and the system should correctly handle this without errors.\n\n    query_type = \"2\" and x = 1, y = 10^6\n    expected output = [10^6, 1, 1, ..., 1] (10^6 ones)\n    Explanation:\n    This edge case tests the system's ability to replace all occurrences of a specific element with another element, especially when dealing with a large number of elements. The system should efficiently replace all instances of the element without any performance issues.\n\n    query_type = \"1\" and x = 1\n    expected output = [1, 1, ..., 1] (10^5 ones)\n    Explanation:\n    This edge case checks the system's ability to handle a large number of elements efficiently. The operation adds a new element to the end of the array multiple times, and the system should maintain performance without significant slowdowns.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
