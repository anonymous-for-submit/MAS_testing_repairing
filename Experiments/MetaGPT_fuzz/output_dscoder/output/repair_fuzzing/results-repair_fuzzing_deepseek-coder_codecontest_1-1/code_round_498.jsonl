{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves iterating through all possible pairs and checking if deleting them results in the same mean. The constraints are high, requiring the solution to be efficient and handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check if deleting them results in the same mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution provides clear and accurate output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in data structures and libraries. The main challenge is to iterate through all possible pairs of positions in the array and check if deleting them results in the same mean. We will use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of the differences between elements and the target mean. This will help us avoid recalculating the mean for each pair, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': The average value of a set of numbers. In this case, the mean of the array elements.\n    Explanation: The mathematical mean (average) of an array is calculated by summing all the elements and dividing by the number of elements. Monocarp wants to delete two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of times an element appears should be greater than or equal to the element itself.\n    Explanation: For example, if an element is 3, it should appear at least 3 times in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    Explanation: We need to find the largest integer in the array that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the original mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] in the array.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean of the remaining elements.\n    4. Check if the new mean is equal to the original mean.\n    5. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3]) = 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, there are no pairs to delete, so the expected output is 0.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation: The pairs [0, 2] and [1, 3] can be deleted to maintain the original mean.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
