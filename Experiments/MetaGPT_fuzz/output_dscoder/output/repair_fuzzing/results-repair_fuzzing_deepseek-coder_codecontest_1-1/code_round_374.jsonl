{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves a straightforward calculation for the mean and a nested loop to check each pair of indices. The constraints are such that the input size can be large, so the solution must be efficient to handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Calculate the mean of the array\n- Find pairs of indices whose removal does not change the mean\n- Ensure efficiency in handling large inputs\n- Provide clear and concise output\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair checking. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all possible pairs of indices to check if their removal maintains the mean. This approach leverages Python's ability to handle large datasets efficiently due to its optimized data structures and built-in functions.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mean (average) of an array is calculated by summing all the elements and then dividing by the total number of elements. Monocarp wants to delete two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains the same as the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the value must be greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': means that the frequency of an element must be at least a certain value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': refers to the element with the highest value.\n    'greatest': similar to 'largest', but often used to emphasize the highest degree or quality.\n    'shortest': refers to the shortest length or duration.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve the problem, we need to:\n    1.

The main challenge is to handle large inputs efficiently, so we will focus on optimizing the algorithm for time complexity. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through the array to find pairs of positions [i, j] that, when deleted, maintain the mean. We will use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of the differences between the elements and the mean, which simplifies the calculation of pairs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    'pairs of positions': combinations of two distinct positions in an array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly two elements': we need to remove two specific elements from the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': the remaining elements after deletion should have the same mean as the original array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 3, a = [1, 2, 3]\n    expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, it's impossible to delete two and still have the remaining elements' mean equal to the original mean.\n\n    n = 4, a = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+6)/4 = 3. Deleting the elements at positions 1 and 3 (0-indexed) leaves [2, 3], which also has a mean of 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n < 3, as it's impossible to delete two elements to maintain the mean.\n        if n < 3:\n            return 0\n\n    (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 374, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 265}
