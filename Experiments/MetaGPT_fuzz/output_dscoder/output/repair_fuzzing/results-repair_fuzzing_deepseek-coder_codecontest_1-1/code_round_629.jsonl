Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2, 6) = [1, 6, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: In this edge case, we replace all occurrences of the value 2 with 6 in the array. The resulting array is [1, 6, 3, 4, 5].\n\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 2], 2, 4) = [1, 4, 4, 3, 4]\n    Explanation: We replace all occurrences of the value 2 with 4 in the array. The resulting array is [1, 4, 4, 3, 4].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the value to be replaced is not present in the array.\n        if x not in arr:\n            return arr  # or handle the case as needed\n\n    This extra code ensures that we do not attempt to replace a value that is not present in the array, which could lead to errors.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a need for a system that can manage an array with dynamic queries. The system must be able to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently, which implies a need for optimized algorithms and data structures. The system should also be able to handle a variety of inputs, including integers up to 5 * 10^5, and should provide clear and concise output reflecting the state of the array after all queries are processed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle array operations.\n- Ensure the system can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output reflecting the state of the array after all queries are processed.\n- Allow users to append numbers to an initially empty array.\n- Allow users to replace specific numbers in the array with another number.\nTo efficiently handle the dynamic queries on an initially empty array, we will use a Python list to store the elements. For the substitution queries, we will use a dictionary to keep track of the replacements. This approach allows us to handle the array modifications efficiently while maintaining simplicity and clarity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': handling dynamic changes to an array, specifically appending and substituting elements.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing an array that starts empty and undergoes multiple operations, including adding elements and replacing specific values. This necessitates a flexible and efficient approach to handle the operations in sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates the presence of a condition where a value must be greater than a specified amount.\n    'at least as many times': suggests a requirement where a value must appear a minimum number of times.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': refers to finding the biggest value in a set of values.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to represent the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query:\n        - For \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n        - For \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    3. Return the final state of the array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n    expected output = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n    Explanation:\n    The edge case involves a series of operations where elements are repeatedly added and substituted. The final array should reflect the last substitution operations, showing the final state after all queries are processed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        def process_queries(queries):\n            array = []\n            for query in queries:\n                if query[0] == 1:\n                    array.append(query[1])\n                elif query[0] == 2:\n                    x, y = query[1], query[2]\n                    array = [y if elem == x else elem for elem in array]\n            return array\n\n    This code handles the edge case by dynamically updating the array based on the substitution queries, ensuring that all occurrences of the specified element are replaced with the new value.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 629, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
