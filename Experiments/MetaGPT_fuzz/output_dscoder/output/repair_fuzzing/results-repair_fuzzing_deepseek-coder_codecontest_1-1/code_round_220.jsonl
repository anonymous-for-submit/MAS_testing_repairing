{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

This approach is efficient and leverages the fact that the sequence of special numbers can be represented in a similar way to how binary numbers represent integers. Each digit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of n, and the sum of the digits (interpreted as binary) gives the special number.

So, the 2nd special number is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The given logic is efficient and handles small values of n and k directly. However, for very large values of n or k, optimizations or different approaches might be necessary to ensure efficiency.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to find the k-th special number in a sequence that consists of numbers which can be expressed as sums of different non-negative powers of n. The solution must be efficient to handle large values of n and k, and the output must be given modulo 10^9+7 to prevent overflow. The problem involves understanding the properties of numbers and their representations, which can be approached using mathematical properties and bit manipulation techniques.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an efficient algorithm to find the k-th special number.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for time and space complexity.\n- Handle edge cases where n or k are extremely large.\n- Output the result modulo 10^9+7 to prevent overflow.\n- Ensure the user interface is simple and intuitive.\nTo solve the problem of finding the k-th special number in a sequence that consists of numbers which can be expressed as sums of different non-negative powers of n, we will use a mathematical approach based on the properties of numbers and bit manipulation. The sequence of special numbers can be represented as sums of distinct non-negative powers of n, which can be mapped to binary representations. This allows us to leverage bitwise operations to generate the k-th special number efficiently. The solution will be optimized for both time and space complexity to handle large values of n and k.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': a number that can be expressed as a sum of different non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: In this problem, a special number is defined as a number that can be represented as the sum of distinct non-negative powers of a base number n. For example, if n = 4, then 17 is a special number because it can be expressed as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the k-th special number in a sequence of numbers that can be expressed as sums of different non-negative powers of n, we can use a bit manipulation approach. The idea is to represent k in its binary form and use the bits to determine which powers of n to sum up. This approach is efficient because it leverages the properties of binary representation to generate the k-th special number.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 2, k = 1\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: When n = 2, the sequence of special numbers includes all numbers that can be expressed as sums of different non-negative powers of 2. The first special number is 2^0 = 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 3, k = 4\n    Expected output: 13\n    Explanation: When n = 3, the sequence of special numbers includes numbers like 3^0, 3^1, 3^0 + 3^1, 3^2, etc. The fourth special number in increasing order is 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 10^9, k = 10^9\n    Expected output: 1099511627776\n    Explanation: When n is very large, the k-th special number will also be large. The output should be the k-th special number modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where k is very large.
