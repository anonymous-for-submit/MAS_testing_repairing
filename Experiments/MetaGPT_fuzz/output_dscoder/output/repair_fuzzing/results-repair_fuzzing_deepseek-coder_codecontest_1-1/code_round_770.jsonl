{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each letter has a specific position, and the time to type a letter is determined by the absolute difference in positions between consecutive letters. The challenge is to optimize the traversal of the keyboard layout for maximum efficiency.

The function will first map each letter to its position on the keyboard, then iterate through the word to calculate the total time based on the absolute difference in positions between consecutive letters. We will handle edge cases such as an empty word or a single letter word by returning 0 as the total time.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key represents a unique letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, each representing a key on the keyboard. The goal is to calculate the time to type a word based on the positions of these letters on the keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of times a letter appears in the word should be greater than or equal to the letter's position on the keyboard.\n    Explanation: For example, if a letter 'a' appears more than or equal to 1 time in the word, it means 'a' must appear at least once in the word.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': Refers to the minimum time required to type the word, considering the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n    Explanation: The smallest time will be when the word is typed with the least possible movement between consecutive letters, which is achieved by typing the word in order of the keyboard's arrangement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

The number 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value, and it is the largest number that meets this condition.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears once, the number 3 appears twice, and the number 4 appears three times. None of these numbers appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
