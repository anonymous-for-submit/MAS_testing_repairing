{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The project aims to provide a practical application for users to evaluate their typing speed and efficiency on different keyboards.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on keyboard layout.\n- Allow the input of multiple test cases to evaluate different keyboards and words.\n- Output the minimal time required to type each word for each test case.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting keyboard layouts and words.\n- Ensure the application is efficient and can handle a large number of test cases.\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard. The function will take into account the positions of each letter on the keyboard and compute the sum of the absolute differences in positions between consecutive letters in the word. We will use a simple and efficient approach to ensure the application is both user-friendly and efficient.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard is represented as a string of 26 unique lowercase Latin letters, and each letter is associated with a specific position or key number from 1 to 26.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the frequency of an integer in the list must be greater than or equal to the integer itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the list [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1], the integer 2 appears more than or equal to 2 times.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the function should return the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n    Explanation: For instance, in the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan involves:\n    1.

Iterating through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    4. Returning the result or -1 if no such integer exists.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) = 2\n    Explanation: The integer 2 appears more than or equal to 2 times, and it is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The integer 3 appears more than or equal to 3 times, and it is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: No integer appears more than or equal to itself. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
