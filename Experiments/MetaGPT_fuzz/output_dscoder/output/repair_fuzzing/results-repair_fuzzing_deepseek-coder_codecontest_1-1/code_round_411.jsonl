The first type of query adds an element to the end of the array, and the second type replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another element. The system must be able to handle a large number of queries efficiently, ensuring that the final array is output correctly. Edge cases such as no changes to the array after a series of operations must also be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final array after all queries have been executed.\n- Consider edge cases where the array might remain unchanged after a series of operations.\nTo efficiently handle the dynamic queries on an initially empty array of integers, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for storing the array elements. For managing the queries, we will implement a function that processes each query according to its type. The function will dynamically update the array based on the query instructions. We will ensure that the function can handle a large number of queries efficiently by avoiding unnecessary operations and leveraging Python's efficient list handling capabilities.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic queries', 'array manipulation'\n    In the requirement, we have a series of operations to perform on an initially empty array.
