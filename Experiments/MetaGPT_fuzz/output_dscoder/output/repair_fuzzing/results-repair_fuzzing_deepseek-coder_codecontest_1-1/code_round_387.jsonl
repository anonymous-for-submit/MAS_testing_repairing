We will iterate through the sequence and for each element, decide whether to keep it or remove it based on the potential increase in f(a).\n\n    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n    1. Initialize a list `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0.\n    2. Iterate through the sequence from index 0 to n-1.\n    3. For each element, check if it is beneficial to remove it or keep it.\n    4. Update the `dp` array accordingly.\n    5. The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: n = 4, a = [4, 2, 3, 1]\n    Explanation: The sequence already has f(a) = 2, and no elements need to be removed.
