{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [edge case] \n    lst = [1]\n    expected output = 1\n    Explanation: If the list contains only one element, that element is the largest and appears exactly once, so it meets the condition.\n\n    lst = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n    expected output = 3\n    Explanation: The number 3 appears three times, which is more than its value, and it is the largest number in the list that meets the condition.\n\n    lst = [3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]\n    expected output = -1\n    Explanation: Numbers 2 and 4 appear less than their values, and there is no number that appears as many times as itself. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan can handle lists with a single element or multiple elements that do not meet the condition.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'sliding window': A technique where a subset of data is processed at a time, typically by moving a fixed-size window across the data.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the sliding window is used to check for occurrences of the substring within the original string, allowing for overlapping instances.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates the minimum frequency a number must appear to be considered.\n    Explanation: For example, if a number must appear more than once to be considered, it means the number must appear at least twice in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'overlapping': Refers to the allowance of overlapping instances of the substring within the original string.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that overlapping instances should be included in the count, meaning the substring can appear multiple times within the same window of the original string.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Identify the length of the original string and the substring.\n    2. Iterate through the original string using a sliding window approach.\n    3. Check if the current substring matches the input substring.\n    4. If a match is found, increment the counter variable.\n    5. Return the final count of occurrences.\n\n# [edge case] \n    string = \"\"\n    substring = \"a\"\n    expected output = 0\n    Explanation: If the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n\n    string = \"abc\"\n    substring = \"\"\n    expected output = 4\n    Explanation: An empty substring appears four times in the original string \"abc\". The count method would return 4 for an empty string in a non-empty string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 915, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
