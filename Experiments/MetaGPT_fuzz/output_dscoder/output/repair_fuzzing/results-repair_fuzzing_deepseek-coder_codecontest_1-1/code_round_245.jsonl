{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner, and it is clearly prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells, and if Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.

Despite the presence of traps, there is a path that avoids all traps and reaches the destination safely.\n    search([4, 0111, 1110]) = NO\n    Explanation: This grid is also 2x4 with the top row being '0111' and the bottom row being '1110'. The character starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). There are traps blocking the path, making it impossible for the character to reach the destination without triggering a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS algorithm inherently checks all possible paths, and the given constraints ensure that the character starts and ends on safe cells. The algorithm will naturally avoid paths with traps and determine if a path exists.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the constraints and conditions given in the problem statement. The character starts at (1, 1) and must move to (2, N) avoiding traps. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid of size 2xN. The goal is to determine if the character can reach the destination without falling into a trap. The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, and cells (1, 1) and (2, N) are always safe.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to read input from stdin\n- Implement a function to process each test case\n- Implement a function to check if the character can reach the destination\n- Implement a function to output the result for each test case\n- Ensure the program handles multiple test cases efficiently\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The program will read input from stdin, process each test case, and determine if the character can reach the destination without falling into a trap. The result for each test case will be outputted accordingly. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and check if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, N).\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': The character moves through a 2xN grid, using side and/or corner moves to reach the destination.\n    Explanation: The character starts at position (1, 1) and must navigate through the grid to reach (2, N). The grid consists of safe ('0') and trap ('1') cells. The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, but must avoid traps.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and check if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, N). The algorithm will:\n    1. Initialize a queue with the starting position (1, 1).\n    2. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n    3. Dequeue a cell, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonal if applicable), and enqueue any valid moves.\n    4. Continue until the queue is empty or the destination (2, N) is reached.\n    5. Return \"YES\" if the destination is reached, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: n = 3, grid = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid is small and the starting and ending cells are safe. The character can move directly to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, grid = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The character can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4), avoiding the traps.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, grid = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The character is trapped as soon as it moves to the second row. There is no way to reach (2, 4) without falling into a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for the edge cases provided, as the BFS algorithm inherently handles edge cases like starting and ending in safe cells. However, for a more robust solution, one could add checks to ensure the grid dimensions and cell contents are valid.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game is a grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate a character through a 2xN grid avoiding traps. The goal is to reach the end of the grid from the start. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a different grid size and trap distribution. The output should indicate whether it is possible to complete the level for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game logic to determine if the character can reach the end of the grid.\n- Handle input for multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Output the result for each test case as YES or NO.\n- Ensure the game interface is responsive and visually appealing.\n- Include options for difficulty levels to cater to different skill sets.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The game logic will be implemented in a Python function that takes the grid as input and returns 'YES' if the character can reach the end of the grid, otherwise 'NO'. The function will check the safety of each cell in the grid and determine if there's a path from the start to the end.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid, specifically a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns.\n    'safe cells': cells that the character can move to without dying.\n    'pathfinding': determining if there's a sequence of safe cells from the start to the end.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will follow these steps:\n    1.

Use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore the grid from the start to the end.\n    4. Mark cells as visited and check if they are safe.\n    5.
