{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The game is a simple grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate from the starting point (1, 1) to the goal (2, n) without stepping on any traps. The traps are represented by '1' in the grid, and the player can move to adjacent cells by side or corner. The challenge is to determine if a path exists from the start to the goal without hitting a trap.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting a trap.\n- Ensure the game can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for input and output.\n- Design a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.\n- Implement a scoring system to track player performance.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The function will take the number of test cases and for each test case, it will read the grid dimensions and the grid itself. The function will then check if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any traps. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and find the path if it exists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid, specifically a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns.\n    Explanation: The grid consists of safe ('0') and trap ('1') cells. The goal is to find a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the goal cell (2, n) without stepping on any trap cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least as many times': means that the number of times a cell appears in the grid should be at least the value of the cell itself.\n    Explanation: For example, if a cell has a value of 2, it must appear at least twice in the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    Explanation: In the context of the problem, we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself in the grid.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan involves using a BFS algorithm to explore the grid and find a path from (1, 1) to (2, n).

The game involves navigating a grid with traps, and we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the goal cell (2, n). The BFS algorithm is suitable for this task because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found if one exists.

For each cell, check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n    4. If an adjacent cell is a trap or out of bounds, skip it.\n    5. If an adjacent cell is a safe cell, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n    6. Continue this process until the queue is empty or the goal cell (2, n) is reached.\n    7.
