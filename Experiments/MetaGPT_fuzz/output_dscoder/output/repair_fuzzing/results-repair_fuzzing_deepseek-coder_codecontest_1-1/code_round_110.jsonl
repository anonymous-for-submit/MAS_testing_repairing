{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

We will implement a function that reads the input, processes each test case, checks if Monocarp can reach the target cell, and outputs the result for each test case. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and ensure that Monocarp can reach the target cell without landing in a trap.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid navigation': Monocarp needs to navigate through a 2xN grid, moving between adjacent cells by side and/or corner, without landing in a trap cell.\n    Explanation: Monocarp starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The grid is represented by a 2xN matrix where each cell is either '0' (safe) or '1' (trap).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan involves using a BFS algorithm to explore the grid. The BFS will start from (1, 1) and will attempt to reach (2, n) by moving to adjacent cells. If a trap is encountered, the path is blocked, and the function should return 'NO'. If the target (2, n) is reached without encountering a trap, the function should return 'YES'.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 0011, 1100]) = YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can navigate through the grid by moving from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then to (2, 3), and finally to (2, 4) without landing in a trap.\n    search([4, 0111, 1110]) = NO\n    Explanation: Monocarp would land in a trap at (2, 3) and cannot proceed further.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The BFS algorithm inherently handles the exploration of the grid and checks for traps.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Here's a simplified version of the code logic:\n\n    ```python\n    from collections import deque\n\n    def can_reach_target(grid, n):\n        # Define possible moves: side and corner\n        moves = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]\n        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n        queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # Start from (0, 0) which corresponds to (1, 1)\n        visited[0][0] = True\n\n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            if y == n - 1:  # If we reach the last column, we are at (2, n)\n                return \"YES\"\n            for dx, dy in moves:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == '0':\n                    visited[nx][ny] = True\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n        return \"NO\"\n\n    def solve():\n        t = int(input())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            grid = [input() for _ in range(2)]\n            result = can_reach_target(grid, n)\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This code reads the number of test cases and processes each one, using a BFS approach to determine if Monocarp can reach the target cell without landing in a trap.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game grid is a 2xN matrix with specific safety conditions for the starting and ending points. The task is to determine if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n) without stepping on any trap cells. This requires a simple pathfinding algorithm to check all possible paths.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if a path exists from (1,1) to (2,n) without stepping on traps.\n- Ensure the game interface is responsive and visually appealing.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for game settings and score display.\nWe will use a simple pathfinding algorithm to check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n) without stepping on any trap cells. The algorithm will iterate through the grid and check each cell to ensure it's safe. If a path is found, we will return 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'pathfinding': the process of finding a way from a starting point to an ending point while avoiding obstacles (traps in this case)\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    For each test case:\n    1.
