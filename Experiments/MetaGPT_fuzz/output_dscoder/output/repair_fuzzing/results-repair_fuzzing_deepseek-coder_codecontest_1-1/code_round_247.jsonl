The program will read the number of queries and then process each query accordingly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we are dealing with an array that can be dynamically modified by adding elements or replacing specific elements. This requires us to manage the state of the array as we process each query.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of queries can be greater than a certain threshold.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" is used to specify that the number of queries can be greater than a specific value, which in this case is 5 \u22c5 10^5. This means the program needs to handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets a certain condition.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"largest\" is used to specify that we need to find the largest integer that satisfies a given condition, which in this case is appearing at least as many times as the integer itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to represent the array.\n    2. Read the number of queries.\n    3. For each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x in the array with y.\n    4. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2\n    Explanation: The array [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1] contains the number 2 which appears twice, which is the same as its value. Therefore, the function should return 2.\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3\n    Explanation: The array [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4] contains the number 3 which appears three times, which is the same as its value. Therefore, the function should return 3.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1\n    Explanation: The array [5, 5, 4, 4, 4] contains the number 5 which appears twice, which is more than its value. The number 4 appears three times, which is also more than its value. Therefore, no integer appears exactly as many times as its value, so the function should return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not lst:\n            return -1\n        max_num = -1\n        for num in set(lst):\n            if lst.count(num) == num:\n                max_num = max(max_num, num)\n        return max_num if max_num != -1 else -1\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 247, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
