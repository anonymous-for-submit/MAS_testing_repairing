The program must handle a large number of queries efficiently, ensuring it can manage the upper limits of input constraints. The solution should be easy to understand and maintain, with a focus on performance and scalability.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle large input sizes efficiently.\n- Optimize memory usage to handle large datasets.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nWe will use a list to store the array of integers and implement two functions to handle the addition and replacement operations. The addition function will append the new element to the list, and the replacement function will iterate through the list to replace all occurrences of the specified element with another element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': handling a list of integers with addition and replacement operations.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing a dynamic list of integers, where elements can be added to the end and specific elements can be replaced with another element.

You have to perform q queries. Each query is of one of two types:\n\n  * \"1 x\" \u2014 add the element x to the end of the array;\n  * \"2 x y\" \u2014 replace all occurrences of x in the array with y.\n\nFind the resulting array after performing all the queries. Your task is to implement a function that efficiently handles these operations on the array. Ensure your implementation can handle large input sizes optimally.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.
