{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The challenge lies in handling large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these indices maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution provides clear and concise output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all possible pairs of indices to check if their deletion maintains the mean. This approach will be optimized to handle large inputs by avoiding unnecessary computations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean'\n    Explanation: The mathematical mean (or average) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.

There are no pairs of elements that can be deleted to maintain this mean since deleting any two elements will change the mean.\n\n    Edge case 2: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is 4. There are 6 possible pairs of elements to delete: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
