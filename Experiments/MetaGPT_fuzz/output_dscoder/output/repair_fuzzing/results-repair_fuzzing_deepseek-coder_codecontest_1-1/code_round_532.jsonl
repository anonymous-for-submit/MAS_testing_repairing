Initialize an empty list to store the array of integers.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For type 1 queries, append the element to the list.\n    4.

Edge cases such as an empty array or a non-existent element to replace must also be handled.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to an array.\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle large input sizes efficiently.\n- Implement error handling for edge cases such as an empty array or a non-existent element to replace.\n- Optimize the program for both time and space complexity.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to handle the queries efficiently. The program will use a list to store the array of integers and perform operations based on the query type. For large input sizes, we will ensure that the operations are optimized for both time and space complexity.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements with others.\n    Explanation: We need to handle an array and perform operations like adding elements and replacing specific elements based on given queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to ensure the array is not empty before performing operations.\n    Explanation: Before performing operations like replacement, we need to check if the array has any elements.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Not applicable in this context as there are no degree adverbs directly related to the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    - Iterate through each query.\n    - For query type \"1 x\": Append the element x to the array.\n    - For query type \"2 x y\": Replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    - Print the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    \n    Edge case 2:\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1.\n    \n    Edge case 3:\n    search([]) = -1\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so there are no integers to satisfy the condition. The expected output is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array is empty.\n        if not lst:\n            return -1\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 532, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
