{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This is a complex task due to the need for efficiency, especially for large inputs. The solution must be optimized to handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs [i, j] such that deleting elements at these positions maintains the original mean.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs.\n- Ensure the output is clear and easy to understand.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then finding pairs of indices whose deletion does not change the mean. We will use a hash map to store the counts of the differences between elements and the indices, which allows us to efficiently count the pairs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these indices does not change the mean of the remaining elements. The mean of the entire array is calculated and then we need to ensure that the mean of the remaining elements (after deleting two elements) is still equal to this mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this efficiently, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the entire array.\n    2. For each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j, calculate the new mean if these elements were deleted.\n    3. Use a hash map to count how many times each possible difference (new mean - original mean) occurs.\n    4. The number of valid pairs (i, j) is the number of times the difference is zero in the hash map.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. If we delete any pair of elements, the mean of the remaining elements will change. For example, deleting elements 1 and 2 results in a mean of (3+4)/2 = 3.5, which is different from 2.5.\n    Expected output: 0\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [2, 2, 2, 2]\n    Explanation: The original mean is (2+2+2+2)/4 = 2. If we delete any pair of elements, the mean of the remaining elements will still be 2. For example, deleting elements 1 and 2 results in a mean of (2+2)/2 = 2.\n    Expected output: 6 (There are 6 pairs: [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4])\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
