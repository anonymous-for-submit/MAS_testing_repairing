{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

The main challenge is to generate the sequence of special numbers efficiently, especially for large values of k. We will use a mathematical approach to generate these numbers without explicitly storing the entire sequence, which is crucial for handling large k values.

The output will be in increasing order modulo 10^9+7 for each test case.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sums of different non-negative powers of n': This means that each number in the sequence can be represented as a sum of unique powers of n, similar to how binary numbers are sums of different powers of 2.\n    Explanation: For example, if n = 2, then numbers like 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 3 (2^0 + 2^1), 4 (2^2), etc., are all special numbers because they can be represented as sums of different powers of 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'different non-negative powers': means that each power of n used in the sum must be unique.\n    Explanation: For instance, in the sequence generated for n = 2, the number 3 is included because it is 2^0 + 2^1, using two different powers of 2.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing order': means that the sequence should be sorted from smallest to largest.\n    Explanation: This is crucial for finding the k-th special number, as we need to know the order of the numbers in the sequence.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To generate the sequence of special numbers, we can use a loop to iterate through the powers of n and sum them up, ensuring that each power is used only once. We will use a modulo operation to keep the numbers within the range of 10^9+7.\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 1, k = very large\n    expected output = 0\n    Explanation: If n is 1, then the only special number is 1^0, which is 1. Since k can be very large, we need to handle this edge case by returning 0 if n is 1, as there will be no special numbers beyond 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is 1.\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n\nThis extra code ensures that the function returns 0 immediately if n is 1, as there are no special numbers to find in this case.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating a program that can determine the k-th special number for a given base n, considering the constraints of n and k. The special number is defined as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. The output should be the k-th special number modulo 10^9+7. The program must handle multiple test cases efficiently. Edge cases such as n=1 and very large k should also be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the k-th special number for a given n.\n- Ensure the output is given modulo 10^9+7.\n- Validate inputs n and k to ensure they meet the problem constraints.\n- Handle edge cases where n=1 and k is very large.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large values of n and k efficiently.\nTo solve this problem, we will use a mathematical approach to generate the k-th special number for a given base n. The special number is defined as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. We will validate the inputs for n and k to ensure they meet the problem constraints. For large values of n and k, we will optimize the solution to handle them efficiently by using modular arithmetic to keep the numbers within the required range. The output will be given modulo 10^9+7.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': a number that can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: A special number for a given base n is one that can be expressed as the sum of distinct non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4, the number 17 is special because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find numbers greater than zero.\n    'different non-negative powers': means that each power of n used in the sum must be unique.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the largest special number.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To generate the k-th special number for a given base n, we can use a mathematical approach to find the sum of different non-negative powers of n. We will validate the inputs for n and k to ensure they meet the problem constraints.

If k is very large, it means we are looking for a very high power of 1, which is not possible since there are no higher powers to sum. Therefore, the expected output is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is 1 and k is very large.\n    code for handling the edge case:\n    if n == 1:\n        if k == 1:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return -1\n    (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 212, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 156}
