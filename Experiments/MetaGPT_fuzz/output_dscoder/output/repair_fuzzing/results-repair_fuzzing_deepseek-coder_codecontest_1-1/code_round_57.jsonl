{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

This involves mapping each character to its position on the keyboard and calculating the distance between consecutive characters. Additional requirements include handling multiple test cases and ensuring the solution is efficient.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on a keyboard layout.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for performance.\n- Allow user customization of keyboard layouts.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to calculate the time required to type a word based on a given keyboard layout. We will map each character to its position on the keyboard and calculate the distance between consecutive characters. We will also handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key is uniquely identified by a specific character.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard is represented as a string of 26 unique characters, each corresponding to a key on the keyboard. The goal is to compute the time required to type a given word using this keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that a value must be greater than a specified amount.\n    Explanation: In this context, it means that the time taken to move between keys must be greater than zero.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Indicates the smallest or least possible amount or degree.\n    Explanation: The minimal time refers to the shortest amount of time required to type the word, considering the distance between consecutive keys.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word for each test case.\n    2. Map each character in the word to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Calculate the time taken to move between consecutive keys.\n    4. Sum the times for all consecutive keys to get the total time for the word.\n    5. Output the total time for each word.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The integer 3 appears three times, which is more than its value (3). Therefore, the function should return 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

The logic already includes a check to return -1 if no integer meets the condition.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'test cases': A set of inputs used to verify the correctness and robustness of a program.\n    Explanation: In this context, the test cases consist of a keyboard layout and a word, and the goal is to calculate the minimal time it takes to type the word on the given keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least as many times': Indicates that the frequency of an integer must be at least as much as its value to be considered.\n    Explanation: For example, if an integer appears at least as many times as itself, it should be considered in the result.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Indicates the preference for the smallest possible time.\n    Explanation: When calculating the typing time, the minimal time should be considered to ensure the most efficient typing.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the typing time calculator, we need to:\n    1. Read the number of test cases and the descriptions for each test case.\n    2. For each test case, read the keyboard layout and the word.\n    3. Map each character in the word to its position on the keyboard.\n    4. Calculate the time taken to type each character based on its position relative to the previous character.\n    5. Sum the times for all characters to get the total typing time for each test case.\n    6. Print the total typing time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that are all greater than zero. The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears three times.\n    search([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]) = 1\n    Explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 1, as it appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the list contains only one unique integer.\n        if len(set(lst)) == 1:\n            return lst[0]\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 57, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
