The challenge lies in handling large inputs efficiently, which is crucial for a good user experience. The solution should be robust and scalable to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries, each potentially adding or modifying elements in the array.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to an array.\n- Implement the ability to replace occurrences of a number with another number.\n- Ensure the solution can handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final array.\nTo efficiently handle the operations on the array, we will use a Python list which is dynamic and can handle large inputs well. For the query operations, we will iterate through each query and perform the necessary actions based on the type of query. For the '2 x y' query, we will use a temporary list to store the modified elements and then replace the original list with this new list. This approach ensures that we can handle large inputs without significant performance degradation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': a data structure that can grow or shrink in size as needed, allowing for efficient addition and removal of elements.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to handle a sequence of operations on an initially empty list. The operations include adding elements and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another. Using a dynamic array allows us to manage these operations efficiently, even with potentially large input sizes.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed the initial capacity.\n    'at least as many times': means that the number of occurrences of a specific element in the array should be replaced by another element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the operations described.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type '1 x', append the element x to the list.\n    4. For query type '2 x y', create a temporary list to store the modified elements. Iterate through the original list and replace all occurrences of x with y, then append the modified elements to the temporary list. Finally, replace the original list with the temporary list.\n    5. After processing all queries, return the final list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    expected output = 3\n    Explanation:\n    In this edge case, the array initially contains multiple occurrences of the number 2 and 4. After processing the query \"2 2 3\", all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 3. The final array should reflect this change, with 3 appearing more times than its value in the array.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan can handle the replacement of elements efficiently, even when the array contains multiple occurrences of the target element.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for a program to manage an array of integers, performing two types of operations: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another element.
