{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

They are arranged sequentially in one row following a specific order. The keys are placed in such a way that they follow the arrangement strictly without interruption. Each key is mapped to a distinct lowercase Latin letter. You'll need to type the word s using this keyboard, which also consists solely of lowercase Latin letters. To input a word, you are required to type its letters in sequence, one after another. To input each letter, you have to place your hand directly over the associated key and then press it. Moving your hand between keys requires time, which corresponds to the absolute difference in positions between those keys (with keys numbered from left to right). No time is required for pressing the keys or positioning your hand over the first letter. For instance, if the keyboard keys 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order, the letters 'h', 'e', 'l', and 'o' will be placed at positions 8, 5, 12, and 15, respectively. Thus, the required time to type \"hello\" is |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units. Calculate the required time to type the word s. Offer an efficient method to carry out this calculation. Make sure your solution is capable of handling large input sizes swiftly. Reflect on ways to precompute positions to further enhance performance. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo efficiently calculate the typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard layout, we will precompute the positions of the keys and use a simple iterative approach to calculate the typing time for each test case.

The goal is to calculate the total time required to type a word based on the positions of these keys.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that a value must be greater than another value.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than\" is used to specify that the time required for a move is the absolute difference in positions between the current and next keys, and this difference must be greater than zero.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': Indicates the minimum value that satisfies a condition.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"smallest\" is used to specify the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard, which means finding the smallest possible total time.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Precompute the positions of the keys on the keyboard.\n    2. For each test case, calculate the total time required to type the word s based on the positions of the keys.\n    3. Return the total time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Typing a word with consecutive keys.\n    search(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], 'abc') = 1\n    Explanation: The keys for 'a', 'b', and 'c' are consecutive, so the total time is the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive keys: |1-0| + |2-1| = 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: Typing a word with non-consecutive keys.\n    search(['a', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], 'abc') = 2\n    Explanation: The keys for 'a', 'b', and 'c' are not consecutive, so the total time is the absolute difference between each pair of keys: |1-0| + |3-2| + |2-1| = 2.\n\n    Edge case 3: Typing a word with a key not on the keyboard.\n    search(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], 'ax') = -1\n    Explanation: The key 'x' is not on the keyboard, so it's not possible to type the word 'ax'. The function should return -1 to indicate an error.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where a key in the word is not present on the keyboard.\n    def search(keyboard, word):\n        key_positions = {key: idx for idx, key in enumerate(keyboard)}\n        total_time = 0\n        for i in range(len(word) - 1):\n            current_key = word[i]\n            next_key = word[i + 1]\n            if current_key not in key_positions or next_key not in key_positions:\n                return -1\n            total_time += abs(key_positions[current_key] - key_positions[next_key])\n        return total_time\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 distinct lowercase Latin letters. The word to be typed is also provided, with a length ranging from 1 to 50 characters. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the time based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard, considering the absolute difference in positions for each pair of consecutive letters in the word.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the solution can handle up to 1000 test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the calculation by precomputing the positions of the keys on the keyboard.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting the keyboard layout and the word to be typed.\nTo efficiently calculate the typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard layout, we will use Python's built-in data structures and simple arithmetic operations.

The time required to type \"hello\" is |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units.\n\n    Test Case 2:\n    Keyboard: \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\"\n    Word: \"world\"\n    Expected Output: 28\n    Explanation: The positions of the letters in the word \"world\" on the keyboard are 19, 24, 18, 16, and 15.
