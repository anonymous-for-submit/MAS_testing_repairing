{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This requires summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then iterating through pairs to check if their deletion maintains the mean. The challenge lies in optimizing this for large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check if their deletion maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs to ensure it runs efficiently within the given constraints.\n- Handle edge cases where no pairs can be deleted to maintain the mean.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair iteration. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all possible pairs of positions to check if their deletion maintains the mean. The key challenge is to ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The mean of an array is calculated by summing all its elements and then dividing by the number of elements.
