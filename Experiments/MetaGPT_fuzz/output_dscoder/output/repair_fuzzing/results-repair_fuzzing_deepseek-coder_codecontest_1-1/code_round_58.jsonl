{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

Since the result needs to be modulo 10^9+7, we should use modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.\n\n    Example code for handling edge cases:\n    ```python\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    def find_kth_special_number(n, k):\n        result = 0\n        power = 0\n        while k > 0:\n            if k % n == 1:\n                result += n**power\n                result %= MOD\n            k //= n\n            power += 1\n        return result\n\n    # Test the function with edge cases\n    print(find_kth_special_number(2, 1))  # Expected output: 1\n    print(find_kth_special_number(3, 2))  # Expected output: 2\n    print(find_kth_special_number(4, 5))  # Expected output: 17\n    ```\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to generate the k-th special number in the sequence of numbers that can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n. The output should be in increasing order and modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers efficiently. The application should be able to process multiple test cases efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to generate the sequence of special numbers.\n- Ensure the sequence is generated in increasing order.\n- Implement modulo operation to handle large numbers.\n- Create a user-friendly interface to input the base number and the position in the sequence.\n- Ensure the application can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nTo generate the k-th special number in the sequence of numbers that can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n, we will use a mathematical approach to identify the sequence and then find the k-th element. The sequence is essentially the set of numbers that can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of n. Given the constraints, we will use Python's efficient handling of large numbers and apply the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range. The sequence will be generated iteratively, checking each number to see if it can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of n.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sum of distinct non-negative powers of n': This means that each special number can be represented as a sum of unique powers of n, where n is a positive integer.\n    Explanation: For example, for n = 4, the special numbers include 1, 4, 16, 64, etc., because these numbers can be expressed as sums of distinct non-negative powers of 4 (e.g., 4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, etc.).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find numbers greater than a certain value.\n    'distinct non-negative powers': Indicates that the powers of n used in the sum must be unique and non-negative.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing order': Indicates that the sequence should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To generate the k-th special number, we need to:\n    1.
