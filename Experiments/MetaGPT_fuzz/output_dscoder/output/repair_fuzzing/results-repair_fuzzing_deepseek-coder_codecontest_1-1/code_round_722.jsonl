Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = \"1 x\" where x is a very large number (e.g., 5 * 10^5)\n    expected output = The array should be able to handle large numbers without crashing.\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the robustness of the array handling large numbers. The array should dynamically resize if necessary to accommodate large numbers.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The Python list will automatically handle large numbers without issues.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 722, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
