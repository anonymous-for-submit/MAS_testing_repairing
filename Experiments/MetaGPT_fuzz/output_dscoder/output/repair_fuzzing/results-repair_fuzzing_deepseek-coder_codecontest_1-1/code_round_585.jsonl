Each query of type '1' will append an element to the list, and each query of type '2' will replace all occurrences of a specified element with another. We will optimize the performance by leveraging Python's dynamic array capabilities, which are well-suited for such operations. Additionally, we will implement error handling to manage invalid queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': a data structure that can grow or shrink in size as needed, allowing for efficient append and update operations.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to handle a large number of queries efficiently, and a dynamic array (list in Python) is well-suited for this purpose. It allows us to append elements and replace occurrences of elements without worrying about the size of the array beforehand.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find integers whose count is greater than or equal to their value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the largest integer that meets the given condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type '1 x', append 'x' to the list.\n        - If the query is of type '2 x y', replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list.\n    3. Return the resulting list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = \"1 x\" where x is an invalid value (e.g., greater than 5 \u22c5 10^5).\n    expected output = Error message: \"Invalid query\".\n    Explanation: Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one query of the first type, we need to handle cases where the input value is invalid. This could be due to exceeding the specified range or other constraints not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if x > 5 * 10^5:\n            return \"Error message: Invalid query\"\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = \"2 x y\" where x or y is an invalid value.\n    expected output = Error message: \"Invalid query\".\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, we need to handle invalid input values for replacements. If either 'x' or 'y' is greater than 5 \u22c5 10^5, the query is invalid.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if x > 5 * 10^5 or y > 5 * 10^5:\n            return \"Error message: Invalid query\"\n\n# [edge case] \n    Empty list of queries.\n    expected output = Error message: \"No queries provided\".\n    Explanation: Although the problem guarantees at least one query of the first type, we should handle the case where no queries are provided.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case.\n        if q == 0:\n            return \"Error message: No queries provided\"\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve managing an array with two types of operations: appending elements and replacing specific elements. The performance of the application is critical, especially with a large number of queries and elements. The user interface should be intuitive to facilitate ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle large datasets.\n- Ensure the application can handle a high volume of queries without performance degradation.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the array.\n- Implement error handling to manage invalid queries gracefully.\n- Optimize the application for scalability and future feature additions.\nTo efficiently handle the requirements, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for dynamic array operations and a dictionary for the second type of query to efficiently replace elements. The list will be used to store the elements, and the dictionary will be used to map the elements to be replaced and their replacements.

The fourth query replaces all instances of 4 with 4, which has no effect on the array. The fifth query replaces all instances of 4 with 3, resulting in [3, 1, 3]. The sixth query adds 2, making the array [3, 1, 3, 2]. The final query replaces all instances of 2 with 7, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 7].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n\n    Output:\n    3 2 2 3 2\n\n    Explanation:\n    The array starts empty. After processing the first two queries, the array is [3, 1]. The third query replaces all instances of 1 with 2, resulting in [3, 2]. The next three queries add 2 and 1, respectively, making the array [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]. The final query replaces all instances of 1 with 3, resulting in [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic is sufficient to handle all the edge cases mentioned.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve managing an array and performing two types of queries on it. The first type appends an element, and the second type replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another. The system must handle a large number of queries efficiently, which requires optimizing for performance and memory usage. Edge cases such as invalid queries or empty arrays must also be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle large numbers of queries.\n- Ensure that the system can handle and process queries quickly.\n- Implement error handling for invalid queries.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\n- Optimize memory usage to handle large datasets.\nTo efficiently handle a large number of queries on an initially empty integer array, we will use a list to store the elements. For the second type of query, which involves replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the replacements. This approach ensures that the replacement operation is performed efficiently, even for large arrays and numerous queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding and replacing elements in a list based on given queries.\n    'performance optimization': the plan should consider handling large arrays and numerous queries efficiently.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': used to indicate that the number of elements in the array will exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': used to specify the condition that an element should appear a minimum number of times in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': used to identify the maximum value in the array after manipulations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    - Initialize a dictionary to keep track of replacements.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append 'x' to the list.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list using the dictionary.\n    - Return the final list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output:\n    1 2 1\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - The fourth query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, but since they are already the same, the array remains [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output:\n    1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is empty.\n    - After the second and third queries, the array is [1, 4].\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [1, 3].\n    - After the fifth query, the array is [1, 3, 3].\n    - After the sixth query, the array is [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this plan, as the logic provided is designed to handle the operations efficiently even for large arrays and numerous queries.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 585, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
