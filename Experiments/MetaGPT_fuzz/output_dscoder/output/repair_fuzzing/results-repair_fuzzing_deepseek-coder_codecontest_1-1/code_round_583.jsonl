{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The solution must be efficient to handle large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of pairs\n- Ensure the solution can handle large inputs within reasonable time limits\n- Provide clear and accurate output for each test case\n- Optimize the code for better performance\n- Add user-friendly input/output handling\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of indices to check if removing those elements results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. This method ensures that we only consider valid pairs and avoid unnecessary computations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements\n    'pairwise deletion': removing two specific elements from a list and checking if the mean remains unchanged\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of elements whose removal does not change the mean\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': suggests that we need to consider the largest possible number of pairs\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 0\n    explanation: No pair of elements can be removed to keep the mean unchanged since all elements are distinct.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 3\n    explanation: Pairs (0, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3) can be removed to keep the mean unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n < 3:\n            return 0  # No pairs can be removed if there are fewer than 3 elements\n        (other code)\n\nPlease provide the specific requirement and coding plan for the next prompt.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 583, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 452}
