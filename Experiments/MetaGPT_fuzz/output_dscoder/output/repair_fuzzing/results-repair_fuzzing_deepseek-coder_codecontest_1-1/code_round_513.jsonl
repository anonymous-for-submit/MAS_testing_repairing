Here's a high-level approach:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Initialize an empty dictionary to track replacements.\n    3. Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append x to the list.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the list using the dictionary.\n    4.

For the replace operation, we will iterate through the array to find all occurrences of the target element and replace them with the new element. This approach ensures that the replace operation is performed efficiently even when dealing with a large number of elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: The array is very large, with a large number of elements.\n    Edge case 2: The array contains many repeated elements, leading to numerous replacements.\n    Edge case 3: The queries are performed in a random order, requiring dynamic management of the array without prior knowledge of the final state.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases of a very large array or many repeated elements.\n    To handle a very large array, we can use Python's list data structure, which is optimized for dynamic resizing and efficient element access. For many repeated elements, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element, allowing for efficient replacement operations.\n\n    Example extra code for handling edge cases:\n    ```python\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the array elements\n    arr = []\n    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element\n    element_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Process each query\n    for _ in range(q):\n        query = input().split()\n        if query[0] == '1':\n            x = int(query[1])\n            arr.append(x)\n            element_counts[x] += 1\n        elif query[0] == '2':\n            x, y = int(query[1]), int(query[2])\n            if element_counts[x] > 0:\n                arr = [y if elem == x else elem for elem in arr]\n                element_counts[y] += element_counts[x]\n                element_counts[x] = 0\n    ```\n\n    Explanation:\n    - We use a list `arr` to store the array elements.\n    - We use a dictionary `element_counts` to keep track of the counts of each element.\n    - For the \"1 x\" query, we add `x` to the array and update its count in the dictionary.\n    - For the \"2 x y\" query, we replace all occurrences of `x` with `y` in the array and update the counts in the dictionary.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 513, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
