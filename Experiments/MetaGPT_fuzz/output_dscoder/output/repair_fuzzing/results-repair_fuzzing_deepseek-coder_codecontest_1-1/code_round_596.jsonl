{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k, which is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i.e. sum divided by n). Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in libraries and data structures. The main idea is to calculate the mean of the array and then iterate through all possible pairs of elements to check if their removal maintains the mean. We will use a list to store the array and perform the necessary calculations and checks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Core Concept**:\n    - **Mathematical Mean**: The mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    - **Pairs of Positions**: We need to find pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j, and removing the elements at these positions results in the remaining elements having the same mean as the original array.\n\n2. **Phrase Showing Quantity Relationship**:\n    - **Exactly two elements**: We need to remove exactly two elements from the array.\n    - **Remaining elements**: After removal, the number of elements in the array is n - 2.\n\n3. **Degree Adverb**:\n    - **Equal**: The mean of the remaining elements should be equal to the mean of the original array.\n\n4. **Code Logic**:\n    - Calculate the mean of the array.\n    - Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j).\n    - For each pair, check if removing the elements at these positions results in the remaining elements having the same mean.\n    - Count such pairs.\n\n5. **Edge Case**:\n    - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it's impossible to remove two elements, so the result should be 0.\n    - **All Elements Equal**: If all elements are the same, removing any two elements will change the mean, so the result should be 0.\n    - **Edge Case for Mean Calculation**: Ensure that the mean calculation does not lead to division by zero or other arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Extra Code for Edge Cases**:\n    - Handle edge cases where the array has fewer than 2 elements.\n    - Ensure the mean calculation is robust against edge cases.\n\n### Detailed Logic:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the array `a`.\n2. Initialize a counter for valid pairs.\n3. Iterate through all pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j`.\n4. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at indices `i` and `j`.\n5. If the new mean equals the original mean, increment the counter.\n6. Return the counter as the result.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Single Element Array**:\n    - **Input**: `[5]`\n    - **Output**: `0`\n    - **Explanation**: There are no pairs to remove, and the mean cannot be calculated.\n\n2. **All Elements Equal**:\n    - **Input**: `[2, 2, 2]`\n    - **Output**: `0`\n    - **Explanation**: Removing any two elements will change the mean.\n\n3. **Normal Case**:\n    - **Input**: `[1, 3, 2, 4]`\n    - **Output**: `2`\n    - **Explanation**: Pairs `(0, 1)` and `(0, 2)` result in the remaining elements having the same mean.\n\n### Extra Code for Edge Cases:\n\n```python\ndef count_pairs_to_maintain_mean(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    \n    original_mean = sum(a) / n\n    count = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            new_sum = sum(a[:i]) + sum(a[i+1:j]) + sum(a[j+1:])\n            new_n = n - 2\n            if new_n > 0 and new_sum / new_n == original_mean:\n                count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis code will handle the edge cases and ensure that the mean calculation is robust.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions keeps the mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.
