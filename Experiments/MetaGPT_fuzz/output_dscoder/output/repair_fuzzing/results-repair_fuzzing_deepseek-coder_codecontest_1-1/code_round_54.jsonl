The provided logic already handles the case where all elements in the array are the same.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the array contains a single element or where all elements are the same.\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0  # Since there's only one element, the sum is 0.\n    if all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n        return (n * (n - 1) // 2) * a[0]  # Sum of GCDs for all pairs when all elements are the same.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 54, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^5).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the prettiness value of a modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 6 2 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n77", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 45}
