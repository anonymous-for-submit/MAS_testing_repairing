For query type 2, replace all occurrences of the specified element x with the element y in the array.\n    5. Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding 3, 1, and 2, the array becomes [3, 1, 2]. Replacing all 1s with 2s results in [3, 2, 2]. Adding another 2 and 1 makes the array [3, 2, 2, 1]. Finally, replacing all 1s with 3s results in [3, 2, 2, 3].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding 1, 2, and 1, the array becomes [1, 2, 1]. Replacing all 2s with 2 results in [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: After the first query, the array is empty. Adding 1 and 4, then 2, the array becomes [1, 4, 2]. Replacing all 1s with 4s results in [4, 4, 2]. Replacing all 4s with 3s results in [3, 3, 2]. Adding another 2 and replacing all 2s with 7 results in [3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
