The application must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries, which could potentially be in the order of 5 * 10^5. The solution should also consider edge cases such as very large arrays or many repeated elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to append integers to the array.\n- Implement the ability to replace all occurrences of a number with another number in the array.\n- Ensure the application can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Optimize the application for large datasets and repeated elements.\nTo efficiently handle the array operations as described, we will use Python due to its high performance and readability. The main challenge lies in managing the array and performing the replacements efficiently, especially with a large number of queries. We will use a list to represent the array and implement the replacement logic to ensure that the operations are performed in a timely manner.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing an array and performing operations like appending elements and replacing specific elements with others.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to handle an array where elements can be added and specific elements can be replaced. This requires efficient handling of the array to ensure that the operations are performed quickly, especially with a large number of queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of elements in the array can be greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': Refers to the condition where a specific element must appear a minimum number of times in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest element in the array that meets certain criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a list to represent the array and perform the operations as follows:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append x to the array.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace every occurrence of x in the array with y.\n    3. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Large number of queries\n    Edge case 2: Array contains many repeated elements\n    Edge case 3: Empty array initially\n\n    Edge case 1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the performance of the solution when dealing with a large number of queries.

For each query of type \"1 x\", append 'x' to the list. For each query of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list using the dictionary.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Large number of queries\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times,number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest interger that meets the need. \n\n# [code logic continued]\n    Initialize an empty list `arr` and a dictionary `replacements` to track substitutions.\n    Iterate through each query:\n        If the query is of type \"1 x\":\n            Append 'x' to `arr`.\n        If the query is of type \"2 x y\":\n            Add the replacement 'y' for 'x' in `replacements`.\n    After processing all queries, iterate through `arr` and replace each element with its corresponding replacement from `replacements` if it exists.\n    Return the resulting array `arr`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Array is very large\n    Explanation: If the array is very large, the solution should handle large datasets efficiently without performance degradation.\n    Edge case 2: Many repeated elements\n    Explanation: If the array contains many repeated elements, the solution should handle these efficiently to optimize performance.\n    Edge case 3: No valid replacements\n    Explanation: If no valid replacements are found, the solution should return the original array or handle it appropriately.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle large datasets efficiently. Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large inputs.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating an application that can handle two types of queries on an array of integers. The first type appends an integer to the array, and the second type substitutes all occurrences of a specified integer with another integer. The application must be efficient to handle a large number of queries, making it suitable for large datasets and real-time operations.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to append integers to the array.\n- Enable the substitution of integers in the array.\n- Ensure the application can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nTo efficiently handle the array operations, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for dynamic array manipulation and a dictionary for quick substitution lookups. The dictionary will map the old values to the new values to handle multiple replacements efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements and replacing specific values in an array.\n    'efficient handling': requires optimizing performance for large datasets.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates the presence of multiple queries and the need to handle them efficiently.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'efficiently': emphasizes the importance of optimizing the solution for large-scale data.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    - Initialize a dictionary to handle value substitutions.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append x to the array.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array using the dictionary.\n    - Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    query = [\"1 1\", \"1 2\", \"2 1 3\", \"1 4\"]\n    explanation: Initially, the array is [1, 2]. After the substitution query \"2 1 3\", the array becomes [3, 2]. Appending 4 results in the final array [3, 2, 4].\n    Edge case 2:\n    query = [\"1 1\", \"1 1\", \"2 1 2\", \"1 3\"]\n    explanation: The array starts with [1]. After the second \"1 1\", the array is [1, 1]. Substituting 1 with 2 results in [2, 2]. Appending 3 results in the final array [2, 2, 3].\n    Edge case 3:\n    query = [\"1 5\", \"1 5\", \"2 5 5\", \"1 5\"]\n    explanation: The array starts with [5]. After the second \"1 5\", the array is [5, 5]. Substituting 5 with 5 does not change the array. Appending another 5 results in the final array [5, 5, 5].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
