{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right starting with 1). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a function that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a keyboard based on the positional relationship between each letter. The function will take into account the positions of the keys on the keyboard and compute the cumulative time based on these positions. We will use Python for this implementation.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard is represented as a string of 26 unique lowercase Latin letters, and each letter is arranged in a specific order. The task is to calculate the time required to type a given word on this keyboard, considering the positional relationship between each letter.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of times a letter appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the phrase 'appears at least as many times' refers to the frequency of an integer in a list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the maximum or greatest value among a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the degree adverb 'largest' specifies that we need to find the largest integer in the list that meets the given condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word to be typed.\n    2. Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Iterate through the word to calculate the total time required to type it, considering the positional difference between consecutive letters.\n    4. Output the total time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The integer 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 3 is the largest integer that meets the condition, the output is 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where the list contains integers that appear more than or equal to their value, and we can find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time to type a word based on the keyboard layout and initial hand position. Each test case requires reading a keyboard layout and a word, then computing the minimum time to type the word.
