This involves understanding how deleting elements affects the sequence and how to track the count of such indices efficiently.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find indices where `a_i` is greater than `i`.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find indices where `a_i` is equal to `i`.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the maximum count of indices where `a_i` equals `i`.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n    1.

Return the maximum count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5\n    explanation: In this case, the sequence is already in the form where each element is equal to its index, so no elements need to be removed. The function should return the length of the sequence, which is 5.\n    search([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) = 1\n    explanation: In this case, the sequence is in reverse order, meaning no element is equal to its index.
