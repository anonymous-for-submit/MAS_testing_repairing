{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Sum the times to get the total typing time for the word.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The number 3 appears 3 times, which is more than or equal to its value. Since 3 is the largest number that meets the condition, the function returns 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the list is empty or contains only one element.\n    Explanation: If the list is empty, the function should return -1 since there are no integers to compare. If the list contains only one element, it should return that element since it appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    def search(lst):\n        if not lst:\n            return -1\n        if len(lst) == 1:\n            return lst[0]\n        frequency = {}\n        for num in lst:\n            if num in frequency:\n                frequency[num] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[num] = 1\n        for num, freq in frequency.items():\n            if freq >= num:\n                largest = num\n        return largest if 'largest' in locals() else -1\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the minimal time to type a word based on a given keyboard layout.
