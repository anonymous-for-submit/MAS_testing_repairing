{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner, but there are traps in some cells, and if Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n. Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The game is a simple grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without falling into traps. The constraints ensure that the starting and ending cells are safe. The output should be a binary decision (YES/NO) for each test case indicating whether the level can be completed or not.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code must read the input correctly and process each test case.\n- The game logic must determine if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any traps.\n- The output must be formatted as specified, with YES or NO for each test case.\n- The solution must be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The main challenge is to determine if there is a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without hitting any traps. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and check for possible paths. The BFS will help us avoid revisiting cells and ensure that we find the shortest path if one exists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid to find a path from the start to the end without hitting traps.\n    Explanation: The grid consists of '0' (safe) and '1' (trap) cells. The goal is to determine if there's a sequence of moves from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n) without landing on any '1'.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a BFS approach:\n    1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n    2. Initialize a queue for BFS starting from (1, 1).\n    3. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting.\n    4. Perform BFS:\n        - Dequeue the current cell.\n        - Check if the current cell is the target (2, n).\n        - If not, enqueue all adjacent safe cells (up, down, left, right) that haven't been visited.\n        - Mark the current cell as visited.\n    5. If the queue is exhausted without reaching (2, n), return \"NO\".\n    6. If (2, n) is reached, return \"YES\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x3 matrix with all cells safe.
