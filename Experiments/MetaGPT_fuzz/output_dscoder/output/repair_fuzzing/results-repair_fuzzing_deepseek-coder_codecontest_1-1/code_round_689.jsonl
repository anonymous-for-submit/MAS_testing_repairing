For the second query type, which involves replacing elements, we will use the replace method available in Python's list class. This approach ensures that we can handle large datasets efficiently without the overhead of using specialized data structures or libraries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'list manipulation': understanding how to add and modify elements in a list.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing a list of integers, adding new elements and replacing existing ones based on given queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': indicates the frequency of an element's occurrence in the list.\n    Explanation: This phrase is crucial for identifying how many times a specific element should be replaced in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'most': suggests that the element to be replaced should be the most frequent or prominent in the list.\n    Explanation: This degree adverb helps in understanding the requirement to find or replace the most common element in the list.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the integers.\n    - Iterate through each query.\n    - For query type \"1 x\", append the integer x to the list.\n    - For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the list.\n    - Return the final list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], 2, 5) = [1, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: The element 2 is to be replaced with 5, so all occurrences of 2 in the list are substituted with 5.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1, 2, 3], 4, 5) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The element 4 to be replaced is not in the list, so the list remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the element to be replaced is not present in the list.\n        if x not in lst:\n            continue  # Skip this query if x is not in the list\n        (other code)\n\n    This ensures that we do not attempt to replace an element that is not present in the list, which would otherwise lead to an error.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating a list and performing two types of operations on it: adding elements and replacing elements.
