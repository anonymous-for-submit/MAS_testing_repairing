{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This can be done by:\n    1. Calculating the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterating through all pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. Checking if the deletion of the elements at these indices maintains the mean.\n    4. Counting the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge cases to consider:\n    - Small array size: When n is very small (3 \u2264 n \u2264 5), the number of pairs is limited, and a brute-force approach might be sufficient.\n    - Large array size: When n is large (up to 2 \u22c5 10^5), the solution needs to be efficient to handle the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n    - Array with all elements equal: If all elements are the same, any pair of deletions will maintain the mean.\n    - Array with zero values: If the array contains zero values, careful handling is needed to avoid division by zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases:\n    - For small arrays, a brute-force approach can be used.\n    - For large arrays, ensure the sum and mean calculations are efficient.\n    - Handle cases with zero values by checking if any element is zero before deletion.\n\n    Example extra code for handling zero values:\n    if 0 in a:\n        # Handle zero values appropriately\n        pass\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 97, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 92}
