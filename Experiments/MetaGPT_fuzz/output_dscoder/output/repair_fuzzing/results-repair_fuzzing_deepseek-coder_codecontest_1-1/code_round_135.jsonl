{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The goal is to move from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, N) while not landing on any trap ('1').\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'adjacent cells': Cells that share a side or corner.\n    Explanation: In this grid, moving from one cell to an adjacent cell means moving horizontally or diagonally to an adjacent cell in the same row or to an adjacent cell in the other row.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'avoid': Refers to not landing on a trap cell.\n    Explanation: The goal is to ensure that during the traversal, the path does not include any cell marked as a trap ('1').\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a BFS algorithm:\n    1. Initialize a queue for BFS with the starting position (1, 1).\n    2. Use a visited set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n    3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the current cell and check if it's the destination (2, N).\n    4. If it is the destination, return YES.\n    5. Otherwise, enqueue all valid adjacent cells (side and corner moves) that are not traps and haven't been visited.\n    6. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, return NO.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3\n    Input: 3\n        000\n        000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns, Monocarp can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4\n    Input: 4\n        0011\n        1100\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: Despite the presence of traps, there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, 4) that avoids all traps.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4\n    Input: 4\n        0111\n        1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The traps block any path from (1, 1) to (2, 4).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the BFS logic inherently checks all possible paths and avoids revisiting cells. The constraints ensure that (1, 1) and (2, N) are safe, so the BFS will start and end within safe cells.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the constraints and conditions given in the problem statement.

The output is YES.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    n = 4\n    grid = ['0111', '1110']\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x4 grid with traps that block the path from (1, 1) to (2, 4).

The game grid has 2 rows and n columns, with the starting point (1, 1) and the target point (2, n) being safe. The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, and traps are indicated by '1'. The goal is to determine if the character can reach the target without falling into a trap.

BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists. We will start from cell (1, 1) and explore all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) to find a path to cell (2, n).
