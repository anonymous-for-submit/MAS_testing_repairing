The provided logic already covers all possible edge cases, including the scenario where the array starts empty and the case with multiple queries.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for an application that can handle two types of queries on an array of integers. The first type of query adds an element to the end of the array, and the second type replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another element. The application must be able to handle a large number of queries efficiently, ensuring that the resulting array is updated correctly after each query.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array.\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the application can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final array state.\nTo implement the application efficiently, we will use Python, leveraging its built-in list data structure for dynamic array operations and handling the queries efficiently. The application will process each query sequentially, updating the array as required by each type of query.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to manage an array of integers and perform two types of operations: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase suggests that the number of occurrences of a specific element must be considered in relation to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb implies that we need to find the largest integer that meets certain criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query = \"1 1\"\n    expected output = [1]\n    Explanation: The array starts empty and after processing the query \"1 1\", it contains the single element 1.\n\n    query = \"2 1 2\"\n    expected output = [2]\n    Explanation: The array starts empty and after processing the query \"2 1 2\", it contains the single element 2, as all occurrences of 1 are replaced with 2.\n\n    query = \"1 3\"\n    expected output = [2, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The array initially contains [2, 2, 3] after processing the query \"1 3\".\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
