The goal is to maximize this count by removing zero or more elements from the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the value of f(a) should be greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': means that the value of f(a) should be at least as large as a certain number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the largest possible value of f(a).\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum f(a) we can achieve by removing elements up to a certain point. We will iterate through the sequence, considering whether to remove the current element or not, and update our dynamic programming state accordingly.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5\n    Explanation: In this case, the sequence is already in the form where a_i = i for all i. Therefore, no elements need to be removed, and f(a) is maximized at 5.\n    search([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation: In this case, the sequence is in reverse order, so only one element (a_1 = 5) can satisfy a_i = i.
