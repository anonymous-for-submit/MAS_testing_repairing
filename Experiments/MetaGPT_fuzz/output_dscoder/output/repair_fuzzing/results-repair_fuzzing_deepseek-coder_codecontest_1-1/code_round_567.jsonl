The solution must be optimized for performance and scalability to handle large inputs and numerous queries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large datasets and numerous queries.\n- Ensure the system can handle real-time updates and changes to the array.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\n- Maintain high performance and reliability.\n- Provide a clear and concise output format.\nTo efficiently handle large datasets and numerous queries, we will utilize Python's built-in list data structure for dynamic array operations and optimize the replacement operation by leveraging dictionary lookups for quick access and updates. The list will be used to store the elements, and a dictionary will be used to track the positions of elements for efficient replacement operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': The array can grow or shrink in size as needed, allowing for the addition of new elements or removal of existing elements.\n    'replacement operation': The process of replacing one element with another in a collection.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a list to store the elements and a dictionary to keep track of the positions of elements for efficient replacement operations. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the elements.\n    2. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the positions of elements.\n    3. Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append x to the list and update the dictionary with the position of x.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x in the list with y by:\n            a. Iterating through the list and checking if the current element is x.\n            b. If it is x, remove it from the list and append y to the list, updating the dictionary accordingly.\n    4. Return the resulting list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [3].\n    - After the second query, the array is [3, 1].\n    - After the third query, the array becomes [3, 2] because 1 is replaced with 2.\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [3, 2, 2].\n    - After the fifth query, the array is [3, 2, 2, 1].\n    - After the sixth query, the array is [3, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n    - After the seventh query, the array becomes [3, 2, 2, 3, 2] because 1 is replaced with 3.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [1].\n    - After the second query, the array is [1, 2].\n    - After the third query, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - After the fourth query, the array becomes [1, 2, 1] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 2.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [4].\n    - After the second query, the array is [4, 1].\n    - After the third query, the array is [4, 1, 4].\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - After the fifth query, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 4] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 4.\n    - After the sixth query, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 3] because all occurrences of 4 are replaced with 3.\n    - After the seventh query, the array is [4, 1, 4, 3, 2].\n    - After the eighth query, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 3, 7] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
