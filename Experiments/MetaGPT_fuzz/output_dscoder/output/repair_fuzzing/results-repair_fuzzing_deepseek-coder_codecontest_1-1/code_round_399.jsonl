{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This requires a good understanding of mathematical operations and efficient data handling. The input is structured with multiple test cases, and the output should reflect the number of valid pairs for each case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of an array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of elements that can be deleted to maintain the mean.\n- Ensure the solution can handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Provide clear and accurate output for each test case.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for input and output.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array for each test case, then iterating through pairs of elements to check if their deletion maintains the mean. We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness, and later optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    Explanation: In this context, it means that the number of elements in the remaining array after deletion should still be equal to the original number of elements divided by the number of elements to be deleted (which is 2 in this case).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'exactly': means that the condition must be met without any deviation.\n    Explanation: This implies that we are looking for pairs of positions [i, j] where deleting the elements at these positions will result in the mean of the remaining elements being exactly equal to the original mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
