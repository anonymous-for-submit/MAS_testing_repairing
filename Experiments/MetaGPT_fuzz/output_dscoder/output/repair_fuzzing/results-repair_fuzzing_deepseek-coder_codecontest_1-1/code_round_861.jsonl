{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The initial position is the first key, and the hand moves to each subsequent key to type the word. The challenge is to minimize the total movement time across all test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on the keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the solution can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm to minimize hand movement time for each word typed.\n- Allow for different keyboard layouts to be inputted and processed correctly.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to calculate the time it takes to type a word on a given keyboard, considering the positions of the keys. We will create a function that takes the keyboard layout and the word as input and returns the total time required to type the word. The function will iterate through each letter in the word, calculate the distance from the current hand position to the target key, and sum these distances to get the total time.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': the arrangement of keys on the keyboard\n    'word typing': the process of pressing each letter key on the keyboard\n    'hand movement': the time taken to move the hand from one key to another\n    'absolute value': the distance between two keys on the keyboard\n\n    Explanation: The core concepts involve understanding the physical layout of a keyboard, the sequence of actions required to type a word, and the calculation of time based on the physical distance between keys.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least as many times': means that the frequency of a letter in the word should be at least as much as the letter itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the word \"abacaba\", the letter 'a' appears 4 times, which is at least as many times as its value (4).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest or least amount of time required to complete the task.\n    Explanation: In the context of typing a word on a keyboard, minimizing the hand movements will result in the least amount of time.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1.
