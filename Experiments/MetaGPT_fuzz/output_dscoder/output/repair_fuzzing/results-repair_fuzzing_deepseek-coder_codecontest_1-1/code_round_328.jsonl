{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This requires iterating through all pairs of positions, checking the condition, and counting the valid pairs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check the condition.\n- Count the number of valid pairs that meet the condition.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution provides clear and accurate output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair-wise comparisons. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all pairs of positions to check if deleting these elements results in the remaining elements having the same mean. This approach will be optimized to handle large inputs by avoiding unnecessary computations and leveraging Python's efficient list operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the average of the elements in the array, calculated by dividing the sum of all elements by the number of elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through all pairs of positions to check if deleting these elements results in the remaining elements having the same mean.

Checking if the sum of the remaining elements (excluding the elements at indices i and j) divided by the number of remaining elements equals the mean of the original array.\n    4. Counting the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+2+3)/3 = 2. There are no pairs to delete since we need to delete at least two elements. The expected output is 0.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: n = 4, array = [1, 3, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+3+2+3)/4 = 2.25. The pairs to delete are [1, 2] and [2, 3] since deleting these elements results in the remaining elements having the mean of 2.25. The expected output is 2.\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: n = 5, array = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+1+1+1+1)/5 = 1.
