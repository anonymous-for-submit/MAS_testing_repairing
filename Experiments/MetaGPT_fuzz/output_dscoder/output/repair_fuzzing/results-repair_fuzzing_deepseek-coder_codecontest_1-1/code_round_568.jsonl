This approach is simple and leverages Python's built-in capabilities, which are optimized for performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'integer array manipulation': \n    The core concept involves managing an array of integers, where operations include adding elements to the end and replacing specific elements with others.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a Python list to store the array. For the second type of query (replace all occurrences of x in the array with y), we will iterate through the list and replace each occurrence of x with y using the `list.remove` method followed by `list.append` to add y to the end of the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n\n    Output:\n    1 2 1\n\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - The query \"2 2 2\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1] unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n\n    Output:\n    1 3 3 7\n\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [4].\n    - After the second query, the array is [4, 1].\n    - After the third query, the array is [4, 1, 2].\n    - The query \"2 2 4\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in [4, 1, 4].\n    - The query \"2 4 3\" replaces all occurrences of 4 with 3, resulting in [3, 1, 3].\n    - After the seventh query, the array is [3, 1, 3, 2].\n    - The query \"2 2 7\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 7, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the provided logic is sufficient for the given constraints.
