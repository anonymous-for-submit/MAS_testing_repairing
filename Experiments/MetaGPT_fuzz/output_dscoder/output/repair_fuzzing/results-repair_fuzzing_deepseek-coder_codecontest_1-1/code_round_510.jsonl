The system must be efficient, capable of handling up to 5 \u22c5 10^5 queries, and robust against edge cases such as large numbers of repeated elements. The user interface should be straightforward to ensure ease of use.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle array operations.\n- Ensure the system can handle up to 5 \u22c5 10^5 queries.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\n- Optimize the system to handle edge cases, including large numbers of repeated elements.\n- Test and validate the system's performance against the upper limit of 5 \u22c5 10^5 queries.\nTo efficiently handle the given queries, we will use a list to store the array of integers and a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each element for efficient replacement. The list will be dynamically updated based on the queries, and the dictionary will help in replacing elements quickly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements with others.\n    'efficient handling': the solution should be optimized to handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': used to indicate that an element should be replaced if it appears more than once in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the operations described in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    - Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each element.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\":\n            - Add the element x to the end of the array.\n            - Update the dictionary to reflect the new element.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\":\n            - Replace all occurrences of x in the array with y.\n            - Update the dictionary to reflect the changes.\n    - Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n\n    Output: \n    1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [4].\n    - After adding 1, the array becomes [4, 1].\n    - After adding 4, the array becomes [4, 1, 4].\n    - After adding 2, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - Replacing all occurrences of 2 with 4 results in [4, 1, 4, 4].\n    - Replacing all occurrences of 4 with 3 results in [3, 1, 3, 3].\n    - Adding 2 again results in [3, 1, 3, 3, 2].\n    - Replacing all occurrences of 2 with 7 results in [3, 1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
