{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The goal is to determine the time required to type a word on this keyboard, considering the initial hand position and the time taken to move the hand between keys.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than\" is used to compare the frequency of an integer with its value. For example, \"appears more than itself\" means the frequency of the integer is greater than its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the greatest or biggest value in a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"largest integer\" refers to the integer with the highest value among those that meet the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1.

The number 3 appears three times, which is more than its value (3). It is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: The list is [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]. Both 2 and 3 appear more than themselves (2 and 3 times, respectively). However, 3 is the largest number among them.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The list is [3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]. The number 2 appears once, 3 appears twice, and 4 appears three times. None of these numbers appear more than themselves.
