The program should be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries, up to 5 * 10^5, and should be able to handle edge cases such as replacing a number that does not exist in the array.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array\n- Ensure the program can handle a large number of queries efficiently\n- Consider edge cases such as replacing a non-existent element\nTo efficiently handle the array operations as described, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for basic operations and the `collections.defaultdict` for managing the replacement operations. The defaultdict will help in managing the counts of elements which simplifies the replacement process significantly. We will also use a simple loop to process each query, ensuring that each operation is performed efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements and replacing elements based on specific conditions.\n    'efficient handling': requires optimizing performance for large datasets.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates the presence of a condition where an element must be present more times than its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': suggests the need to find the largest integer that meets a specific condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    - Use a defaultdict to count occurrences of each element for replacement operations.\n    - Process each query:\n        - For query type 1 x: Append x to the array.\n        - For query type 2 x y: Replace all instances of x with y using the defaultdict for efficient counting.\n    - Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query([1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 2], [3, 3, 3]) = [1, 3, 3]\n    Explanation:\n    - The initial array is [1, 2, 3].\n    - After the first query (1, 2), the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 2].\n    - After the second query (2, 1), the array becomes [1, 1, 3, 1].\n    - After the third query (3, 3), the array becomes [1, 1, 3, 1].\n    - The final array after all queries is [1, 1, 3, 1].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where a replacement is attempted with an element not present in the array.\n    - Before performing a replacement, check if the element x exists in the array.\n    - If x does not exist, skip the replacement operation or handle it as needed (e.g., raise an error or leave the array unchanged for that query).\n\n    Example code snippet for checking existence:\n    if x in array:\n        Perform replacement using defaultdict for efficiency.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 599, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
