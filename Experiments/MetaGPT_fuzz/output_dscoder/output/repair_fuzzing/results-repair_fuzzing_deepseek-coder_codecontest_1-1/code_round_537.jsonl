The output should be a list of integers representing the state of the array after all queries have been processed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle large numbers of queries efficiently.\n- Implement error handling for cases where an element to be replaced is not present in the array.\n- Optimize the program for both memory and processing time to handle large data sets.\nWe will use Python, leveraging its dynamic nature and the ability to handle large data sets efficiently. The program will maintain a list to represent the array of integers and will handle queries by either appending elements or replacing occurrences of a specified element with another. To optimize performance, we will use Python's built-in list operations which are optimized for such tasks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing a list of integers and performing operations like adding elements and replacing specific elements with others.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty list, where each operation can either add an element to the end of the list or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the operation involves a comparison of quantities, specifically replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"replace all occurrences of x in the array with y\" means that every instance of x in the array should be changed to y.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Not applicable in this context as there is no mention of finding the largest element in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests handling each query sequentially, with no indication of needing to consider multiple steps simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n        Input: \n        4\n        1 1\n        1 2\n        1 1\n        2 2 2\n        \n        Output: \n        1 2 1\n        \n        Explanation: \n        After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1]. The query \"2 2 2\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, but since 2 is already the only element in the array, the array remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic already correctly handles the scenario where the array remains unchanged due to the absence of the element x.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 537, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
