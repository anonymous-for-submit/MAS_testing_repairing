The \"2 1 5\" query replaces all occurrences of 1 with 5, resulting in the final array [5, 2, 3, 4].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic is sufficient to handle the operations efficiently.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to handle a large number of queries efficiently, which includes adding elements to an array and replacing elements based on specified criteria. The solution must be optimized for performance to handle large inputs and ensure that the operations are user-friendly. The output should be a single line of integers representing the final state of the array.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large inputs.\n- Ensure the application is responsive and provides immediate feedback.\n- Provide a clear and concise output format.\n- Implement error handling to manage edge cases and ensure robustness.\n- Enhance the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.\nTo efficiently handle large numbers of queries and optimize performance, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for dynamic array operations and a dictionary for quick lookup and replacement operations. The list will be used to store the elements, and the dictionary will map each element to its occurrences for efficient replacement.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': a data structure that can grow or shrink in size as needed, allowing for efficient addition and removal of elements.\n    'dictionary': a data structure that stores key-value pairs, providing efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find integers whose occurrences are at least a certain number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    explanation: Number 2 appears once, number 3 appears twice, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
