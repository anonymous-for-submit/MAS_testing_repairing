The program will process each query sequentially, updating the array as required.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept here is performing operations on an array, specifically appending and replacing elements.\n    Explanation: We need to handle two types of operations: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase is not directly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred from the context of the operations.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This phrase is not directly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred from the context of the operations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a Python list to store the array. For each query of type \"1 x\", we append the element x to the array. For each query of type \"2 x y\", we replace all occurrences of x with y in the array. We will process each query sequentially and update the array accordingly.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 3\n    Output: \n    1 3 3\n    Explanation: \n    The array starts empty. After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1]. The query \"2 2 3\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 3, resulting in the final array [1, 3, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: \n    5\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 3\n    2 2 4\n    1 5\n    Output: \n    1 4 5\n    Explanation: \n    The array starts empty. After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 3]. The query \"2 2 4\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in the array [1, 4, 3]. The query \"1 5\" appends 5 to the end, resulting in the final array [1, 4, 3, 5].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: \n    3\n    2 1 2\n    1 3\n    2 2 1\n    Output: \n    2 3\n    Explanation: \n    The array starts empty. The query \"2 1 2\" replaces all occurrences of 1 with 2, resulting in the array [2]. The query \"1 3\" appends 3 to the end, resulting in the array [2, 3]. The query \"2 2 1\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 1, resulting in the final array [1, 3].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
