{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then checking pairs of elements to see if their removal maintains the mean. Special cases for fewer than three elements need to be considered.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through pairs of positions and check if removing them maintains the mean.\n- Ensure the solution handles edge cases where the array has fewer than three elements.\n- Optimize the solution for performance to handle large inputs within the given constraints.\n- Provide clear and accurate results for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through pairs of positions to check if removing them maintains the mean. We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness and then optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements, which is a fundamental concept in statistics and programming.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly two elements': means that we need to consider pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the entire array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, remove the elements at positions i and j and check if the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3]) = 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, there are no pairs to remove, so the expected output is 0.\n    search([1, 1, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so removing any two elements will not change the mean. There is only one pair to consider, which is [0, 1].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic for counting pairs can be directly applied to the edge case.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n < 3:\n            return 0\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 673, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 563}
