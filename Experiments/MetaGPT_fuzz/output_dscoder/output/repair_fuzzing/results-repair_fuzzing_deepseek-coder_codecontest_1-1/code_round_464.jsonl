{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements. You should note that it's possible that k is not an integer. The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the total of elements divided by the quantity of these elements (i.e., sum divided by n). Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a). Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a). Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array. The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).

Count the number of pairs where the mean of the remaining elements is equal to the original mean.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: If there are only three elements in the array, there are no pairs to delete, so the output is 0.\n\n    Edge case 2: All elements are the same\n    Expected output: (n choose 2)\n    Explanation: If all elements in the array are the same, any two elements can be deleted, and the mean of the remaining elements will still be the same as the original mean. The number of such pairs is given by the binomial coefficient (n choose 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: Array contains zero\n    Expected output: (n choose 2) - n + 1\n    Explanation: If the array contains zero, we need to ensure that the mean of the remaining elements is still the original mean. This edge case requires a specific handling to avoid division by zero and to ensure the mean remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array contains zero, as it can affect the mean calculation.\n    def count_pairs(arr, mean):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n                temp_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:j] + arr[j+1:]\n                if sum(temp_arr) / (len(arr) - 2) == mean:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n\n    This code includes a check to ensure that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean after deleting two elements.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. The solution must be efficient and capable of handling up to 2 * 10^5 elements across multiple test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Develop a method to find all pairs [i, j] where i < j.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Add error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Include user documentation and examples for better understanding.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of indices to check if removing those elements results in the mean remaining unchanged. We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness and then optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': The average value of a set of numbers. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    'at least as many times': Indicates a minimum frequency or occurrence of an element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the greatest or highest value in a set.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. Check if removing the elements at these indices results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3]) = 0\n    Explanation: The mean of [1, 2, 3] is 2. There are no pairs of indices that can be removed to keep the mean unchanged since removing any two elements will change the mean.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation: The mean of [2, 2, 4, 4] is 3. We can remove the pair (0, 2) or (1, 2) to keep the mean unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the edge case where the array has only three elements.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has only three elements.\n        if n == 3:\n            return 1 if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] else 0\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has only three elements.\n        if n == 3:\n            return 1 if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] else 0\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 464, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 379}
