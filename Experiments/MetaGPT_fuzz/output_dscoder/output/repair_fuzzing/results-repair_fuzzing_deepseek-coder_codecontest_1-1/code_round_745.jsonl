{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Create a dictionary to map each key (letter) to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Iterate through the word to calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters.\n    3. Sum the absolute differences between the positions of consecutive letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: If the word is empty, the total time is 0 because no letters need to be typed.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 0\n    Explanation: If the word is empty, the total time is 0 because no letters need to be typed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle empty words.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time to type a word based on the positions of the keys on a keyboard. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the input and output, as well as considering edge cases. The product should be able to handle multiple test cases and provide accurate results for each.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the typing time for a given word on a custom keyboard.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution can handle edge cases like an empty word or a single-letter word.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.\nTo efficiently calculate the typing time for a given word on a custom keyboard, we will map each key to its position and then calculate the time based on the absolute difference between the positions of consecutive letters. We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the keys for quick lookup. The function will iterate through the word, calculating the time for each pair of consecutive letters and summing them up.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 characters, each representing a key on the keyboard. The goal is to calculate the time required to type a given word on this keyboard, considering the positions of the keys and the absolute value of the difference between the positions of consecutive letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the value of an integer is greater than another integer.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than\" is used to specify that the integer must be greater than zero, meaning the integer must be positive.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': Indicates the smallest value or the minimum amount.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"smallest\" is used to specify the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently calculate the typing time for a given word on a custom keyboard, we will:\n    1. Map each key to its position using a dictionary.\n    2. Iterate through the word, calculating the time for each pair of consecutive letters based on the absolute difference between their positions.\n    3. Sum the times for all consecutive letters to get the total typing time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the word is empty, no time is required to type it, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: An empty word appears four times in the original string. The function should handle this edge case by returning the count of appearances of the empty word in the original string.\n    how_many_times('a', 'a') = 1\n    Explanation: The word 'a' appears once in the original string, so the expected output is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1\n        (other code)\n\n    Explanation: The extra code is needed to handle cases where the original string or the substring is empty. If the original string is empty, the function should return 0. If the substring is empty, the function should return the length of the original string plus one, as the empty substring appears once for each character in the original string.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating an algorithm to calculate the time it takes to type a word on a given keyboard layout.
