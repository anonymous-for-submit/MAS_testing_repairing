This involves checking each element and deciding whether to remove it or not based on its impact on the count of matching indices.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: When the sequence is already in the optimal form, i.e., no elements need to be removed.\n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5\n    Explanation: In this case, every element's value matches its index, so no elements need to be removed. The function should return the length of the sequence as the maximum f(a).\n\n    Edge case 2: When removing one element can significantly increase the count of matching indices.\n    search([5, 3, 1, 2, 4]) = 4\n    Explanation: By removing the element at index 1 (value 5), the sequence becomes [3, 1, 2, 4], where the values at indices 2, 3, and 4 match their indices, resulting in f(a) = 4.\n\n    Edge case 3: When removing elements is necessary but does not necessarily increase the count.\n    search([2, 3, 4, 5, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation: Removing any element will not increase the count of matching indices. The best option is to remove elements that do not contribute to the count, which in this case is only the element at index 5 (value 1), leaving the sequence [2, 3, 4, 5], where f(a) = 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this problem.
