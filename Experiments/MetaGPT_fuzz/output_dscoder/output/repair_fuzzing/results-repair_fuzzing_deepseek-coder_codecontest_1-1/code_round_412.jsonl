The function f(a) is defined as the count of indices where a_i equals i, meaning it counts the positions in the sequence where the value matches the index. You can select an element from the current sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements together. For instance, if you remove the 3-rd element from the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the resulting sequence will be [4, 2, 1]. Your goal is to remove some elements from the sequence to maximize f(a).

The main challenge is to maximize f(a) by strategically removing elements from the sequence. We will use a list to represent the sequence and iterate through it to find the indices where the value matches the index. After identifying such indices, we will remove the corresponding elements and recalculate f(a) until no further improvement is possible.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence indexing': means that the elements in the sequence are indexed from 1 to n, and we need to find the positions where the value matches the index.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the sequence is indexed from 1 to n, and we need to find the count of indices where the value at position i is equal to i.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find indices where the value at position i is greater than i.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find indices where the value at position i is greater than or equal to i.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the maximum count of indices where the value at position i is equal to i.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the sequence and count the number of indices where the value matches the index.
