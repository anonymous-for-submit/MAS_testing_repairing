{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then checking pairs of elements to see if their removal maintains the mean. The challenge is to do this efficiently given the constraints on the size of the input.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through pairs of positions and check if removing them maintains the mean.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Add error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Provide clear and concise output for the number of valid pairs.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations. The main challenge is to calculate the mean and then find pairs of elements whose removal does not change the mean. We will iterate through the array and use a set to keep track of the elements that, when removed, would maintain the original mean. This approach ensures that we do not miss any valid pairs and is scalable for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mean of an array is calculated by summing all its elements and then dividing by the number of elements. Monocarp wants to remove two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains the same as the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of elements whose removal does not change the mean.\n    'divided by': used to calculate the mean of the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'same as': means equal to the original mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the original mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of elements in the array.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean of the remaining elements.\n    4. Count the number of pairs whose removal does not change the mean.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 2\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3. Removing the elements at positions 2 and 4 (values 2 and 4) results in the remaining elements summing to 6, which is also the mean of the original array.\n    search([1, 1, 1, 1]) = 0\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+1+1+1)/4 = 1.
