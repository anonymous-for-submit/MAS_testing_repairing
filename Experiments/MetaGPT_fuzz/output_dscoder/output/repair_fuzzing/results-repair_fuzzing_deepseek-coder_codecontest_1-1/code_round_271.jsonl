The first operation is straightforward, adding an element to the end of the array. The second operation is more complex, requiring the replacement of all occurrences of a specific element with another element. The system must handle a large number of queries efficiently, which implies that the solution should be optimized for performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array.\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise user instructions.\n- Ensure the product is user-friendly and easy to navigate.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use Python, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency. The solution will involve managing an array dynamically based on the queries received. We will use a list to represent the array, which is efficient for dynamic operations like appending and replacing elements. Each query will be processed in constant time, making the solution scalable for a large number of queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array management': The core concept involves managing an array that can grow or shrink dynamically based on the input queries.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty array, where each operation can either add an element to the end of the array or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed the initial count based on the operations performed.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase suggests that the number of replacements in the array can be equal to or greater than the number of occurrences of the specified element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb is not directly applicable in the context of the requirement, as the requirement focuses on replacing elements rather than finding the largest element in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to consider each query type separately:\n    1. For query type \"1 x\", we append the element x to the end of the array.\n    2. For query type \"2 x y\", we replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n\n    We will use a list to represent the array and perform the necessary operations based on the query type.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [3].\n    - After the second query, the array is [3, 1].\n    - After the third query, the array becomes [3, 2] because all occurrences of 1 are replaced with 2.\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [3, 2, 2].\n    - After the fifth query, the array is [3, 2, 2, 1].\n    - After the sixth query, the array is [3, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n    - After the seventh query, the array becomes [3, 2, 2, 3, 2] because all occurrences of 1 are replaced with 3.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [1].\n    - After the second query, the array is [1, 2].\n    - After the third query, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - After the fourth query, the array becomes [1, 2, 1] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 2.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [4].\n    - After the second query, the array is [4, 1].\n    - After the third query, the array is [4, 1, 4].\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - After the fifth query, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 4] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 4.\n    - After the sixth query, the array is [4, 1, 4, 3].\n    - After the seventh query, the array is [4, 1, 4, 3, 2].\n    - After the eighth query, the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 3, 7] because all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
