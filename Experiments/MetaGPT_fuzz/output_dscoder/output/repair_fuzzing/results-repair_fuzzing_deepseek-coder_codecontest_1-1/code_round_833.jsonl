{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

This approach ensures that we can handle up to 1000 test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': the arrangement of keys on a keyboard\n    'word length': the number of characters in a word\n    'efficient solution': a solution that runs quickly and uses resources effectively\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'within reasonable limits': means that the keyboard layout and word length are not excessively large, ensuring the solution can handle the input without excessive time or space complexity.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest or least amount of time required to complete a task\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    For each test case:\n    1.

Calculate the time based on the distance between the current and previous character positions.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    search([1,2,3,4,5]) = 3\n    Explanation: The list contains integers that are all more than zero, and the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3.\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1,1,2,2,3,3]) = -1\n    Explanation: The list contains integers that are all more than zero, but no integer appears at least as many times as itself.\n    Edge case 3:\n    search([1]) = 1\n    Explanation: The list contains only one positive integer, which is 1 and appears once, meeting the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can directly check if the list is empty or contains only one element and return the appropriate result.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for a solution that can handle multiple test cases efficiently, with each test case involving a keyboard layout and a word to be typed. The solution must be optimized for both time and space complexity to ensure it can handle up to 1000 test cases without performance issues.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the minimal typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard.\n- Ensure the solution can handle up to 1000 test cases efficiently.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.\n- Optimize the solution for both time and space complexity.\nWe will use Python for the implementation as it provides efficient handling of string operations and can easily manage the input/output requirements. The solution will involve a function that calculates the minimal typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard. We will optimize the solution by considering edge cases and ensuring it scales well with increasing input sizes.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': the arrangement of keys on a keyboard\n    'word length': the number of characters in a word\n    'efficient handling': optimizing the solution to run quickly and use resources effectively\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'within reasonable limits': means that the keyboard layout and word length are not excessively large, ensuring the solution can handle them efficiently\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest amount of time required to type the word\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    For each test case:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word.\n    2. Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total typing time.\n    4. Iterate through each character in the word, calculate the time to type the character based on its position on the keyboard, and add it to the total typing time.\n    5. Print the total typing time for the word.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"abc\"\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: Each character in the word \"abc\" is at position 1, 2, and 3 on the keyboard, so the total typing time is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\"\n    word = \"hello\"\n    Expected output: 52\n    Explanation: The positions of each character in \"hello\" on the given keyboard are 16, 22, 15, 22, and 15, respectively. The total typing time is 16 + 22 + 15 + 22 + 15 = 52.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"zzz\"\n    Expected output: 26 * 3 = 78\n    Explanation: Since 'z' is the last key on the keyboard, typing 'z' three times will require moving the hand from 'a' to 'z' three times, resulting in a total typing time of 26 * 3 = 78.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
