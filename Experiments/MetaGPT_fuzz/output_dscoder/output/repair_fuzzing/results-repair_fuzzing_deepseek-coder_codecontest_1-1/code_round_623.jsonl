{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves calculating the mean of the array, iterating through pairs of indices, and checking if deleting the elements at these indices maintains the original mean. The constraints include a maximum of 10^4 test cases, each with up to 2 \u22c5 10^5 elements, so the solution must be optimized for performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of indices and check if deleting the elements results in the mean remaining unchanged.\n- Optimize the solution to handle up to 2 \u22c5 10^5 elements efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is user-friendly and provides clear feedback on the number of valid pairs.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and calculations. We will iterate through each test case, calculate the mean of the array, and then find all pairs of indices whose deletion does not change the mean. We will use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of indices and check the condition.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mathematic mean is a fundamental statistical measure that represents the central tendency of a set of numbers. In this context, it is the sum of all elements in the array divided by the number of elements, which is a key concept for determining if deleting two elements will affect this mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of indices whose deletion does not change the mean.\n    Explanation: This phrase is crucial as it specifies the condition under which a pair of elements can be deleted without altering the mathematic mean of the remaining elements.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': means that the mathematic mean of the remaining elements should be the same as the original mean.\n    Explanation: This adverb is important because it sets the target value (the mathematic mean) that the remaining elements' mean must match after the deletion of two elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps for each test case:\n    1. Calculate the original mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at indices i and j.\n    4. Count the number of pairs that result in the new mean being equal to the original mean.\n    5. Output the count of such pairs for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 3\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3. Deleting any pair of elements that sum to 6 (e.g., [1, 5], [2, 4]) will result in a mean of 3.\n    search([1, 1, 1, 1]) = 6\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+1+1+1)/4 = 1.
