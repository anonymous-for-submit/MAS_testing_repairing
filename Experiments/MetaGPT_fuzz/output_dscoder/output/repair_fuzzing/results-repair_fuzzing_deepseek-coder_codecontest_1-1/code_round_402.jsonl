Removing any element will not change this, so the maximum f(a) remains 0.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 1, a = [1]\n    expected output: 1\n    Explanation: Since there's only one element, removing it will make f(a) = 1 (since the remaining sequence is empty).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 5, a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n    expected output: 3\n    Explanation: The initial value of f(a) is 0.
