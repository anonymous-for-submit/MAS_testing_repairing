{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The solution should be efficient, handle edge cases, and scale well with increasing input sizes. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a keyboard layout and a word to be typed. The output should provide the minimal time for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the minimum typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Test the solution with a variety of inputs to validate its correctness.\nWe will use Python to implement a function that calculates the minimum typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The function will first read the number of test cases, then for each test case, it will read the keyboard layout and the word to be typed. The function will then calculate the minimum typing time by mapping the word to the keyboard layout and summing the distances between consecutive characters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key is represented by a unique character.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is a string of 26 unique lowercase Latin letters, representing the position of each key on the keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'within reasonable limits': The constraints on the keyboard layout and word length ensure that the solution runs efficiently.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the input sizes are manageable, allowing for an efficient solution.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': The goal is to find the shortest time to type the word.\n    Explanation: This adverb indicates that we need to find the minimum time required to type the word, which translates to finding the shortest path between consecutive characters on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan involves reading the input, mapping the word to the keyboard layout, and calculating the distances between consecutive characters. This can be done simultaneously for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that are all greater than zero and appear at least as many times as themselves. The largest integer that meets this condition is 3.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Similar to the previous edge case, the list contains integers that are all greater than zero and appear at least as many times as themselves.

Read the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read the keyboard layout and the word.\n    3. Create a dictionary to map each letter in the keyboard to its index.\n    4. Calculate the time required to type the word by summing the distances between consecutive letters in the word, based on the keyboard layout.\n    5. Output the calculated time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: The word \"abc\" can be typed using the given keyboard without any need to switch between keys, so the time is simply the length of the word, which is 3.\n    Expected output: 3\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"z\"\n    Explanation: The word \"z\" consists of only one letter, and since the keyboard is in alphabetical order, the time is the index of 'z' plus one (since indices start at 0), which is 25.\n    Expected output: 25\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for a solution that calculates the minimal typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard.

The largest integer that meets this condition is 3.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the integers in the list appear at least as many times as themselves.
