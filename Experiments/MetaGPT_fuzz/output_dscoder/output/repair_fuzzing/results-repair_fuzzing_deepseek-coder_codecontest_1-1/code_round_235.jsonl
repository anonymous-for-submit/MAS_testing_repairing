{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

This approach is efficient and leverages the properties of binary numbers to generate the sequence. Given the constraint that the result must be provided modulo 10^9+7, we will ensure that all calculations are performed modulo 10^9+7 to prevent overflow and ensure accuracy.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': a number that can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: A special number is formed by adding up powers of n (where n is a positive integer) without repeating any power. For example, if n = 2, then special numbers include 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), 8 (2^3), etc.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'distinct non-negative powers': means that each power of n used in the sum must be unique and non-negative.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing order': means that the special numbers should be listed in ascending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the k-th special number in increasing order, we can use the binary representation of k. For each bit in the binary representation of k, if the bit is set, it means that the corresponding power of n should be included in the sum. This approach is efficient because it directly maps the binary representation of k to the special numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains multiple numbers, and the function should return the number that appears the most times, which is 3.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Here, the function should return -1 because no number appears as many times as its value. 2 appears once, 3 appears twice, and 4 appears three times, but none of these numbers meet the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is 1. If n is 1, then the only special number is 1, regardless of k.\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        (other code)\n\n    Additionally, for very large values of k, we need to ensure that the result is calculated modulo 10^9+7 to prevent overflow and ensure accuracy.\n        result = result % (10**9 + 7)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating a program that can find the k-th special number in a sequence defined by powers of n. The program must handle large inputs and ensure the result is accurate modulo 10^9+7. Edge cases to consider include when n is 1 or when k is very large. The solution should be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations to ensure performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the algorithm to find special numbers.\n- Ensure the program can handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Implement modulo 10^9+7 for large number handling.\n- Test the program for edge cases, especially when n is 1 or k is very large.\n- Optimize the algorithm to reduce computational complexity.\nTo solve the problem of finding the k-th special number in a sequence defined by powers of n, we will use a mathematical approach based on the concept of binary representation. Each special number can be represented as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n, similar to how binary numbers represent integers in base-2. We will leverage this analogy to generate the sequence efficiently. The program will read multiple test cases, each with a pair of integers n and k, and output the k-th special number modulo 10^9+7 for each test case. The algorithm will be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently, ensuring that the solution is robust against large values of k.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': a number that can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: This concept involves understanding that any number can be represented in base-n using only the digits 0 and 1, similar to binary but with base-n. For example, in base-4, the number 17 can be represented as 10001 (which is 4^4 + 4^0).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find special numbers greater than zero.\n    Explanation: In the context of special numbers, 'more than' refers to numbers that can be formed by summing distinct non-negative powers of n.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the biggest special number.\n    Explanation: In the context of special numbers, 'largest' refers to the special number with the highest value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the k-th special number, we can use a mathematical approach based on the concept of binary representation. Each special number can be represented as a sum of distinct non-negative powers of n, similar to how binary numbers represent integers in base-2. We will leverage this analogy to generate the sequence efficiently.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1], 1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence contains only one number, which is 1, and since k=1, the output should be 1.\n    search([2], 1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence for n=2 is [1], and since k=1, the output should be 1.\n    search([3], 1) = 1\n    Explanation: The sequence for n=3 is [1], and since k=1, the output should be 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The sequence for n=1 is [1], and since k=1, the output should be 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where n is 1, as the sequence would be [1] and there would be no special numbers greater than zero. The function should return 1 for k=1 in this case.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 235, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 184}
