The solution will be optimized to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'list manipulation': understanding how to add and modify elements in a list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': means to replace all occurrences of a specific value with another value\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'most': means to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - For query type '1 x': Append 'x' to the list.\n    - For query type '2 x y': Replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2, 6) = [1, 6, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: The number 2 is replaced with 6 in the list.\n    \n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 4) = [1, 4, 4, 3, 3]\n    Explanation: All occurrences of 2 are replaced with 4 in the list.\n    \n    Edge case 3:\n    search([], 1, 2) = []\n    Explanation: The list is empty, so no substitution can occur.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic for replacing elements in the list is already sufficient to handle cases where the element to be replaced does not exist in the list.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 636, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
