The list will be dynamically updated based on the queries. For each replacement query, we will iterate through the list and replace all occurrences of the specified element with the new element.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': adding elements and replacing occurrences\n\n    Explanation: The core concepts involve managing a list of integers and performing operations to add elements and replace specific values within the list.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integers greater than a certain value\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find integers whose occurrences are greater than or equal to their value\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the largest integer that meets a certain condition\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the queries efficiently, we can use a list to store the array and a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element. For each query of type \"2 x y\", we will iterate through the list and replace all occurrences of x with y.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: \n    1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array initially has elements [1, 2]. After the replacement query, all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: \n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: \n    1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After the first query, the array becomes [4]. After adding 1 and 4, the array is [4, 1, 4]. Replacing all 1s with 4 results in [4, 4, 4]. Adding another 2 and 4, the array becomes [4, 4, 4, 2, 4]. Replacing all 4s with 3 results in [3, 3, 3, 2, 3]. Adding another 2, the array becomes [3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2]. Replacing all 2s with 7 results in [3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
