The function f(a) calculates the number of elements where the value equals its index in the sequence.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we are given a sequence a indexed from 1 to n, and we need to find the largest possible f(a) by removing zero or more elements.

After iterating through the sequence, the counter will represent the initial value of f(a).\n    6. To maximize f(a), we need to consider removing elements that do not satisfy the condition a_i = i.

The optimal strategy would be to remove elements until we are left with a sequence where all elements satisfy the condition. The largest possible f(a) in this case would be 1, achieved by removing elements until only one element remains that satisfies the condition.\n    Edge Case 3:\n    Input: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n    Explanation: In this case, we need to remove elements to maximize f(a). The optimal strategy would be to remove the elements at indices 2 and 4 (values 3 and 5), leaving the sequence [1, 2, 4].
