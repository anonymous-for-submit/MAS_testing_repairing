{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each letter has a time cost based on its position relative to the previous letter. The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type each letter based on the keyboard layout.\n- Create a loop to iterate through the word and calculate the total time.\n- Ensure the solution can handle multiple test cases.\n- Optimize the code for performance to handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The approach involves creating a function that calculates the time to type a word based on a given keyboard layout. We will use a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard. The time to type each letter will be determined by the absolute difference in positions between consecutive letters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': Each key on the keyboard represents a distinct lowercase Latin letter, and the position of each letter is fixed.\n    'absolute difference': The time to type a letter is determined by the distance between its position on the keyboard and the position of the previous letter typed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the total time to type a word, we need to:\n    1.

Iterate through the word, calculating the time to type each letter based on the position of the current letter and the position of the previous letter.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Typing a word with only one letter.\n    calculate_time(\"a\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\") = 0\n    Explanation: Since there's only one letter, there's no time to type the previous letter.\n\n    Edge case 2: Typing a word with consecutive letters on the keyboard.\n    calculate_time(\"bc\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\") = 1\n    Explanation: The time to type 'b' is 1 (position 2 - position 1), and the time to type 'c' is 1 (position 3 - position 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: Typing a word with non-consecutive letters on the keyboard.\n    calculate_time(\"az\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\") = 1\n    Explanation: The time to type 'a' is 0 (position 1 - position 1), and the time to type 'z' is 25 (position 26 - position 1).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the word to be typed is also provided as a string. The challenge is to determine the positions of each letter on the keyboard and calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters in the word. The algorithm should be efficient to handle up to 1000 test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time required to type a word on a given keyboard.\n- Ensure the algorithm is optimized for handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting the keyboard layout and the word to be typed.\n- Include error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.\n- Allow users to input multiple test cases and receive results for each.\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.
