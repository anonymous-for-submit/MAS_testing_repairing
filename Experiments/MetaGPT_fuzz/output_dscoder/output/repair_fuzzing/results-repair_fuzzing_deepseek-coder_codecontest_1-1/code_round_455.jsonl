{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This requires summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then iterating through pairs to check if their deletion maintains the mean. The solution must handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements across multiple test cases, making efficiency crucial.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] and check if deleting the elements at these positions maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements efficiently.\n- Add support for multiple test cases.\n- Improve user interface for better user experience.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in libraries and data structures. The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find all pairs [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions maintains the mean. We will use a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs and check the condition. To optimize the solution for large inputs, we will ensure that the function is optimized for performance and uses minimal memory.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'average' (mean)\n    The average (mean) of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we need to find the average of the entire array and then determine how many pairs of elements can be removed such that the remaining elements' average is still equal to this value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times'\n    This phrase indicates that the number of times a value appears in the array should be at least equal to the value itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest'\n    This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the average (mean) of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, check if removing the elements at these positions maintains the mean of the remaining elements equal to the calculated average.\n    4. Count and return the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The average of the array is (1+2+3)/3 = 2. There are no pairs that can be removed to maintain the mean of 2 since removing any two elements will change the mean.\n    Expected output: 0\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: n = 4, array = [1, 3, 2, 4]\n    Explanation: The average of the array is (1+3+2+4)/4 = 2.5.
