We will also use a simple loop to process each query in sequence. For the replace operation, we will use the list's `remove` and `append` methods to remove all instances of the target value and then append the replacement value.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing an array (list in Python) by appending elements and replacing specific values within the array.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty list, where operations can either append an element to the end of the list or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates the number of elements in the array after all operations are performed.\n    'at least as many times': Refers to the condition for replacement in the replace operation.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Not applicable in this context as there is no explicit mention of finding the largest element.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests processing each query sequentially, which means we can handle each query one by one without needing to consider them simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n        Input: 7\n        1 3\n        1 1\n        2 1 2\n        1 2\n        1 1\n        1 2\n        2 1 3\n        Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n        Explanation: The array starts empty. After each query, the array's state is as follows:\n            - After query \"1 3\": [3]\n            - After query \"1 1\": [3, 1]\n            - After query \"2 1 2\": [3, 2] (since 1 is replaced with 2)\n            - After query \"1 2\": [3, 2, 2]\n            - After query \"1 1\": [3, 2, 2, 1]\n            - After query \"1 2\": [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n            - After query \"2 1 3\": [3, 2, 2, 3, 2] (since 1 is replaced with 3)\n\n    Edge case 2:\n        Input: 4\n        1 1\n        1 2\n        1 1\n        2 2 2\n        Output: 1 2 1\n        Explanation: The array starts empty. After each query, the array's state is as follows:\n            - After query \"1 1\": [1]\n            - After query \"1 2\": [1, 2]\n            - After query \"1 1\": [1, 2, 1]\n            - After query \"2 2 2\": [1, 2, 1] (since 2 is replaced with 2, no change)\n\n    Edge case 3:\n        Input: 8\n        2 1 4\n        1 1\n        1 4\n        1 2\n        2 2 4\n        2 4 3\n        1 2\n        2 2 7\n        Output: 1 3 3 7\n        Explanation: The array starts empty. After each query, the array's state is as follows:\n            - After query \"2 1 4\": [4] (since 1 is replaced with 4)\n            - After query \"1 1\": [4, 1]\n            - After query \"1 4\": [4, 1, 4]\n            - After query \"1 2\": [4, 1, 4, 2]\n            - After query \"2 2 4\": [4, 1, 4, 4] (since 2 is replaced with 4)\n            - After query \"2 4 3\": [4, 1, 4, 3] (since 4 is replaced with 3)\n            - After query \"1 2\": [4, 1, 4, 3, 2]\n            - After query \"2 2 7\": [4, 1, 4, 3, 7] (since 2 is replaced with 7)\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
