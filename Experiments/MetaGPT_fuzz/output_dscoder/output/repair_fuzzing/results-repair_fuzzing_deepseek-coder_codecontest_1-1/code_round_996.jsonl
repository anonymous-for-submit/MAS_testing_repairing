Define f(a) as the number of indices where a_i = i. You can pick an element from the current sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements together. For example, if you remove the 3-rd element from the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the resulting sequence will be [4, 2, 1]. You want to remove some elements from a in order to maximize f(a), using zero or more operations. Find the largest possible f(a). Consider how removing specific elements affects the alignment between index and value to maximize meaningful matches.
