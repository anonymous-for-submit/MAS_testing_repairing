This can be achieved by potentially removing elements from the sequence.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find indices where a_i > i or a_i < i, depending on whether we are looking for values greater than or less than the index.\n    'at least as many times': not directly applicable in this context as we are looking for specific index-value equality.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not directly applicable in this context as we are looking for the maximum count of index-value equality, not the largest individual value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1.
