{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. The order of the arrangement is fixed and does not change for different test cases. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Clearly mention assumptions and constraints in the solution. Assume that the arrangement of the keys on the keyboard does not change between different test cases. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a predefined keyboard layout.

We will also handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The fixed order of 26 keys each corresponding to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    'word typing': The process of typing a word by consecutively pressing the keys corresponding to each letter.\n    'position difference': The absolute value of the difference between the positions of the keys corresponding to two letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: The positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The time taken to type each letter is the absolute value of the difference between their positions, which is 0 for consecutive letters. Therefore, the total time is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n    Expected output: 0\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno\"\n    word = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: The positions of 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o' are 11, 5, 12, 12, and 15 respectively on the given keyboard. The time taken to type each letter is the absolute value of the difference between their positions:\n    - 'h' to 'e': |11 - 5| = 6\n    - 'e' to 'l': |5 - 12| = 7\n    - 'l' to 'l': |12 - 12| = 0\n    - 'l' to 'o': |12 - 15| = 3\n    - 'o' to 'w': |15 - 23| = 8\n    Therefore, the total time is 6 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 8 = 24.\n    Expected output: 24\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\"\n    word = \"code\"\n    Explanation: The positions of 'c', 'o', 'd', and 'e' are 17, 15, 4, and 5 respectively. The time taken to type each letter is:\n    - 'c' to 'o': |17 - 15| = 2\n    - 'o' to 'd': |15 - 4| = 11\n    - 'd' to 'e': |4 - 5| = 1\n    Therefore, the total time is 2 + 11 + 1 = 14.\n    Expected output: 14\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
