The function should return 1 as it is the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already handles the case where the array is empty and where all elements are the same.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for a program that can handle two types of queries on an initially empty array: appending an element and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element. The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries, up to 5 * 10^5, and must correctly manage edge cases such as an empty array or an element not present in the array.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to append elements to an array\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array\n- Ensure the program can handle large datasets efficiently\n- Implement robust error handling for edge cases\nTo efficiently handle the requirements, we will use a Python list to represent the array, which allows for dynamic appending and modification. We will iterate through each query, applying the operations as specified. For the '2 x y' query, we will use list comprehension to replace all occurrences of x with y. This approach ensures that the solution is both simple and efficient, suitable for handling large datasets.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': understanding how to append and replace elements in a list dynamically.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing an array (list) where elements can be added and modified.
