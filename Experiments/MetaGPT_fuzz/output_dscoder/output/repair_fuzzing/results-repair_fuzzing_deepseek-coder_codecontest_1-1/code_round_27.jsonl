The program must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries (up to 5 * 10^5). The output should reflect the final state of the array after all operations.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to append elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final state of the array.\nTo efficiently handle the operations on the array, we will use a list to store the elements. For the query operations, we will implement two functions: one to append an element to the array and another to replace all occurrences of a specific element with another element. We will ensure that the program can handle a large number of queries efficiently by using Python's built-in list operations, which are optimized for such tasks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves appending elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array based on given queries.\n    Explanation: This requires understanding how to handle dynamic data structures like lists in Python, specifically for operations like appending and replacing elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of elements in the array will exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': Refers to the frequency of an element in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the need to find the largest element in the array.\n    'greatest': Refers to the highest frequency of an element in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the operations, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the list.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the list.\n    5. Return the final list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, then we append 3, 1, then replace all 1s with 2s, append 2, 1, and finally replace all 1s with 3s.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, then we append 1, 2, and 1 again.
