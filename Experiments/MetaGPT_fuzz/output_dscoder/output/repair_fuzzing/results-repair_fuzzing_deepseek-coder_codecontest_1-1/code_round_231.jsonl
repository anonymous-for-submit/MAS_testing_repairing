{"name": "1619_B. Squares and Cubes", "description": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, ....\n\nFor a given number n, count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 20) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThen t lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the answer you are looking for \u2014 the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10\n1\n25\n1000000000\n999999999\n500000000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n6\n32591\n32590\n23125", "tags": ["implementation", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1619,
