{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need. \n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears twice, which is more than its value, and 3 appears once, which is less than its value. The largest number that meets the condition is 2.\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3\n    Explanation: The number 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value. No other number meets the condition.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1\n    Explanation: None of the numbers appear more than or equal to their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where no such integer exists.\n        result = -1\n        for num, freq in frequency.items():\n            if freq >= num:\n                result = max(result, num)\n        return result\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions maintains the arithmetic mean of the array. The solution must handle edge cases, such as arrays with all identical elements, and must be optimized for large inputs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the arithmetic mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of positions [i, j] that, when deleted, maintain the arithmetic mean.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs to ensure it runs efficiently within the given constraints.\n- Handle edge cases, such as arrays with all identical elements, to ensure the solution is robust.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in data structures and libraries to ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs. We will calculate the arithmetic mean of the array and then find pairs of positions [i, j] that, when deleted, maintain the arithmetic mean. We will handle edge cases by considering arrays with all identical elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'arithmetic mean': The sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The arithmetic mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that a certain condition must be met in terms of the number of times an element appears compared to its value.\n    'at least as many times': Indicates that the frequency of an element must be at least equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the sought-after element should be the biggest in the array.\n    Explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself means finding the biggest number in the array that has a frequency equal to or greater than its value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through the array to count the frequency of each element.\n    3. Check which elements appear at least as many times as themselves.\n    4. Find pairs [i, j] where deleting elements at these positions maintains the arithmetic mean.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: All elements in the array are the same.\n    search([5, 5, 5, 5]) = -1\n    Explanation: Since all elements are the same, no single element can be deleted to maintain the mean. The function should return -1.\n\n    Edge case 2: The array has two elements that must be removed to maintain the mean.\n    search([1, 3, 2, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation: The arithmetic mean is (1+3+2+4)/4 = 2.5. Removing elements at positions 1 and 3 (0-indexed) or positions 2 and 3 will maintain the mean of 2.5.\n\n    Edge case 3: The array has a single element that must be removed to maintain the mean.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The arithmetic mean is (2+2+4+4)/4 = 3. Removing any one of the elements will maintain the mean of 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where all elements are the same or where the array has a single element that must be removed to maintain the mean.\n    For edge case 1:\n        if all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n            return -1\n    For edge case 2 and 3:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                if (sum(a[:i] + a[i+1:j] + a[j+1:]) / (n-2)) == k:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, false, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 648, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 481}
