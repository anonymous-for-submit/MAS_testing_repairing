{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find all pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting these elements maintains the mean. We will optimize the solution to handle large inputs by avoiding unnecessary computations and leveraging Python's efficient list operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': The average value of a set of numbers.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the mathematic mean (average) of the array elements is calculated by dividing the sum of all elements by the number of elements in the array. Monocarp wants to delete two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains the same.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'divided by': Indicates division in the formula for calculating the mathematic mean.\n    Explanation: The mathematic mean is calculated as the sum of elements divided by the number of elements (sum / n).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': Indicates that the mathematic mean of the remaining elements should match the original mean after deletion.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the mean of the remaining elements after deleting two positions should still be equal to the original mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1.
