{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. The order of the arrangement is fixed. This order does not change for different test cases. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Clearly mention assumptions and constraints in the solution. Assume that the word s is non-empty and its maximum length is 10^5 characters. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.

The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.

The time for each letter will be the absolute difference between the positions of the current and previous letters.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we have a keyboard with 26 keys, each key representing a different lowercase Latin letter. We need to calculate the time to type a given word based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'non-empty': Indicates that the word has at least one letter.\n    Explanation: The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive, meaning it cannot be empty.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Refers to the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: We aim to find the minimal time required to type the word, considering the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the time to type each letter in the word based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search('abc', 'bca') = 3\n    Explanation: The positions of the letters on the keyboard are: a=1, b=2, c=3. The time to type 'bca' is |2-1| + |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n    search('aaa', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: The positions of the letters on the keyboard are: a=1. The time to type 'a' is 0 since the hand does not need to move.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already handles the case where the word consists of a single letter.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time required to type a given word on a keyboard where each key corresponds to a unique letter.
