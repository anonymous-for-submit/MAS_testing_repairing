The main challenge is to maximize the function f(a), which counts the number of indices where a_i equals i. We will iterate through the sequence, remove elements, and check the value of f(a) after each removal to find the maximum possible value.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence manipulation': involves changing the order or elements of a sequence to achieve a desired outcome.\n    'combinatorial optimization': involves finding the best possible solution from a set of possible solutions, often using a brute-force approach.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'zero or more operations': means that the operations can be performed any number of times, including zero.\n    'various combinations': means that all possible combinations of elements to be removed need to be considered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest possible': means that we need to find the maximum value of f(a) that can be obtained.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
