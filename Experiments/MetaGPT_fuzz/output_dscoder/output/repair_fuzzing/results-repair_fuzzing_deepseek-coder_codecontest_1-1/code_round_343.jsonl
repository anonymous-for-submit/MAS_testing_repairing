{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then checking all possible pairs to see if their deletion maintains the mean.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through all pairs of positions and check if their deletion maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs within the given constraints.\n- Ensure the output is accurate and matches the expected result for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations. The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find all pairs of positions that, when deleted, maintain the mean. We will use a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible pairs and check the condition. This approach is simple and should work well within the given constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mean': the average value of a set of numbers. In this case, it refers to the arithmetic mean of the array elements.\n    Explanation: The mean (average) of an array is calculated by summing all the elements and dividing by the number of elements. Monocarp wants to delete two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred from the context that we need to find pairs of positions where deleting two elements will not change the mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This phrase is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred that we need to find the largest possible pairs that maintain the mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. Check if deleting the elements at these positions will maintain the mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3. If we delete any pair of elements, the mean will change.

Let's denote k as the mean of these elements (note that k might not be an integer). The average of an array with n items is the total of its elements divided by the count of these items. This means it is equal to the total divided by n. Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a). Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).

The challenge lies in optimizing this process for large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through all pairs of indices and check their removal effect on the mean.\n- Optimize the function to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is clear and easy to understand.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair iteration. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all possible pairs of indices to check if their removal will maintain the mean. The key is to ensure that the solution is optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mean': the average value of a set of numbers. In this case, the mean k is the average of all elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mean is calculated by summing all the elements in the array and then dividing by the number of elements. Monocarp wants to delete two elements from the array such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to k.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but the concept of 'greater than' is implied when we talk about the mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This phrase is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement, but the concept of 'largest integer' is implied when we talk about the mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, check if removing the elements at these indices will keep the mean of the remaining elements equal to k.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: The mean k is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3. If we remove any pair of elements, the mean of the remaining elements will not be equal to 3.\n    Expected output: 0\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n    Explanation: The mean k is 5. Any pair of elements can be removed, and the mean of the remaining elements will still be 5.\n    Expected output: 10\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases where the array elements are equal. However, for the edge case where all elements are the same, we can optimize the counting of pairs by using the combination formula nC2 (n choose 2) where n is the number of elements.\n\n# [code logic continued]\n    For each pair (i, j), we need to check if the sum of the remaining elements (excluding a_i and a_j) divided by (n - 2) equals k. This can be done by iterating through the array and summing the elements while skipping a_i and a_j.\n\n# [extra code for edge case continued]\n    For the edge case where all elements are the same, we can use the combination formula nC2 to directly calculate the number of pairs.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 343, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 268}
