You want to remove some elements from a in order to maximize f(a), using zero or more operations. Find the largest possible f(a). Consider the initial sequence carefully to determine the optimal elements to remove.

We can remove at most one element from the sequence to achieve this maximum.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find elements in the sequence where the value is greater than the index.\n    Explanation: For example, in the sequence `[2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7]`, the element `7` satisfies the condition `a_i == i` because `7 == 7`.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means we need to find the maximum value of `f(a)` after potentially removing one element.\n    Explanation: We need to maximize the count of elements where `a_i == i` by removing at most one element from the sequence.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1.

However, if we remove the element at index 0 (value 4), the sequence becomes `[1, 2, 2, 3, 1]` with `f(a) = 3`.
