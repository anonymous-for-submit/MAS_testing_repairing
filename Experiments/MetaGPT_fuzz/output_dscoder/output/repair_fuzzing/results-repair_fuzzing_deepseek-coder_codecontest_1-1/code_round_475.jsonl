{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This requires careful handling of mean calculations and efficient iteration through pairs of elements. The solution must also be robust against edge cases, such as arrays with very large or very small numbers, or arrays with a small number of elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] and check if deleting the elements at these positions results in the same mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is robust against edge cases.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in libraries and data structures. The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find all pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions results in the remaining elements having the same mean. We will optimize the solution to handle large inputs efficiently by avoiding unnecessary computations and leveraging Python's efficient itertools for pair generation.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': The average value of a set of numbers.

Deleting the first and third elements (1 and 2) results in [3, 3] with a mean of 3, which is equal to k. Similarly, deleting the second and fourth elements (3 and 3) results in [1, 2] with a mean of 1.5, which is not equal to k.
