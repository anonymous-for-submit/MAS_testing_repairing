{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\".\n\nDetermine how much time it will require to type the word s.

We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the keys for quick lookup.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, each representing a key. The goal is to calculate the time required to type a word using this specific keyboard layout.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of times a letter appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the phrase 'appears at least as many times' refers to the frequency of an integer in a list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the maximum or greatest value among a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the degree adverb 'largest' specifies that we need to find the largest integer with the given property.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Iterate through the word and calculate the time required to type each letter based on the positions of the current and previous letters on the keyboard.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this test case, the list contains integers that appear at least as many times as themselves. The integer 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value, making it the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this test case, the list contains integers that do not all appear at least as many times as themselves. For example, the integer 2 appears only twice, which is less than its value. Therefore, no integer meets the condition, and the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the minimum time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.
