{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The logic for counting pairs is straightforward and does not require additional complexity for this specific edge case.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. This requires iterating through the array, calculating the mean, and then checking pairs of elements to see if their deletion maintains the mean. The challenge lies in optimizing this process for large inputs within the given constraints.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through pairs of positions and check if their deletion maintains the mean.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Add input validation to handle edge cases.\n- Include error handling for unexpected input.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to calculate the mean of the array and iterate through pairs of positions. We will avoid using complex data structures and algorithms to ensure the solution is simple and optimized for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': The average value of a set of numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the mathematic mean (average) of the array is calculated by dividing the sum of all elements by the number of elements in the array.
