The efficiency of the solution is crucial, especially with the potential for a large number of queries. Edge cases such as replacing a non-existent element should also be considered to ensure robustness.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle the list operations.\n- Ensure that the application can handle a large number of queries.\n- Implement error handling for cases where an element to be replaced does not exist in the list.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\nTo efficiently handle the list of integers and perform the required operations, we will use Python's built-in list data structure. For the query operations, we will iterate through each query and perform the necessary actions based on the type of query. For the replace operation, we will use a simple loop to replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element. We will also ensure that the application can handle a large number of queries by optimizing the replace operation to avoid unnecessary iterations through the list.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'list manipulation': understanding how to add and modify elements in a list\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times as': indicates the frequency of an element's occurrence in the list\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more than': specifies the minimum frequency an element must meet to be considered\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - For query type \"1 x\": Append the integer x to the list.\n    - For query type \"2 x y\": Replace every instance of x with y in the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The list contains 3 which appears at least 3 times, which is more than any other number.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The list contains 4 which appears 3 times, but 5 appears 2 times, and no number appears more than itself.
