To ensure efficiency, we will use list methods that operate in O(n) time complexity for both addition and replacement operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': a data structure that can grow or shrink in size as needed, allowing for efficient addition and removal of elements.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, we need to handle a sequence of operations where elements are added to the array and specific elements are replaced. The array needs to dynamically change size as new elements are added.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the array size increases with each addition.\n    'replace all occurrences': means that every instance of a specified element in the array will be replaced with another element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not relate to the dynamic nature of the array or the replacement operation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - For each query of type \"1 x\", append the element x to the end of the array.\n    - For each query of type \"2 x y\", iterate through the array and replace all occurrences of x with y.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output:\n    1 2 1\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - The query \"2 2 2\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1] unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output:\n    1 3 3 7\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [4].\n    - After adding 1, 4, and 2, the array is [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - The query \"2 2 4\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in [4, 1, 4, 4].\n    - The query \"2 4 3\" replaces all occurrences of 4 with 3, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 3].\n    - Adding another 2 results in [3, 1, 3, 3, 2].\n    - The final query \"2 2 7\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 7, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
