{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The constraints are that the number of test cases (t) is between 1 and 10,000, and the number of elements in the array (n) is between 3 and 200,000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find all pairs [i, j] where i < j.\n- Ensure the function checks if deleting the elements at positions [i, j] maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the function to handle large datasets efficiently.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair checking.

Calculate the average of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, check if removing these two elements results in the average of the remaining elements being equal to the original average.\n    4. Count and return the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 0\n    explanation: No pair of elements can be removed to maintain the average since the average of the array is 3, and no two elements sum up to 6 (which is 2 * 3).\n    search([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) = 10\n    explanation: Any pair of elements can be removed since all elements are equal. There are 5 choose 2 = 10 possible pairs.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic to count pairs is straightforward and does not require additional complexity for this specific edge case.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, false, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 410, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 11}
