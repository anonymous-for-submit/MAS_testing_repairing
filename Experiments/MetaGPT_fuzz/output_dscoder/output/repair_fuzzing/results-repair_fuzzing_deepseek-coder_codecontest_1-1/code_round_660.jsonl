For each query of type \"1 x\", we will append the element x to the end of the list. For each query of type \"2 x y\", we will iterate through the list and replace all occurrences of x with y. We will ensure that each query is processed in constant time, O(1), which is efficient for handling a high volume of queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n\n    Output: \n    1 2 1\n\n    Explanation: In this case, we add elements 1 and 2 to the array, followed by another 1. Then, we replace all occurrences of 2 with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: \n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n\n    Output: \n    1 3 3 7\n\n    Explanation: Initially, we replace all occurrences of 1 with 4, then add 1, 4, and 2 to the array. Next, we replace all occurrences of 2 with 4, then 4 with 3. Finally, we add another 2 and replace all occurrences of 2 with 7, resulting in the array [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this plan, as the provided logic already accounts for the absence of elements and the replacement of elements efficiently.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 660, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
