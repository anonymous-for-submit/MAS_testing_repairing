{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the word to be typed is also provided as a string. The program must handle multiple test cases efficiently. The primary challenge is to map the letters of the keyboard to their positions and calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters in the word.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word based on the keyboard layout.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure the program can handle any random order of the keyboard layout.\n- Optimize the program for speed and efficiency, especially for long words and multiple test cases.\nWe will implement a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a custom keyboard layout. The function will first map each key to its position on the keyboard, then calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters in the word. The function will handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key represents a different character.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to calculate the time taken to type a word based on the positions of the keys on the keyboard. The position of each key is determined by its order in the sequence of the keyboard string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of times a character appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, if a character appears twice in the word, it means we need to consider the time taken to move the hand between these two positions.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Indicates the smallest or shortest time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: We need to find the minimal time to type the word, considering the positions of the keys on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Create a dictionary to map each character to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. For each test case, calculate the time to type the word by summing the absolute differences between the positions of consecutive letters.\n    3.

To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively, one by one, positioning your hand exactly over the corresponding key and pressing it, and moving the hand between the keys takes time equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right), with no time spent on pressing the keys or on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, imagine a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' lie in ordered alphabetical sequence; the letters 'h', 'e', 'l', and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12, and 15, respectively, so it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello.\" Determine how long it will take to print the word s, and clearly mention assumptions and constraints in the solution. Your solution should efficiently handle scenarios where the sequence of characters on the keyboard is given in any random order.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively, one by one, positioning your hand exactly over the corresponding key and pressing it, and moving the hand between the keys takes time equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right), with no time spent on pressing the keys or on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, imagine a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' lie in ordered alphabetical sequence; the letters 'h', 'e', 'l', and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12, and 15, respectively, so it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello.\" Determine how long it will take to print the word s, and clearly mention assumptions and constraints in the solution.
