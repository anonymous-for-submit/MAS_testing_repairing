{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The program must handle multiple test cases efficiently. The input includes a keyboard layout and a word, and the output should provide the minimal typing time for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the typing time for a word on a given keyboard.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure the program can handle a keyboard layout of 26 unique lowercase Latin letters.\n- Allow words with a length from 1 to 50 characters.\n- Optimize the solution for up to 1000 test cases.\nWe will implement a Python function that calculates the minimal typing time for a given word on a specific keyboard. The function will read input from the console, process the data, and output the results to the console. To ensure efficiency, we will use a simple and direct approach without complex data structures or optimizations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': the arrangement of keys on a keyboard\n    'word length': the number of characters in a word\n    'minimal time': the shortest amount of time required to type a word\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    For each test case:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word.\n    2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total typing time.\n    3. Iterate through each character in the word.\n    4. For each character, find its position in the keyboard layout.\n    5. Add the position's distance to the total typing time.\n    6.
