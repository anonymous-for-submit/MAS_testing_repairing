{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The goal is to reach the destination without falling into trap cells.\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2xN matrix, and Monocarp starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). He can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, and '0' represents a safe cell while '1' represents a trap cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm starting from (1, 1) and exploring all possible paths to (2, n). We will use a queue to keep track of the current position and the steps taken to reach there. We will also maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting the same cell.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1:\n    Input:\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (1, 3) and then to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge Case 2:\n    Input:\n    4\n    0011\n    1100\n    Output: YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (1, 3) to (2, 3) and then to (2, 4) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge Case 3:\n    Input:\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Output: NO\n    Explanation: There is no way for Monocarp to reach (2, 4) without falling into the trap at (1, 4).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the BFS algorithm inherently handles edge cases like starting and ending positions being safe.

The game is a 2-row, n-column grid where the player needs to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without falling into trap cells.

The BFS will help us explore all possible paths from the starting point (1, 1) to the goal (2, n) while avoiding trap cells.

The character '0' represents a safe cell, and '1' represents a trap cell. The goal is to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without landing on a trap cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).

Read the number of columns.\n        b. Read the two rows of the grid.\n        c. Use BFS to check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without landing on a trap cell.\n        d.

The character '0' represents a safe cell. Since (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe, a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n    Expected output: YES\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    n = 4\n    0011\n    1100\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x4 grid with some trap cells. The character '1' represents a trap cell. Although (1, 1) is safe, (2, n) is not because it's blocked by a trap cell. Therefore, no path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n    Expected output: NO\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases since the BFS algorithm inherently checks all possible paths and avoids trap cells.

The game is a simple grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate through the grid without falling into traps. The player starts at the top-left corner and must reach the bottom-right corner. The challenge is to determine if the path is possible based on the trap placements. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid description, and the output should indicate if the level can be completed or not.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game logic to check if the path is possible\n- Handle input and output for multiple test cases\n- Ensure the game is responsive and handles edge cases\n- Design a user-friendly interface for the game\n- Implement mobile compatibility for the game\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem.

The character starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, n). The presence of traps ('1') in certain cells makes those cells unsafe.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a simple approach to check if a path exists.
