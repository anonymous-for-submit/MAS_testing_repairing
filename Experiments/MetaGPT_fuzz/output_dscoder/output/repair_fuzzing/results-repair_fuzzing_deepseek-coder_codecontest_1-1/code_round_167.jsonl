{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

The system should handle edge cases such as n=1 and very large values of k efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to generate the sequence of special numbers.\n- Ensure the sequence is sorted in increasing order.\n- Output the k-th special number modulo 10^9+7.\n- Handle edge cases where n=1 or k is very large.\n- Optimize the algorithm for efficiency and performance.\nTo solve this problem, we will use a mathematical approach to generate the sequence of special numbers. The sequence will be generated using different non-negative powers of n and sorted in increasing order. We will use Python's built-in capabilities to handle large numbers and modulo operations efficiently. The algorithm will be optimized to handle large values of k efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': A number that can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: In the context of this problem, a special number is one that can be expressed as the sum of distinct non-negative powers of a given base number \\( n \\). For example, for \\( n = 4 \\), the number 17 is special because it can be written as \\( 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17 \\).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'different non-negative powers': means that each power of n used in the sum must be unique and non-negative.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'increasing order': means that the sequence of special numbers should be sorted from smallest to largest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To generate the sequence of special numbers, we can use a mathematical approach where we sum different non-negative powers of \\( n \\) until we reach the \\( k \\)-th special number. Since \\( k \\) can be very large, we need to ensure our approach is efficient. We will use a loop to generate these numbers and a modulo operation to keep the numbers within the required range.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1], 1) = 1\n    Explanation: For \\( n = 1 \\), the only special number is 1 itself, as any power of 1 is 1. Thus, the first special number is 1.\n    search([1, 2, 4, 8, 16], 5) = -1\n    Explanation: For \\( n = 2 \\), the sequence of special numbers in increasing order is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. Since we are looking for the 5th special number, which does not exist in this sequence, the expected output is -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where \\( n = 1 \\).

For example, the binary number 101 corresponds to n^2 + n^0. We will generate these numbers and find the k-th special number in increasing order. To handle large inputs efficiently, we will use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers within the required range.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special numbers': numbers that can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: These numbers are generated by summing up different powers of the base number n, where each power is a non-negative integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find numbers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find numbers that appear a certain number of times or more.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the biggest number that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = -1\n    explanation: Since all numbers are positive and appear at least once, there is no number that appears more times than itself, so the function returns -1.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more times than themselves, but 3 is the largest number that meets the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need. \n\n# [core concept]\n    'sequences of positive integers': numbers in a sequence are generated by summing different non-negative powers of n.\n    Explanation: These sequences are generated by adding up different powers of a base number n, where each power is a non-negative integer.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find numbers greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find numbers that appear a certain number of times or more.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the biggest number that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = -1\n    explanation: Since all numbers are positive and appear at least once, there is no number that appears more times than itself, so the function returns -1.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more times than themselves, but 3 is the largest number that meets the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
