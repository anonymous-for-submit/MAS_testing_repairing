After all queries, the array becomes [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n    Edge case 2: \n        Input: 4\n        1 1\n        1 2\n        1 1\n        2 2 2\n        Output: 1 2 1\n        Explanation: The array starts empty and undergoes modifications, but since the second query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, the array remains [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 3: \n        Input: 8\n        2 1 4\n        1 1\n        1 4\n        1 2\n        2 2 4\n        2 4 3\n        1 2\n        2 2 7\n        Output: 1 3 3 7\n        Explanation: The array starts empty and undergoes several modifications, resulting in the final array [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1], 1, 1) = [1]\n    Explanation: The array initially contains only one element, which is the same as the value to be replaced. The result should be the same array.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1, 2, 3], 2, 4) = [1, 4, 3]\n    Explanation: Replace all occurrences of 2 with 4 in the array. The resulting array should be [1, 4, 3].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    search([], 1, 1) = []\n    Explanation: The array is initially empty, so replacing a non-existent element should result in an unchanged array.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers the edge cases by initializing an empty list and checking for non-existent elements.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve managing an array and performing two types of operations on it: adding an element and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another.

After processing the first query (2 1 4), the array is still empty. After adding elements 1 and 4, the array is [1, 4]. Replacing 1 with 2 results in [2, 4]. Replacing 2 with 4 results in [4, 4]. Replacing 4 with 3 results in [3, 3]. Adding another 2 results in [3, 3, 2]. Finally, replacing all 2s with 7 results in [3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle this edge case, as the provided logic already efficiently handles the operations and large input sizes.
