Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\n\n[plan]\nTo efficiently handle the dynamic array operations and replace all occurrences of a number with another number, we will use Python's built-in list data structure. The list will be used to store the elements of the array. For the query operations, we will implement two types of queries: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a number with another number. We will ensure that the operations are performed efficiently to handle large numbers of queries.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to handle a large number of queries efficiently. The application needs to be able to add integers and replace specific integers with others. The solution should be optimized for performance and should handle edge cases such as replacing non-existent elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle large number of queries.\n- Ensure that the application can handle edge cases such as replacing non-existent elements.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.\n- Provide clear feedback to the user after each operation.\n- Optimize the application for high performance and scalability.\nTo efficiently handle the large number of queries, we will use a dynamic array to store the integers. For the second type of query, we will use a hash map to keep track of the occurrences of each integer. This will allow us to replace all occurrences of a specific integer with another integer in constant time. We will also ensure that the array is dynamically resized if necessary to maintain efficient performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array': a data structure that can grow or shrink in size during runtime.\n    'hash map': a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a dynamic array to store the integers. For the second type of query, we will use a hash map to keep track of the occurrences of each integer. When processing a \"2 x y\" query, we will iterate through the array and replace all occurrences of x with y.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 3\n\n    Output:\n    1 3 1\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1]. When we process the \"2 2 3\" query, we replace all occurrences of 2 with 3, resulting in the array [1, 3, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    5\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 3\n    2 3 4\n    1 5\n\n    Output:\n    2 4 5\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing the first query, the array is [1]. After processing the \"2 1 2\" query, the array becomes [2]. After processing the \"1 3\" query, the array is [2, 3]. After processing the \"2 3 4\" query, the array becomes [2, 4]. Finally, after processing the \"1 5\" query, the array is [2, 4, 5].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    3\n    2 1 2\n    1 3\n    2 2 1\n\n    Output:\n    3 1\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing the \"2 1 2\" query, the array becomes [2]. After processing the \"1 3\" query, the array is [2, 3]. After processing the \"2 2 1\" query, the array becomes [1, 3] because we replace all occurrences of 2 with 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where we try to replace a non-existent element in the array. This can be done by checking if the element exists in the array before attempting to replace it. If the element does not exist, we can skip the replacement.\n\n    Example code:\n    if x in array:\n        array = [y if i == x else i for i in array]\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a need for a program that can handle two types of queries on an array of integers.
