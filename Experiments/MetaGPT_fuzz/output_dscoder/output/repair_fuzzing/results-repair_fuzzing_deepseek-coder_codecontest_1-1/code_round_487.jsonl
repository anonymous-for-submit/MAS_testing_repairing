You have to perform q queries. Each query is of one of two types: \"1 x\" \u2014 add the element x to the end of the array; \"2 x y\" \u2014 replace all occurrences of x in the array with y. It is necessary to locate each occurrence of x in the array and replace them with y. Find the resulting array after performing all the queries. Make sure to handle edge cases where the array remains unchanged due to the absence of the element x. Consider optimizing the solution to handle large numbers of queries efficiently.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line). Each query is of one of two types: \n  * \"1 x\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5);\n  * \"2 x y\" (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nIt's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the first type.\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line, print k integers \u2014 the resulting array after performing all the queries, where k is the number of queries of the first type.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n7\n1 3\n1 1\n2 1 2\n1 2\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1 3\n\nOutput\n\n3 2 2 3 2\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n1 1\n2 2 2\n\nOutput\n\n1 2 1\n\nInput\n\n8\n2 1 4\n1 1\n1 4\n1 2\n2 2 4\n2 4 3\n1 2\n2 2 7\n\nOutput\n\n1 3 3 7\n\n[plan]\nTo efficiently handle a large number of queries, we will use a list to store the array of integers and a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each element for efficient replacement. Each query will be processed in constant time, making the solution scalable for large numbers of queries.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements to an array and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manage an array and perform specific operations on it, such as adding elements and replacing certain values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to ensure the element exists in the array before attempting to replace it.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to replace all occurrences of the element, not just some.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the operations described in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each element.\n    3. Process each query:\n        - For query type \"1 x\", add x to the end of the array and update the dictionary.\n        - For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array and update the dictionary.\n    4. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding 1, 2, and then 1 again, we replace all occurrences of 2 with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After replacing 1 with 4, 4 with 3, and then adding 2 and 2 again, we replace all occurrences of 2 with 7, resulting in the array [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 1\n    1 5\n    Output: 5\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding 5, the resulting array is [5].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle all cases efficiently.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a need for an array manipulation tool that can handle two types of queries: adding an element and replacing occurrences of an element with another. The system should be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries, which implies the need for optimization. Edge cases such as when an element to be replaced is not present in the array should also be handled.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement functionality to add elements to the array.\n- Implement functionality to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system can handle large numbers of queries efficiently.\n- Optimize the system to handle edge cases where elements to be replaced are absent from the array.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use Python, leveraging its dynamic nature and the ability to handle large datasets efficiently. The system will maintain an array of integers, which can be dynamically modified based on the queries received. For efficient querying and replacement, we will use a list to store the array and perform operations directly on it.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: We need to handle two types of queries: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to ensure the array contains at least one instance of the element being replaced.\n    Explanation: When replacing elements, we must ensure that the element to be replaced exists in the array before attempting the replacement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb is not directly applicable in the context of the requirement, as it does not pertain to the core concepts of adding and replacing elements in an array.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not involve finding the largest element in the array, so the degree adverb 'largest' is not relevant.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we should consider the following steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: \n    1 2 1\n    Explanation: \n    After processing the queries, the array initially contains [1, 2, 1]. The second query replaces all occurrences of 2 with 2, but since 2 does not exist in the array, the array remains unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
