{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

In order to type each letter, you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key.

No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\".\n\nGauge how long it will take to type the word s. Clarify how the initial hand position affects the calculation if it is not aligned with the start of the word. Consider if constraints or optimizations might influence the total time required in different keyboard layouts.

The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n## Prompt 3:\n[requirement]\nYou are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged in a single row in a specific sequence. The keyboard is structured in a way such that each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. This word also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. In order to type each letter, you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key. Then you need to press it carefully. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the distance between the keys. The distance between two keys is defined as the absolute difference in their positions on the keyboard. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to calculate the minimal time required to type a word based on the given keyboard layout. We will create a function that takes the keyboard layout and the word as input and returns the minimal typing time. We will also handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard is represented as a string of 26 characters, each character representing a key. The goal is to determine the minimal time required to type a given word using this keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'consecutively': Indicates that letters in the word should be typed one after another without skipping any.\n    Explanation: For example, if the word is \"abc\", you need to type 'a', then 'b', then 'c', without typing 'a' again before typing 'b'.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Refers to the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the minimal time needed to type the word, considering the distances between the keys on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word for each test case.\n    2. Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Calculate the time required to type each letter in the word based on its position on the keyboard.\n    4. Sum the times for all letters to get the total typing time for the word.\n    5. Repeat the above steps for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [5, 5, 4, 4, 4]. The number 4 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value (4), but 5 appears two times, which is more than or equal to its value (5).
