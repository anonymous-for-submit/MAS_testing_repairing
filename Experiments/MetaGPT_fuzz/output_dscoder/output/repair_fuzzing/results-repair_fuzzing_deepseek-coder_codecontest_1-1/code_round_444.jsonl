The application will manage an array of integers, handling two types of queries: adding an element to the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element. We will use a list to store the array and ensure the application can handle large datasets efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': This involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manage a dynamic array and perform specific operations on it, such as adding elements and replacing certain values.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to consider cases where the array is empty or where a specific element does not exist in the array.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'more than' is used to ensure that the code handles cases where the array is initially empty or when a specific element is not present in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb is not directly applicable in the given requirement as it does not focus on finding the largest element in the array.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not focus on finding the largest element in the array, so the degree adverb 'largest' is not relevant.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the code, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", add the element x to the end of the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: The array is empty initially.\n    Edge case 1 = [3, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n    Explanation: Initially, the array is empty. After processing the queries, the resulting array is [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n    Edge case 2: The element x does not exist in the array.\n    Edge case 2 = [1, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: The element 2 does not exist in the initial array. After processing the queries, the resulting array is [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 3: The array is empty after some operations.\n    Edge case 3 = [1, 3, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: After performing the queries, the array becomes empty after the last operation. The resulting array is [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already handles the edge cases by initializing an empty list and checking for the existence of elements in the array.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 444, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
