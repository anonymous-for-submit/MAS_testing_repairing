{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The mean is calculated as the sum of all elements divided by n. The solution should be efficient and handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a solution to calculate the number of pairs of positions to delete.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Provide clear and accurate results for each test case.\n- Handle up to 2 * 10^5 elements efficiently.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in data structures and arithmetic operations. The key idea is to calculate the total sum of the array and then iterate through all possible pairs of positions to check if deleting these positions maintains the mean. We will optimize this by avoiding unnecessary calculations and leveraging Python's efficient list operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the sum of all elements in the array divided by the number of elements, which is the average value of the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times as'\n    This phrase indicates that the number of times an element appears in the array should be at least equal to the element's value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest'\n    This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the total sum of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j).\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new sum after deleting the elements at positions i and j.\n    4. Check if the new mean of the remaining elements is equal to the original mean.\n    5. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation:\n    The original mean is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. We can delete the elements at positions 1 and 3 (0-based index) to get [2, 4] with a mean of (2+4)/2 = 3, which is not equal to 2.5. However, if we delete the elements at positions 1 and 2, we get [1, 4] with a mean of (1+4)/2 = 2.5, which is equal to the original mean. Similarly, deleting the elements at positions 2 and 3 also gives a mean of 2.5. Thus, there are 2 such pairs.\n\n    search([5, 5, 5, 5]) = 6\n    Explanation:\n    The original mean is (5+5+5+5)/4 = 5. We can delete any two elements, and the remaining mean will still be 5.
