{"name": "1607_C. Minimum Extraction", "description": "Yelisey has an array a of n integers.\n\nIf a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisei can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: \n\n  1. First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array. If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them. \n  2. Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1.\n\nHelp him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the original length of the array a. The second line of the description lists n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array a.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of them containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is a single integer \u2014 the maximal possible minimum in a, which can be obtained by several applications of the described operation to it.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n1\n10\n2\n0 0\n3\n-1 2 0\n4\n2 10 1 7\n2\n2 3\n5\n3 2 -4 -2 0\n2\n-1 1\n1\n-2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n10\n0\n2\n5\n2\n2\n2\n-2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example test case, the original length of the array n = 1. Therefore minimum extraction cannot be applied to it. Thus, the array remains unchanged and the answer is a_1 = 10.\n\nIn the second set of input data, the array will always consist only of zeros.\n\nIn the third set, the array will be changing as follows: [\\color{blue}{-1}, 2, 0] \u2192 [3, \\color{blue}{1}] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{2}]. The minimum elements are highlighted with \\color{blue}{blue}. The maximal one is 2.\n\nIn the fourth set, the array will be modified as [2, 10, \\color{blue}{1}, 7] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{1}, 9, 6] \u2192 [8, \\color{blue}{5}] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{3}].

We will implement this logic in a Python function that processes each test case efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'minimum extraction': This involves finding the smallest number in the array, removing it, and then subtracting this smallest number from each of the remaining elements. The goal is to maximize the smallest number in the array after any number of these operations.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manipulate the array by reducing its size and adjusting the remaining elements, with the ultimate goal of maximizing the smallest value in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    For each test case, the plan involves:\n    1. Finding the smallest element in the array.\n    2. Subtracting this smallest element from each of the remaining elements.\n    3. Repeating the process until the array length is 1 or less.\n    4. Returning the smallest value in the final array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The smallest element is 1. After subtracting 1 from each element, the array becomes [0, 1, 2]. The smallest value is 0.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [5, 5, 5]\n    Explanation: All elements are the same. Any single extraction will result in an array of [0, 0], and the smallest value is 0.\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: [10, 20, 30]\n    Explanation: The smallest element is 10. After subtracting 10 from each element, the array becomes [0, 10, 20]. The smallest value is 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the logic provided in the plan is sufficient to solve the problem. The operations are deterministic and do not require additional handling for specific edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires finding the maximum possible minimum value in an array after applying the minimum extraction operation multiple times. The solution should be efficient and scalable to handle large inputs. The output should be accurate and clear for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the minimum extraction operation to reduce the array length and maximize the minimum value.\n- Ensure the solution can handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance to handle edge cases.\n- Test the solution with various inputs to ensure accuracy and scalability.\nTo solve the problem of maximizing the minimal element in an array after multiple minimum extraction operations, we can use a greedy approach. The key idea is to repeatedly find and remove the minimum element from the array, which will reduce the array size and potentially increase the minimum value. We will use Python's built-in functions and data structures to efficiently manage the array operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'minimum extraction': This operation involves finding the smallest element in the array, removing it, and then subtracting its value from the remaining elements.

This can be achieved by finding the smallest element in the array and then considering the potential maximum value it can reach after multiple operations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: The minimum value in the array is 1. After one operation, the array becomes [2, 3] with a minimum of 2. The maximum possible minimum after multiple operations is 2.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [10, 20, 30]\n    Explanation: The minimum value in the array is 10.
