We will also optimize the algorithm to handle large inputs by leveraging efficient data structures and avoiding redundant calculations. The key steps include reading the input, computing the GCDs for all pairs, and summing them up modulo 10^9 + 7.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)': This is a mathematical concept used to find the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. In the context of the requirement, it is used to find the common divisors of pairs of numbers in the array and their respective indices.\n    Explanation: The GCD function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is essential for computing the sum of products of GCDs of array elements and their indices.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find numbers greater than a certain value.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to consider pairs (i, j) where both i and j are within the range of the array length, and the GCD of the elements at these indices should be considered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest value that meets a certain condition.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find the largest GCD value that can be obtained for any pair (i, j) in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently calculate the prettiness value, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1.

Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 1, 1, 1]) = 10\n    Explanation: Since all elements are the same, the GCD of any pair (i, j) will be the element itself, and the GCD of indices will also be 1. The sum will be 4 * (GCD(1, 1) * GCD(1, 1)) = 4 * 1 * 1 = 4.

The sum will be 3 * (GCD(10^5, 10^5) * GCD(1, 1)) = 3 * 10^5 * 1 = 3 * 10^5.

However, since we are summing over all pairs, we need to consider the total number of pairs, which is n * (n - 1) / 2, giving us 10 pairs in this case.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic already accounts for the largest possible array size and ensures the result's accuracy.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'modulus operation': This is used to ensure that the result remains within the specified range by taking the remainder after division by a certain number.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to output the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's constraints.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'modulo': This phrase indicates that we need to find the remainder after division by a certain number.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to ensure that the sum of products does not exceed the modulus value to get the correct result.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'modulo 10^9 + 7': This degree adverb indicates the specific modulus value we need to use.\n    Explanation: The modulus operation is used to keep the result within the specified range, ensuring it fits within the constraints of the problem.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently calculate the prettiness value, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1. Read the input array and its length.\n    2. Compute the GCD of all pairs (a_i, a_j) and (i, j).\n    3. Sum up the products of these GCDs for all pairs.\n    4. Apply the modulus operation to the result.\n    5. Return the final result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([10^5, 10^5, 10^5]) = (10^5 * 10^5 * 10^5) % (10^9 + 7)\n    Explanation: Since all elements are the same and very large, the GCD of any pair (i, j) will be the element itself, and the GCD of indices will also be 1. The sum will be 3 * (GCD(10^5, 10^5) * GCD(1, 1)) = 3 * 10^5 * 1 = 3 * 10^5. Applying the modulus operation gives us the final result.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
