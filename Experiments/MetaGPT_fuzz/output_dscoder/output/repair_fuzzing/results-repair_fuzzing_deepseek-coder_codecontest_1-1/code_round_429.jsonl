{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves calculating the mean of the entire array, then checking each pair of positions to see if deleting the elements at these positions results in the same mean. The challenge lies in optimizing this process for large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through all pairs of positions and check if deleting the elements results in the same mean.\n- Optimize the function to handle large inputs efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is robust and handles edge cases, such as all elements being the same.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations. We will calculate the mean of the array once and then iterate through all pairs of positions to check if deleting the elements at these positions results in the same mean.

The solution must handle large inputs efficiently, adhering to the constraints provided.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through all pairs of positions and check if deleting them maintains the mean.\n- Optimize the solution to handle large inputs within the given constraints.\n- Add user input handling to allow for dynamic array input.\n- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of positions to check if deleting them maintains the mean. We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness and then optimize it if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of elements divided by the number of elements\n    'pairwise deletion': considering the removal of two specific elements from the array\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly two elements': indicates that we need to remove two specific elements from the array\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'equal to': means that the mean of the remaining elements should match the mean of the original array\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Calculate the mean of the entire array\n    - Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j\n    - For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at indices i and j\n    - Count the number of pairs that result in the new mean being equal to the original mean\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    expected output = 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, removing any two will change the mean, so the output is 0.\n\n    n = 4, array = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    expected output = 1\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+3+5+7)/4 = 4. Removing the elements at indices 1 and 2 (3 and 5) results in a mean of 4, so there is one valid pair.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has only three elements, as removing any two will change the mean.\n        if n == 3:\n            return 0\n\n    (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 429, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 317}
