{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness and then optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'arithmetic mean': The sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n    Explanation: The arithmetic mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that removing the elements at these indices results in the remaining elements having the same arithmetic mean as the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find pairs of indices where removing the elements results in the same arithmetic mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest possible pairs of indices that meet the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Removing any two elements will change the mean. For example, removing elements at indices 0 and 1 results in a mean of 3, while removing elements at indices 1 and 2 results in a mean of 1. No pair of indices will result in the original mean.\n    Expected output: 0\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: n = 4, array = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+3+5+7)/4 = 4.
