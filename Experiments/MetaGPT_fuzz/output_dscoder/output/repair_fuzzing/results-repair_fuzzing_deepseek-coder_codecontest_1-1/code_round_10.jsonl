{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Now he wants to finish the first stage of this game. A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp's character starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column. Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid. There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends. To complete the level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nInput:\n- The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n- Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n- The first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n- The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n- Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput:\n- For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n[plan]\n- We will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game mechanics.\n- The game will be designed using Python, leveraging the Pygame library for handling graphics and user interactions.\n- The game will be a 2D grid-based puzzle where the player navigates through the grid to reach the end without falling into traps.\n- The game will be designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'grid-based puzzle': The game is structured as a 2D grid with specific movement rules.\n    Explanation: The player must navigate through a grid where each cell can be either safe or contain a trap. The goal is to move from the start (cell (1, 1)) to the end (cell (2, n)) without dying.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship found in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb found in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the game logic, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the end is found. We will also need to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them, which could lead to infinite loops.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: n = 3, level = ['000', '000']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns and all cells safe, the character can move directly from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, level = ['0011', '1100']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The character can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (2, 3) to (2, 4), avoiding the traps in cells (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 2).\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, level = ['0111', '1110']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The character is trapped from the start, as moving right from (1, 1) leads to a trap, and moving down from (1, 1) does not change the situation. The character cannot reach the end without falling into a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    The core logic of the BFS algorithm already handles edge cases effectively. The BFS ensures that all possible paths are explored, and since the start and end cells are safe, the algorithm will naturally avoid traps unless there is no way to reach the end without falling into one. Therefore, no extra code is needed for handling edge cases beyond the core BFS implementation.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.
