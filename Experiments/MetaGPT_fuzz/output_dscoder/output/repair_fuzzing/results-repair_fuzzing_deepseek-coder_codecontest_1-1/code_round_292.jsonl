{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The count method on a string returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n\n# [core concept]\n    'positive': means that all integer in the list is > 0\n    'at least as many times': means appears of a number >= its value\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find integer > 0\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find the integer whose appears times is greater than or equal to its value\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need the biggest integer that appears greater or equal to its value\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need. \n\n# [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': The average value of the elements in an array, calculated as the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements.\n    Explanation: The mathematic mean (average) is a fundamental concept in statistics and is used to summarize the central tendency of a dataset. In this problem, we need to ensure that after removing two elements, the remaining elements still have the same average as the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find pairs of elements whose deletion does not change the average.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"more than\" is used to specify that we are looking for pairs of positions where the deletion does not affect the average of the remaining elements.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest possible number of such pairs.\n    Explanation: The degree adverb \"largest\" suggests that we should aim to maximize the number of pairs deleted while maintaining the original average.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, check if the deletion of elements at positions i and j maintains the original mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs and return the count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: If the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: An empty substring appears four times in the original string 'abc'. The count method on a string returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 292, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 239}
