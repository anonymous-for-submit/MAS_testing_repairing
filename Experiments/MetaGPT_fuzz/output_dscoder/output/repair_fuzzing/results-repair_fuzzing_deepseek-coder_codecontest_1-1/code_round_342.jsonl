The system needs to maintain a list of integers and perform these operations in real-time as queries are received.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array.\n- Implement the ability to replace elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final state of the array.\nTo efficiently handle the large number of queries, we will use a Python list to store the array elements. For each query of type '1', we will append the element to the list. For each query of type '2', we will replace all occurrences of the specified element with another element. We will ensure that the operations are performed in real-time as queries are received.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves managing a list of integers and performing operations to add new elements and replace existing ones based on given queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of elements in the array will increase.\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the array will grow in size as new elements are added.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Not applicable in this context as there are no degree adverbs directly related to size or magnitude.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the large number of queries, we will use a Python list to store the array elements. For each query of type '1', we will append the element to the list. For each query of type '2', we will replace all occurrences of the specified element with another element. We will ensure that the operations are performed in real-time as queries are received.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1], 2) = [1]\n    Explanation: Since the array is empty initially, the query \"1 1\" adds the element 1, and the query \"2 1 2\" does nothing as there is no occurrence of 1 to replace.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1, 2, 3], 2, 4) = [1, 4, 3]\n    Explanation: The query \"2 2 4\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in the array [1, 4, 3].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 5) = [1, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n    Explanation: The query \"2 2 5\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 5, resulting in the array [1, 5, 5, 3, 3].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic is sufficient to handle the edge cases by ensuring that the array is updated correctly based on the queries.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 342, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
