In the context of the requirement, it means we need to calculate the GCD for pairs of elements and their indices.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'more than' is used to specify that we need to consider all pairs (i, j) where i \u2260 j, ensuring that we evaluate the GCD for every possible pair in the array and their indices.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the maximum or greatest value among a set of values.

The GCD of 1 and 2 is 1, and the GCD of 1 and 2 is also 1. Therefore, the prettiness value is 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 3, a = [2, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 11\n    Explanation: The pairs and their GCDs are:\n        - (1, 2): GCD(2, 2) = 2, GCD(1, 2) = 1, result = 2 * 1 = 2\n        - (1, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(1, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n        - (2, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(2, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n    Summing these results gives 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Therefore, the result is the sum of the products of each element with itself (10 * 1) for all pairs, which is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        To handle large arrays efficiently, we can use a nested loop approach with optimizations to avoid redundant calculations.

In the context of the requirement, it is used to find the common divisors of pairs of numbers in the array and their respective indices.\n    Explanation: The GCD function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is crucial for determining the prettiness value of the array by summing the products of GCDs of pairs of elements and their indices.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to consider pairs where one number is greater than the other. In the context of the requirement, it means we need to calculate the GCD for pairs of elements and their indices.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'more than' is used to specify that we need to consider all pairs (i, j) where i \u2260 j, ensuring that we evaluate the GCD for every possible pair in the array and their indices.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the maximum or greatest value among a set of values. In the context of the requirement, it means we need to find the largest GCD value for any pair of elements and their indices.\n    Explanation: The 'largest' adverb is used to specify that we need to find the maximum GCD value among all pairs (i, j) to determine the prettiness value of the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently compute the prettiness value of the array, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries such as math for GCD computation and itertools for efficient iteration. The algorithm will involve nested loops to calculate the sum of gcd(a_i, a_j) * gcd(i, j) for all pairs (i, j). We will optimize the GCD computation using the Euclidean algorithm and ensure the solution is optimized for handling large arrays by using efficient data structures and avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 2, a = [1, 2]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: With only two elements in the array, there is only one pair (1, 2). The GCD of 1 and 2 is 1, and the GCD of 1 and 2 is also 1. Therefore, the prettiness value is 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 3, a = [2, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 11\n    Explanation: The pairs and their GCDs are:\n        - (1, 2): GCD(2, 2) = 2, GCD(1, 2) = 1, result = 2 * 1 = 2\n        - (1, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(1, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n        - (2, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(2, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n    Summing these results gives 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. However, this is incorrect based on the given formula. The correct calculation should be:\n        - (1, 2): GCD(2, 2) = 2, GCD(1, 2) = 1, result = 2 * 1 = 2\n        - (1, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(1, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n        - (2, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, GCD(2, 3) = 1, result = 1 * 1 = 1\n    Summing these results gives 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. This edge case highlights the need for careful implementation of the GCD calculation and the correct application of the formula.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 10, a = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n    Expected output: 100\n    Explanation: Since all elements in the array are the same, the GCD of any element with any other element is the same as the GCD of any element with itself, which is the element itself. The GCD of any index with any other index is 1. Therefore, the result is the sum of the products of each element with itself (10 * 1) for all pairs, which is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        To handle large arrays efficiently, we can use a nested loop approach with optimizations to avoid redundant calculations. Additionally, we can use memoization to store previously computed GCD values to save time on repeated calculations.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves computing the sum of the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of pairs of elements in the array and their respective indices.
