Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    search([1]) = [1]\n    Explanation: The array is initially empty and after adding the element 1, it remains as [1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: Replacing all occurrences of 2 with 3 results in the array [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: Replacing all occurrences of 2 with 3 results in the array [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers the basic and unusual input scenarios.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating an application that can handle a large number of queries efficiently. The application needs to be able to add integers to a list and replace specific integers with another integer. The output should reflect the final state of the list after all operations.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should handle the addition of integers to the list\n- The main code should handle the replacement of integers in the list\n- The main code should output the final state of the list after all operations\n- Ensure the application is efficient in handling a large number of queries\n- Provide clear and concise user feedback\nTo implement this application efficiently, we will use Python, leveraging its dynamic array capabilities and built-in list methods. The application will handle two types of queries: adding an element to the list and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element. We will ensure that the application is scalable and can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept here is the manipulation of an array (list in Python) based on given queries.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves adding elements to an initially empty list and replacing specific elements with others. This requires understanding how to efficiently manage and modify lists in Python.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to ensure the list is large enough to accommodate new elements and that we are considering the size of the list when performing operations.\n    Explanation: When adding elements, we need to ensure the list has enough capacity to hold new elements. When replacing elements, we need to ensure we are not exceeding the bounds of the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the largest index in the list to ensure we are not accessing out-of-bounds elements.\n    Explanation: When replacing elements, we need to ensure we are not accessing elements beyond the current size of the list.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the logic, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the list.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the list.\n    5. Return the final list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Large number of queries\n    Edge case 2: Replacing an element with a value that does not exist in the list\n    Edge case 3: Adding a large number of elements in quick succession\n\n    Edge case 1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the scalability of the solution when dealing with a large number of queries. The solution should handle this efficiently without performance degradation.\n\n    Edge case 2 = [1, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the ability of the solution to handle cases where the element to be replaced does not exist in the list. The solution should not modify the list in this case.\n\n    Edge case 3 = [1, 3, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the efficiency of the solution when adding a large number of elements in quick succession. The solution should handle this efficiently without performance degradation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
