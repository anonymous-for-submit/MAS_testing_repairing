The program will handle the array operations by maintaining a list to store the integers and processing each query accordingly. We will ensure that the program can handle large datasets efficiently by using efficient data structures and optimizing the operations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': This involves adding elements to the end of an array, and replacing elements within the array.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manage a dynamic list of integers, where operations like appending and replacing elements are common.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates a condition where a specific value must be exceeded.\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, it means that if a query involves replacing elements, the value of 'x' must be present in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that the final result should be the biggest value in the array.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, it implies that if a query involves replacing elements, the new value 'y' should be greater than the current value 'x' to be considered the largest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests processing each query one by one, which means the steps are not necessarily considered simultaneously.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: The array is initially empty, and the first query is to add an element.\n    Edge case 1 = [5]\n    Explanation: Since the array is empty, adding the element 5 results in the array having a single element, [5].\n\n    Edge case 2: The array contains elements, and the first query is to add an element that is not present in the array.\n    Edge case 2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: Assuming the array initially has elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], adding the element 6 results in the array being [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n\n    Edge case 3: The array contains elements, and the first query is to replace an element that is not present in the array.\n    Edge case 3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: If the array initially has elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the first query is to replace element 6 with 7, the array remains unchanged as 6 is not present.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to manage the array operations without needing additional checks for edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve creating an array and performing two types of operations on it: appending elements and substituting elements. The first operation is straightforward, but the second operation requires handling edge cases such as when the array is empty or when the element to be substituted is not present. The system must also handle a large number of queries efficiently, which necessitates optimization.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to append elements to the array.\n- Implement the ability to substitute elements in the array.\n- Ensure the system handles edge cases, such as an empty array or a non-existent element to be substituted.\n- Optimize the system for handling a large number of queries efficiently.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use Python, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency. The system will maintain an array that can be dynamically modified by appending elements and substituting specific elements. We will ensure that the system handles edge cases effectively, such as when the array is empty or when a substitution is attempted with a non-existent element. Performance will be optimized to handle a large number of queries efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves understanding how to dynamically modify an array by appending elements and substituting specific elements.\n    Explanation: An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. The operations include adding elements to the end (append) and replacing specific elements with another value (substitute).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that a condition must be met where a value appears a certain number of times.\n    Explanation: For example, \"more than\" can be used to find elements that appear at least a specific number of times in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb describes the need to find the largest element in the array after manipulations.\n    Explanation: For instance, finding the largest element after substitutions gives insight into the maximum value reached in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the logic, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace every instance of x with y in the array.\n    5. After processing all queries, return the resulting array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Array is empty initially.\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, so the first three queries add elements 1 and 2. The last query replaces all 2s with 2s, resulting in [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2: Substitution with a value not present in the array.\n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 3 4\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array initially has elements 1 and 2. The substitution query attempts to replace 3 with 4, but 3 is not in the array, so the array remains unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 3: Large number of queries.\n    Input: \n    7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: 3 2 2 3 2\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After adding elements 3 and 1, it is transformed to [3, 1]. Substituting 1 with 2 results in [3, 2]. Adding more 2s and 1s, and finally replacing all 1s with 3s results in [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    To handle the edge case where the array is empty initially, we should check if the array is empty before performing substitutions.\n    For the edge case where a substitution is attempted with a value not present in the array, we should add a check to ensure the value to be substituted exists in the array before performing the substitution.\n    For the edge case with a large number of queries, we should ensure the code is optimized to handle a large number of queries efficiently without performance degradation.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 446, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
