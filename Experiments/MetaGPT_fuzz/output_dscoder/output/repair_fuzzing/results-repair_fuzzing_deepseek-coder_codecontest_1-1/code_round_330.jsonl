The '2 x y' query type requires the application to search through the array and replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y', which could be resource-intensive if not implemented correctly. The '1 x' query type simply appends 'x' to the array, which is straightforward but needs to be done efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient array manipulation for both query types.\n- Ensure the application can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final array state.\n- Include user-friendly input handling for both query types.\n- Implement basic error handling for invalid inputs.\nTo efficiently handle the given queries, we will use a Python list to represent the array, which allows for efficient append and replace operations. For each query of type '1', we will append the element to the list. For each query of type '2', we will replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list. We will ensure that the operations are performed efficiently by leveraging Python's built-in list methods.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing a list of integers and performing operations to append elements and replace specific values within the list.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty list, where each operation can either add an element to the end of the list or replace all occurrences of a specified value with another value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to ensure the operation is performed for all elements greater than zero.\n    Explanation: The phrase 'more than' is used to specify that the integer must be greater than zero for it to be considered in the search for the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the biggest integer that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as itself.\n    Explanation: The 'largest' degree adverb is used to specify that we need to find the biggest integer in the list that satisfies the condition of appearing at least as many times as its value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle these operations, we can use a Python list to represent the array.

The program must be efficient enough to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries, which implies that the operations must be performed in a time-efficient manner. The output should be a list of integers after all queries have been executed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to append an element to the array.\n- Implement a function to replace all occurrences of an element with another in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final array after all queries.\nTo efficiently handle the operations on an array of integers, we will use Python's built-in list data structure for appending elements and for performing the replacement operations.
