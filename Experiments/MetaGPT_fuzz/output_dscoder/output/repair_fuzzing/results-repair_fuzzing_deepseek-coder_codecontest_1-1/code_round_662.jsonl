{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The pairs [0, 3] and [1, 2] can be deleted to keep the mean equal to 2.5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the edge case where all elements are the same.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires calculating the number of pairs of positions to delete from an array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains unchanged. This involves iterating through the array, calculating the mean, and then checking pairs of elements to see if their deletion maintains the original mean.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Iterate through the array to find pairs of positions to delete.\n- Check if the deletion of a pair maintains the original mean.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs.\n- Ensure the solution is clear and easy to understand.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in data structures and libraries. The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find pairs of positions that, when deleted, maintain the original mean. We will iterate through the array and use a set to keep track of the sums of elements that would maintain the original mean after deletion. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the required pairs without recalculating the mean for every possible pair.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': the average of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find pairs of positions in an array such that the mean of the remaining elements is equal to the mean of the entire array. This involves calculating the mean of the array and then checking pairs of elements to see if their deletion maintains the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of elements whose deletion does not significantly alter the mean.\n    'at least as many times': implies that we need to ensure the remaining elements still meet the mean condition after deletion.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': suggests that we need to find the largest possible pairs that maintain the mean.\n    'smallest': implies that we need to consider the smallest possible pairs that still maintain the mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new sum of the array after removing the elements at positions i and j.\n    4. Check if the new mean of the remaining elements is equal to the original mean.\n    5. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 0\n    explanation: In this case, no matter which two elements are removed, the mean of the remaining elements will not be equal to the original mean. Therefore, the expected output is 0.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 2\n    explanation: The original mean is (2+2+4+4)/4 = 3. Removing the first two elements or the last two elements will both result in a mean of 3. Thus, there are two pairs that maintain the original mean.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array contains elements that are all the same. In such cases, any pair of elements can be removed without changing the mean.\n    Example:\n    if all elements are the same:\n        return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\nPlease note that the edge cases provided in the example are hypothetical and may not directly apply to the given problem statement.
