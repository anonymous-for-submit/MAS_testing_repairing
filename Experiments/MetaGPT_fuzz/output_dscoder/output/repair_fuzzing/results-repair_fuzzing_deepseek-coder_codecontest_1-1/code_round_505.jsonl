{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The output should be the count of such pairs for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Identify pairs of positions [i, j] where deleting the elements results in the mean remaining unchanged.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the algorithm to handle large inputs within performance constraints.\n- Ensure the solution is robust and can handle edge cases.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling mathematical operations. The main challenge is to identify pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions maintains the original mean of the array. We will use a brute-force approach initially to ensure correctness, and then optimize it for handling large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean'\n    In the requirement, it refers to the average of the elements in the array, calculated as the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the entire array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at these indices.\n    4. Check if the new mean equals the original mean.\n    5. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation:\n    The original mean is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. The pairs [i, j] that can be removed to maintain the mean are [0, 1] and [0, 2], resulting in the new array [3, 4] with a mean of (3+4)/2 = 3.5, which is equal to the original mean.\n    search([1, 1, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation:\n    The original mean is (1+1+1)/3 = 1. The only pair [i, j] is [0, 1], resulting in the new array [1], with a mean of 1, which is equal to the original mean.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The brute-force approach will work for small arrays, and we can optimize it later if necessary.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 505, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 11}
