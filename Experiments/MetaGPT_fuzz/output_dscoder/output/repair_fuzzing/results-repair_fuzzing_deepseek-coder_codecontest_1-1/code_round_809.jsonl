{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The function will first map each key to its position, then iterate through the word to calculate the time based on the positions of consecutive letters. We will use a simple and efficient approach to handle the input and output, ensuring scalability and user-friendliness.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key represents a distinct character.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard is represented as a string of 26 characters, each character corresponding to a key. The position of each key is determined by its order in the alphabet, and this order is used to calculate the time to type a word.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of times a character appears in the word should be greater than or equal to the character's value.\n    Explanation: For example, if a character appears 3 times in the word, it should be considered more than or equal to 3.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the character with the highest frequency that meets the condition should be selected.\n    Explanation: For example, if there are multiple characters that appear the same number of times, the largest character should be chosen.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Map each key to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the time to type the word by summing the absolute differences between the positions of consecutive letters.\n    3. Handle edge cases where the word contains repeated or adjacent characters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears 3 times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: No integer appears more than or equal to its value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic is sufficient to determine the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not lst:\n            return -1\n        freq_dict = {}\n        for num in lst:\n            if num in freq_dict:\n                freq_dict[num] += 1\n            else:\n                freq_dict[num] = 1\n        max_num = -1\n        for num, freq in freq_dict.items():\n            if freq >= num and num > max_num:\n                max_num = num\n        return max_num if max_num != -1 else -1\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the word to be typed is also given, with a length ranging from 1 to 50 characters. The challenge lies in determining the time taken to move the hand between keys, considering the positions of the keys in the row.
