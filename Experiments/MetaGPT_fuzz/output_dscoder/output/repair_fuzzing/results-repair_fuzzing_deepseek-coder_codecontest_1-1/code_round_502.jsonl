You have to perform q queries. Each query is of one of two types: \"1 x\" \u2014 add the element x to the end of the array; \"2 x y\" \u2014 replace all occurrences of x in the array with y. Find the resulting array after performing all the queries. Ensure your solution efficiently handles multiple queries to optimize performance.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).

Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\n[plan]\nTo efficiently handle the queries, we will use a list to store the array of integers. For each query of type '1 x', we will append the integer 'x' to the list. For each query of type '2 x y', we will iterate through the list and replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y'. We will ensure that the solution is optimized for performance by using Python's built-in list operations, which are generally efficient for such operations.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to manage an array of integers and perform two types of operations: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': Refers to the condition where an element must appear a minimum number of times to be replaced.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the operation should consider the largest possible value or the maximum number of occurrences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a list to store the array of integers.
