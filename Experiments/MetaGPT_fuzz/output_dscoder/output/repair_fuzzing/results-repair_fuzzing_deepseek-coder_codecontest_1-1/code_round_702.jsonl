{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keyboard layout is provided as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the word to be typed is also provided as a string of lowercase Latin letters. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the time based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard. Precomputing the positions of the keys can significantly optimize the solution.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the typing time for a given word on a custom keyboard layout.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting the keyboard layout and the word to be typed.\n- Implement a clear and concise output format for the calculated typing time.\n- Allow for easy modification and testing of different keyboard layouts and words.\nTo solve this problem, we will precompute the positions of each key on the keyboard. This will allow us to quickly determine the time required to type any given word. We will use a Python function that takes the keyboard layout and the word as input and returns the total typing time. The function will iterate through each character in the word, find its position on the keyboard, and sum the absolute differences between consecutive positions.

The function will first precompute the positions of each letter on the keyboard to optimize the calculation for subsequent words. This will involve mapping each letter to its position in the keyboard and storing this mapping for quick lookup.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to type a word on a specific keyboard layout. The keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 lowercase Latin letters, representing the order of the keys from 'a' to 'z'.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency of a letter's appearance in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, if a letter appears twice in the word, it means that the letter's position needs to be considered twice in the calculation of typing time.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': Indicates the smallest possible time required to type the word.\n    Explanation: We need to find the minimal time to type the word, considering the positions of the keys on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The logic involves precomputing the positions of each letter on the keyboard and then calculating the typing time for each word based on these positions.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], 'abc') = 2\n    Explanation: The positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The typing time is |2-1| + |3-2| + |3-3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n    search(['z', 'y', 'x', 'w', 'v', 'u', 't', 's', 'r', 'q', 'p', 'o', 'n', 'm', 'l', 'k', 'j', 'i', 'h', 'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'], 'abc') = 58\n    Explanation: The positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 26, 25, and 24 respectively. The typing time is |26-25| + |25-24| + |24-24| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Since the keyboard is reversed, the total time is 2 * 26 - 2 = 58.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to calculate the typing time for any given word on any keyboard layout.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the keyboard is reversed or where the word contains letters not present on the keyboard.\n        if not all(letter in keyboard for letter in word):\n            return \"Error: Word contains letters not on the keyboard\"\n        if keyboard != 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n            return \"Error: Keyboard layout is not in alphabetical order\"\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 702, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
