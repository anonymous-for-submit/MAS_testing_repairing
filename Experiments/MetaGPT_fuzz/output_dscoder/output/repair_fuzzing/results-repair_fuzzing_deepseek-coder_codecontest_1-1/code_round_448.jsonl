Initialize an empty list to represent the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query, performing the appropriate action based on the query type.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. After processing all queries, return the resulting array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': adding elements and replacing occurrences\n\n    Explanation: The core concept here is managing an array of integers, specifically adding elements to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another element. This involves both insertion and update operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase is not directly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred from the context of replacing all occurrences of an element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This phrase is not directly mentioned in the requirement, but it can be inferred from the context of finding the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan provided outlines a logical approach to handling the queries:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to represent the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query, performing the appropriate action based on the query type.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. After processing all queries, return the resulting array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
