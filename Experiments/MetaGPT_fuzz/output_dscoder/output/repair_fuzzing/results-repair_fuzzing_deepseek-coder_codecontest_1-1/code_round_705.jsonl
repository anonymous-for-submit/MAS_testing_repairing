The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries and must correctly handle edge cases, such as when an element to be replaced is not present in the array.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for handling a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Implement error handling to manage cases where an element to be replaced is not present in the array.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the application.\nTo handle the requirements efficiently, we will use a Python list to represent the array of integers. For the second type of query, we will use the `list.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element. We will ensure the solution is optimized for handling a large number of queries efficiently by using list operations that have O(1) time complexity for appending elements and O(n) time complexity for replacing elements.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: We need to handle two types of queries: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to replace all instances of a specified element with another element.\n    Explanation: In the query \"2 x y\", 'x' is the element to be replaced, and 'y' is the element to replace 'x'.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb is not applicable in the given context as it does not describe a characteristic of the array manipulation.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not involve finding the largest element in the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we should:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append 'x' to the list.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", use the `list.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list.\n    5.

Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query_count = 1, x = 1 = expected output: [1]\n    Explanation: If there is only one query of the first type (adding an element), the array should contain only that element.\n\n    query_count = 4, queries = [\"1 1\", \"1 2\", \"1 1\", \"2 2 2\"] = expected output: [1, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, then we add 1, then 2, then 1 again, and finally, we replace all 2s with 2s, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    query_count = 8, queries = [\"2 1 4\", \"1 1\", \"1 4\", \"1 2\", \"2 2 4\", \"2 4 3\", \"1 2\", \"2 2 7\"] = expected output: [1, 3, 3, 7]\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, then we replace 1 with 4, add 1, 4, and 2, replace 2 with 4, then 4 with 3, add 2, and finally replace 2 with 7, resulting in the array [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

The queries can either add an element to the end of the array or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element. The program must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries and should be able to manage edge cases where the array remains unchanged due to the absence of the specified element. The output should be a list of integers representing the state of the array after all queries have been executed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to handle the addition of elements to the array.\n- Implement a function to handle the replacement of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Implement robust error handling to manage edge cases.\n- Ensure the output matches the specified format.\nWe will use Python, leveraging its dynamic array capabilities and efficient list manipulation methods. The function will handle two types of queries: adding an element to the array and replacing all occurrences of a specified element with another element. To ensure efficiency, we will use Python's built-in list for dynamic array operations and optimize the replacement operation by using a simple loop for direct replacement.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': handling dynamic arrays and performing operations efficiently.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves adding elements to an initially empty array and replacing specific elements with others. The efficiency is crucial, especially with a large number of queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates the presence of an element in the array.\n    'at least as many times': refers to the frequency of an element in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the array manipulation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    - Iterate through each query.\n    - For query type \"1 x\": Append the element x to the array.\n    - For query type \"2 x y\": Replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    - Return the final array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array initially has [1, 2, 1].
