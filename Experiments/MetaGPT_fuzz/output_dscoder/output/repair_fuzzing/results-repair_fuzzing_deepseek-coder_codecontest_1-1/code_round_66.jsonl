We will iterate through all pairs of elements and their indices, compute the GCD for each pair, and sum up the products of these GCDs. To handle large inputs, we will use efficient algorithms and ensure the solution is modular to facilitate future adaptations.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)': This is a mathematical concept used to find the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. In the context of the requirement, it is used to find the common divisors of pairs of elements in the array and their indices.\n    Explanation: The GCD function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is essential for computing the aggregate sum of the product of GCDs for all pairs (i, j) in the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To efficiently calculate the prettiness value of the array, we will use Python's built-in math library for GCD calculations and optimize the use of data structures. We will iterate through all pairs of elements and their indices, compute the GCD for each pair, and sum up the products of these GCDs. To handle large inputs, we will use efficient algorithms and ensure the solution is modular to facilitate future adaptations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 2, a = [1, 2]\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: The GCD of (1, 1) is 1, the GCD of (1, 2) is 1, the GCD of (2, 1) is 1, and the GCD of (2, 2) is 2. The sum of products is 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*2 = 4. Since n is small, this edge case is straightforward.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 3, a = [4, 6, 8]\n    Expected output: 100\n    Explanation: The GCD of (4, 4) is 4, the GCD of (4, 6) is 2, the GCD of (4, 8) is 4, the GCD of (6, 4) is 2, the GCD of (6, 6) is 6, the GCD of (6, 8) is 2, the GCD of (8, 4) is 4, the GCD of (8, 6) is 2, and the GCD of (8, 8) is 8. The sum of products is 4*4 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 2*6 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 4*8 + 2*2 + 8*8 = 16 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 4 + 64 = 148. This edge case checks the function's ability to handle larger numbers and more complex GCD calculations.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 1, a = [7]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, there are no pairs to consider, so the sum of products is 0.
