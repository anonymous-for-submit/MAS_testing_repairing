We can remove elements from the sequence to achieve this goal.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find indices where the value at the index is greater than the index itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the sequence [4, 2, 3, 1], the value at index 2 is 3, which is more than 2.

Removing more elements might not increase f(a) further.\n    search([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 0\n    Explanation: The initial sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
