{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each letter in the word must be typed sequentially, and the time for positioning the hand over the initial letter is not included. The time for each subsequent letter is determined by the absolute difference in positions between the current and the previous letter.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': means the number of times a letter appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" it means that if a number appears more than or equal to its value, it meets the condition.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'more than': means greater than.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than zero,\" it means that the integer must be greater than 0.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the absolute difference in positions for each pair of consecutive letters in the word.\n    3. Sum these differences to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that appear more than or equal to their value. The integer 3 appears three times, which is more than or equal to its value, and it is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, no integer appears more than or equal to its value. The integer 2 appears once, the integer 3 appears twice, and the integer 4 appears three times, but none of them appear more than or equal to their value. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need to calculate the time required to type a given word based on the positions of the letters on a keyboard.
