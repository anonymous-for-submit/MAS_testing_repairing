We need to find the maximum number of elements where the value at a particular index i is equal to i.\n    Explanation: In the given sequence, we need to find the positions where the value of the element is equal to its index. For example, in the sequence [2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7], the value at index 1 is 2, which is not equal to 1, but the value at index 2 is 1, which is equal to 2.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the sequence and check for each element if it satisfies the condition a_i = i. We can then remove elements and check the updated sequence for the maximum count of such indices. This can be efficiently done using a loop and conditional checks.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: In this sequence, every element's index matches its value. Therefore, no elements need to be removed, and the largest possible f(a) is 5.\n    Edge Case 2:\n    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: In this sequence, no element's index matches its value. The largest possible f(a) is 0 since no elements can be removed to satisfy the condition.\n    Edge Case 3:\n    Input: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n    Explanation: In this sequence, the values at indices 1 and 4 are equal to their respective indices. The largest possible f(a) is 2 since we can remove elements to get sequences like [3, 2] or [1, 5, 4] where f(a) is 0, or [2, 5, 4] where f(a) is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the logic to find the maximum f(a) can be implemented within the main loop without additional conditional checks for edge cases.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires finding the maximum value of f(a), where f(a) is the number of indices where a_i = i.

The greedy approach helps us make the best choice at each step by focusing on the current best option.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find indices where the value at the index is greater than the index itself.\n    Explanation: For example, in the sequence `[2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7]`, the value at index 3 is 2, which is not equal to 3. We need to remove such elements to maximize f(a).\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest possible f(a) by removing elements.\n    Explanation: We need to remove elements to maximize the number of indices where `a_i = i`.
