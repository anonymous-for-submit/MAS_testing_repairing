{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then finding pairs that, when deleted, maintain the original mean. The challenge lies in handling large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of positions to delete.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Provide clear and accurate output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of positions to check if their deletion maintains the mean. We will use a brute-force method initially to ensure correctness and then optimize if necessary.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find the mean of the array and then determine how many pairs of elements can be removed such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find pairs of elements whose deletion does not change the mean significantly.\n    Explanation: For example, if we have a list of numbers and we want to find pairs [i, j] such that removing them does not change the mean, we need to ensure that the sum of the remaining elements divided by the count of the remaining elements equals the original mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest possible pairs that can be removed while maintaining the mean.\n    Explanation: In this context, 'largest' refers to the pairs that, when removed, have the least impact on the mean of the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at positions i and j.\n    4.

The main challenge is to ensure the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find the mean of the array and then determine how many pairs of elements can be removed such that the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that a certain condition must be met by a certain quantity.\n    Explanation: In this context, 'more than' is used to specify that the number of times an element appears in the array must be greater than or equal to the element's value for it to be considered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the maximum value or the highest degree to which a condition applies.\n    Explanation: In this problem, 'largest' is used to describe the element that appears the most times in the array, as we need to find the element that, when removed, does not change the mean of the array.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, check if removing the elements at these indices results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n    5. Return the count of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, it's impossible to remove any two elements and still have the mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, array = [1, 3, 2, 4]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+3+2+4)/4 = 2.5. The only pair that can be removed to keep the mean unchanged is [1, 3] or [1, 2], or [3, 2], or [1, 4], or [3, 4], or [2, 4]. There are 6 possible pairs, but since we are looking for pairs where i < j, there is only one valid pair.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has less than three elements.\n        if n < 3:\n            return 0\n\n    This code ensures that we do not attempt to find pairs of indices to remove if the array does not have at least three elements.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 670, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 11}
