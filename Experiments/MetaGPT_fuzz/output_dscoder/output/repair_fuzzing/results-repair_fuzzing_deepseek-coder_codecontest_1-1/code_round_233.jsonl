{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Monocarp directs a character, which starts at the cell (1, 1) \u2014 located at the intersection of the first row and first column.\n\nMonocarp's character is able to transfer from one cell to another in a single step if the cells are neighboring by side and/or corner; it is prohibited to go outside the grid, as doing so would mean Monocarp's character is outside the boundary. Keeping the character within the grid ensures no accidental game loss due to boundary violations.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level. You need to ensure Monocarp's path avoids all trap cells effectively. Consider edge cases where traps block essential paths or where few moves are required.

Since the grid is entirely safe, a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, 4).\n    search([4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]) = NO\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x4 matrix with a trap at (1, 3) and (2, 3). There is no safe path from (1, 1) to (2, 4) without stepping on a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the BFS algorithm inherently checks all possible paths and ensures that we do not step on traps. The constraints ensure that (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe, and the BFS will naturally avoid traps.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game is a 2-row, n-column grid with specific safe and trap cells. The character must move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without stepping on trap cells. The solution needs to determine if there's a safe path for the character to complete the level based on the given test cases.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code must read the input correctly and process each test case.\n- The code must check if there's a safe path from (1, 1) to (2, n) for each test case.\n- The output must be 'YES' if a safe path exists, otherwise 'NO'.\n- The code must handle up to 100 test cases efficiently.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without stepping on trap cells. The BFS will be implemented using a queue to explore all possible paths level by level. Each cell in the grid will be represented as a node in the graph, and edges will exist between adjacent cells in the same row or column.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid to find a path from the start to the end without stepping on trap cells.\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2xN matrix where each cell can either be safe ('0') or a trap ('1'). The goal is to find a path from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, N) without crossing any trap cells.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the BFS algorithm for grid traversal:\n    1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n    2. Start from the initial position (1, 1) and mark it as visited.\n    3. Use the queue to explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n    4. If a trap is encountered, skip that move.\n    5. If the bottom-right corner (2, N) is reached, return YES.\n    6. If the queue is exhausted without reaching (2, N), return NO.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case:\n    4\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    4\n    0011\n    1100\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    6\n    010101\n    101010\n\n    Expected output:\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n\n    Explanation:\n    - For n=3, the grid is fully traversable as there are no trap cells.\n    - For n=4, there is a trap cell in the second column, but the path can be found by avoiding the trap.\n    - For n=4, the grid is blocked by traps, so no path exists.\n    - For n=6, the grid is traversable as there are no trap cells blocking the path.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the BFS algorithm inherently checks all possible paths and avoids traps. The provided logic is sufficient to determine the presence of a safe path.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and ensuring the solution is efficient and user-friendly. The game involves a grid with traps that the player must navigate without falling into. The solution should be able to handle multiple test cases efficiently and provide clear output based on the grid configuration.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should efficiently process the input and determine if the level can be completed.\n- The game algorithm should ensure the character avoids traps and reaches the goal safely.\n- The UI should be responsive and provide clear feedback to the user.\n- The product should be accessible and work well on mobile devices.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The main challenge is to navigate through the grid avoiding traps and reaching the goal cell. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and find the shortest path from the start cell (1, 1) to the goal cell (2, n).\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid navigation': The core concept involves moving through a 2xN grid while avoiding traps, specifically focusing on the start (1, 1) and end (2, n) positions.\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2-row by N-column matrix where the character starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The character can move to adjacent cells by side or corner, and '0' represents a safe cell while '1' represents a trap.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm starting from (1, 1) and exploring all possible moves to reach (2, n). We will keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them and ensure the path remains within the grid boundaries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1: n = 3, grid = ['000', '010']\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: With only 3 columns, it's impossible to reach the goal cell (2, n) without crossing a trap. The grid setup does not allow for a path around the trap.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 4, grid = ['0000', '0000']\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: With 4 columns and a completely safe grid, the character can move from (1, 1) to (2, 4) without encountering any traps.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 5, grid = ['01010', '00000']\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid has traps but strategically placed to allow a path from (1, 1) to (2, 5) without activating any traps.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the BFS algorithm inherently checks all possible paths and ensures the character stays within the grid.
