{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The main challenge is to calculate the mean of the array and then find pairs of elements whose deletion does not change the mean.

The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently, even with large inputs. The output should be accurate and match the expected result for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of positions [i, j] to delete.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Provide clear and accurate output for each test case.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python's built-in functions and libraries to handle the array operations and pair counting. We will calculate the mean of the array for each test case and then find pairs of elements that, when removed, do not change the mean. This approach leverages Python's ability to handle large datasets efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean'\n    The mathematical mean, or average, of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. In this context, it refers to the average value of the elements in the array before and after any two elements are removed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of times an element appears in the array must be greater than or equal to the element's value for it to be considered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Refers to finding the largest element in the array that meets the condition of appearing at least as many times as its value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    For each test case:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of elements in the array.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean of the remaining elements.\n    4. Count the number of pairs that result in the new mean being equal to the original mean.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 0\n    Explanation: In this case, no matter which two elements are removed, the mean of the remaining elements will change because the array does not contain any duplicate values.\n    search([2, 2, 4, 4]) = 2\n    Explanation: There are two pairs (2, 4) and (4, 2) that can be removed to keep the mean unchanged.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where all elements are the same. In such cases, any pair of elements can be removed without changing the mean.\n        if all elements are the same:\n            return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\nPlease provide the coding plan and requirement for the next prompt.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 302, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "parent_index": 248}
