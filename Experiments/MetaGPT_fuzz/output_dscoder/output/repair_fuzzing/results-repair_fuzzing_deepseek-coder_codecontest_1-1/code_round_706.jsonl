We will iterate through each query and perform the corresponding action:\n    1. For query \"1 x\", append 'x' to the list.\n    2. For query \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list using list comprehension.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Performing a replacement on an empty array\n    search([], 1, 3) = []\n    Explanation: If the array is initially empty and we try to perform a replacement, the result should still be an empty array.\n\n    Edge case 2: Replacing an element that does not exist in the array\n    search([1, 2, 3], 4, 5) = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: If we try to replace an element that is not present in the array, the array should remain unchanged.\n\n    Edge case 3: Large number of queries\n    search([], 1, 3) * 10000 = [] * 10000\n    Explanation: If we have a large number of queries, the solution should handle it efficiently without timing out.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this scenario.
