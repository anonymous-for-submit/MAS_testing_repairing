{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

This requires mapping each letter to its position and calculating the total time based on these positions.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the position of each letter on the keyboard.\n- Create a function to compute the total time to type a word based on the calculated positions.\n- Ensure the solution can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Optimize the code for readability and maintainability.\nWe will use Python for this task as it provides a simple and efficient way to handle the requirements. The main challenge is to calculate the minimal time to type a word based on a given keyboard layout. Each letter's position on the keyboard will be mapped, and the total time will be computed by summing the absolute differences in positions of consecutive letters.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a distinct lowercase Latin letter.\n    Explanation: The keyboard is a string of 26 unique characters, each representing a key on the keyboard. The position of each character in the string determines where the corresponding key is located.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To calculate the total time to type a word, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Iterate through the word, calculating the time to move from the current letter to the next letter based on their positions.\n    3. Sum the times for all consecutive letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Typing a word with all keys in a single row.\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: If the word consists of letters that are adjacent on the keyboard, the total time will be 0 because no hand movement is required.\n\n    Edge case 2: Typing a word with keys that are maximally far apart on the keyboard.\n    Expected output: 25\n    Explanation: If the word consists of letters that are at opposite ends of the keyboard, the total time will be the maximum possible movement, which is 25 (since the keys are 26 apart).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan can handle these cases by summing the absolute differences in positions.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the total time to type a word based on the positions of the keys on a keyboard. Each letter's position is determined by its order in the alphabet, and the time to move the hand between keys is the absolute difference in their positions.

For each test case, calculate the total time by iterating through the word s and summing the absolute differences in positions between consecutive letters.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: The positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The total time is the sum of the absolute differences: |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    Expected output: 2\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno\"\n    word = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: The positions of 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o' are 11, 5, 12, 12, and 15 respectively. The total time is the sum of the absolute differences: |11-5| + |5-12| + |12-12| + |12-15| = 6 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 16.\n    Expected output: 16\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already accounts for the positions of the keys and calculates the total time accurately.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout. Each letter's position on the keyboard determines the time taken to type it.
