{"name": "1579_A. Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

The goal is to determine if there's a sequence of such operations that can lead to an empty string by erasing all letters.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times as': indicates the frequency with which a character must appear to be erased.\n    Explanation: For example, if there are two 'A's and two 'B's, Casimir can erase one 'A' and one 'B' in each turn, reducing the counts of 'A' and 'B' by one each time.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'the largest': refers to finding the maximum number of times a character can be erased.\n    Explanation: In this problem, there is no specific degree adverb mentioned, but the concept of maximizing the number of erasures is implicit in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Count the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' in the string.\n    2. Check if the counts of 'A' and 'C' are equal and if the count of 'B' is equal to the sum of the counts of 'A' and 'C'.\n    3. If both conditions are met, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: s = \"ABACAB\"\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The string contains two 'A's, two 'B's, and two 'C's. Casimir can erase one 'A' and one 'B' in the first turn, one 'B' and one 'C' in the second turn, and one 'A' and one 'B' in the third turn, leaving an empty string.\n\n    Edge case 2: s = \"ABC\"\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The string contains one 'A', one 'B', and one 'C'. There is no way to pair and erase 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C' without leaving a character unpaired.\n\n    Edge case 3: s = \"AABBCC\"\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The string contains two 'A's, two 'B's, and two 'C's. Casimir can erase one 'A' and one 'B' in the first turn, one 'B' and one 'C' in the second turn, and one 'A' and one 'C' in the third turn, leaving an empty string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to determine if the string can be fully erased based on the counts of 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to determine if a given string can be fully erased by repeatedly removing 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C'. This requires a simple yet effective algorithm that can handle various string lengths and configurations. The solution should be clear and concise, providing immediate feedback on the erasability of the string.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if the string can be fully erased.\n- Ensure the function works efficiently for strings of up to 50 characters.\n- Allow for user input of multiple test cases to check multiple strings.\n- Provide clear output indicating YES or NO for each test case.\n- Optimize the algorithm for performance, especially for larger inputs.\nTo solve this problem, we will use a simple and efficient approach that checks the string for the possibility of fully erasing it based on the given rules. The approach involves iterating through the string and ensuring that the characters are removed in pairs that match the allowed operations. We will use a stack-based approach to keep track of the characters and their counts, which simplifies the process of checking for valid pairs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing pairs': means removing one 'A' and one 'B' or one 'B' and one 'C' from the string.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is the ability to remove specific pairs of characters from the string, which reduces the string's length by 2 each time an operation is performed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through the string and use a stack to keep track of the characters. For each character, we will check if it can be paired with the last character in the stack (if any) to form a valid pair. If it can, we pop the stack; otherwise, we push the character onto the stack. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all characters were paired correctly, and we can fully erase the string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"ABAB\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"ABAB\" can be processed as follows:\n    - Remove the first 'A' and 'B' to get \"AB\"\n    - Remove the next 'A' and 'B' to get \"\"\n    The string is fully erased, so the output is YES.\n\n    s = \"AABBCC\"\n    expected output = NO\n    Explanation: The string \"AABBCC\" cannot be fully erased because there are no valid pairs to remove all characters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to determine if the string can be fully erased.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires determining if a string can be reduced to an empty string by repeatedly erasing pairs of characters 'A' and 'B', or 'B' and 'C'.

The key observation is that the only valid operations are erasing 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C'. This means that after each operation, the string will have the same number of 'A's and 'B's, and the same number of 'B's and 'C's. Therefore, a valid sequence of operations will only be possible if the string initially has the same number of 'A's as 'C's and the same number of 'B's as 'C's. We can check this condition and return the result accordingly.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing': the process of removing characters from a string\n    'independent turns': each turn's action does not affect the others\n    'valid operations': erasing 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C'\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'one': indicates a single instance of an action\n    'same number': indicates equality in count between two characters\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'any': means no specific restriction on the number of characters\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    For each test case:\n    1.

If both conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"ABACAB\"\n    expected output = NO\n    Explanation: The string has 3 'A's, 2 'B's, and 1 'C'. The counts of 'A's and 'C's are not the same, so it's not possible to fully erase the string.\n\n    s = \"AABBCC\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string has the same number of 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's, so it's possible to erase all characters by alternating between 'A' and 'B', then 'B' and 'C'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

The rules are straightforward: erase one 'A' and one 'B' or erase one 'B' and one 'C'.

The main idea is to check the string for possible pairs of characters that can be erased according to the rules provided.

If at any point we can't find a pair to erase, we will conclude that it's not possible to fully erase the string.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing pairs of characters': This involves removing one instance of 'A' and 'B', or one instance of 'B' and 'C' from the string.\n    Explanation: The problem requires identifying and removing specific pairs of characters to eventually reduce the string to an empty state.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly two': This phrase indicates that each action removes exactly two characters from the string.\n    Explanation: Each turn involves erasing two specific characters, either 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C'.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'arbitrary places': This adverb means that the characters to be erased can be at any positions in the string, not necessarily adjacent.\n    Explanation: The problem allows for flexibility in choosing which instances of the characters to erase, as long as they are part of the string.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
