{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. The movement rules are strict and cover adjacency criteria. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1.

The goal is to determine if we can move from the starting position (1, 1) to the goal position (2, n) without hitting any traps.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm starting from (1, 1) and exploring all possible moves to reach (2, n). We will use a queue to keep track of the current position and the cells to be explored next. For each cell, we will check if it is safe and if it can be reached from the current position. If we reach (2, n), we will return YES; otherwise, if the queue is exhausted without reaching the goal, we will return NO.\n\n# [edge case] \n    test_cases = 1\n    n = 3\n    grid = ['000', '000']\n    expected_output = YES\n    Explanation: In this case, the grid is a 2x3 grid with both starting and ending cells safe. Since the grid is small, a simple traversal from (1, 1) to (2, 3) is possible without hitting any traps.\n\n    test_cases = 1\n    n = 4\n    grid = ['0011', '1100']\n    expected_output = YES\n    Explanation: This grid is also 2x4, but with traps placed strategically. However, there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, 4) that avoids all traps.\n\n    test_cases = 1\n    n = 4\n    grid = ['0111', '1110']\n    expected_output = NO\n    Explanation: In this grid, the traps are arranged in such a way that there is no path from (1, 1) to (2, 4) without hitting at least one trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
