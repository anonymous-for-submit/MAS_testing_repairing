The program must be efficient enough to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries, making it suitable for large datasets.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array.\n- Implement the ability to replace all occurrences of a specified integer with another integer in the array.\n- Ensure the program can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries efficiently.\n- Provide a clear and user-friendly output of the final array after all queries are processed.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use a simple and efficient approach using Python's built-in list data structure. The program will handle two types of queries: adding an element to the end of the list and replacing all occurrences of a specified integer with another integer. We will ensure that the program is efficient enough to handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries by using Python's dynamic array properties.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept here is performing operations on an array, specifically adding elements and replacing specific values.\n    Explanation: We need to handle a sequence of operations on an initially empty array, where each operation can either add an element to the end or replace all occurrences of a specified value with another value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to ensure all instances of a value are replaced, not just the first occurrence.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"replace all occurrences\" means that we need to replace every instance of a specified integer with another integer throughout the entire array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb is not applicable in this context as it does not fit with the operations described in the requirement.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not involve finding the largest integer but rather replacing all occurrences of a specified integer with another integer.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The logic should consider each query type separately:\n    1. For query type \"1 x\", add the element x to the end of the array.\n    2. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    To efficiently handle the replacement, we can use a simple loop to iterate through the array and replace all occurrences of x with y.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 1 1\n    Output: [1]\n    Explanation: The array is initially empty, so after adding the first element, the array becomes [1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 2 1 2\n    Output: [2]\n    Explanation: The array contains only the element 1, and after replacing all occurrences of 1 with 2, the array becomes [2].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 2 3 4\n    Output: []\n    Explanation: The array is initially empty, so there are no occurrences of 3 to replace with 4. The resulting array remains empty.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic already covers the edge cases where the array is initially empty or where no occurrences of the specified integer exist.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 144, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
