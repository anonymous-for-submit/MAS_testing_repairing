{"name": "1579_A. Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

Each turn decreases the length of the string by 2. The goal is to determine if there's a sequence of actions that leads to an empty string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find a condition where the number of 'B's and 'C's allows for their removal in pairs.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that we need to find a way to remove 'A' and 'B' pairs or 'B' and 'C' pairs. This means we need to ensure that the counts of 'B' and 'C' allow for their removal in pairs.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the largest possible number of 'B's and 'C's that can be removed to achieve an empty string.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks to determine if there's a sequence of actions that leads to an empty string. The 'largest' adverb implies that we need to consider the maximum possible removal of 'B' and 'C' pairs.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The algorithm should iterate through the string and count the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

By removing one 'A' and one 'B' from the first two positions, we get \"ACAB\", then remove one 'A' and one 'B' again to get \"CAB\". Finally, remove one 'B' and one 'C' to get an empty string.\n\n    Edge case 2: s = \"AABBCC\"\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The string contains two 'A's, two 'B's, and two 'C's. However, there are no pairs that can be removed to achieve an empty string.\n\n    Edge case 3: s = \"ABCBAC\"\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The string contains two 'A's, two 'B's, and two 'C's. By removing one 'A' and one 'B' from the first and last positions, we get \"CBAC\", then remove one 'B' and one 'C' from the second and fourth positions to get \"A\".

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions: he can either remove one 'A' and one 'B' from any positions in the string (these letters don't need to be next to each other), or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string. Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2, and all turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions. For example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). For a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this? Consider all possible sequences of erase actions and determine if they lead to an empty string.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.
