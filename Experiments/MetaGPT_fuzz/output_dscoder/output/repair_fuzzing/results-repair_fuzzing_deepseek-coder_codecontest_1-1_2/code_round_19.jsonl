{"name": "1618_F. Reverse", "description": "You are given two positive integers x and y. You can perform the following operation with x: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add 0 or 1 to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of x.\n\nFor example: \n\n  * 34 can be turned into 81 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 1, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1010001, which is the binary form of 81. \n  * 34 can be turned into 17 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 10001, which is the binary form of 17. \n  * 81 can be turned into 69 via one operation: the binary form of 81 is 1010001, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1000101, which is the binary form of 69. \n  * 34 can be turned into 69 via two operations: first you turn 34 into 81 and then 81 into 69. \n\n\n\nYour task is to find out whether x can be turned into y after a certain number of operations (possibly zero).\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^{18}).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint YES if you can make x equal to y and NO if you can't.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n\n\nInput\n\n\n7 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\n\n34

You can perform the following operation with x: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add 0 or 1 to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of x. For example: * 34 can be turned into 81 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 1, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1010001, which is the binary form of 81. * 34 can be turned into 17 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 10001, which is the binary form of 17. * 81 can be turned into 69 via one operation: the binary form of 81 is 1010001, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1000101, which is the binary form of 69. * 34 can be turned into 69 via two operations: first you turn 34 into 81 and then 81 into 69. Your task is to find out whether x can be turned into y after a certain number of operations (possibly zero). Try to determine the sequence of operations that leads from x to y. Input The only line of the input contains two integers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^{18}). Output Print YES if you can make x equal to y and NO if you can't.
