{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

For example, for n = 4, the number 17 is special because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to generate the sequence of special numbers for each test case. We will use a mathematical approach to leverage the properties of binary representation to generate these numbers efficiently. Here's a high-level outline of the approach:\n\n    1. Read the number of test cases (t).\n    2. For each test case, read the base number (n) and the position (k) in the sequence.\n    3. Generate the sequence of special numbers for the given base number n.\n    4. Sort the sequence of special numbers.\n    5.

The 1st special number is 1.\n    Expected output: 1\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: n = 3, k = 4\n    Explanation: The sequence for n = 3 is [1, 3, 4, 9, ...], which includes numbers that can be written as sums of different non-negative powers of 3. The 4th special number is 9.\n    Expected output: 9\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: n = 10, k = 1000\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the system's ability to handle larger values of n and k. The 1000th special number in the sequence of base 10 numbers is a large number, and we need to ensure the output is given modulo 10^9+7.\n    Expected output: (The actual output depends on the calculation of the 1000th special number for base 10, modulo 10^9+7)\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, especially when k is very large. The sequence grows exponentially, and we need to ensure that the output is computed modulo 10^9+7 to avoid integer overflow. Here's an example of how to implement the modulo operation:\n\n    ```python\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    def find_kth_special_number(n, k):\n        special_numbers = []\n        power = 0\n        while k > 0:\n            if k % 2 == 1:\n                special_numbers.append(n**power)\n            k //= 2\n            power += 1\n        return sum(special_numbers) % MOD\n\n    # Example usage:\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        print(find_kth_special_number(n, k))\n    ```\n\n    This code snippet reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the base number (n) and the position (k) in the sequence. It then calculates the k-th special number using the binary representation approach and outputs the result modulo 10^9+7.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves finding the k-th special number in a sequence defined by the sum of different non-negative powers of a given base number n.
