The program will read the number of queries and then process each query, modifying the array accordingly. We will use a list to store the array elements and perform operations based on the query type.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements within the array.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to manage an array of integers and perform two types of operations: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that the number of elements in the array can exceed a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase suggests that the frequency of an element in the array should meet or exceed a specific value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb implies that we need to find the largest element in the array.\n    'greatest': Similar to 'largest', it indicates that we need to identify the greatest element based on some criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Read the number of queries.\n    3. For each query:\n        - If the query is of type '1 x', add the element x to the end of the array.\n        - If the query is of type '2 x y', replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    4. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array starts empty, then we add elements 1 and 2, resulting in [1, 2]. When we replace all occurrences of 2 with 2, the array remains [1, 2] because there are no occurrences of 2 to replace.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: The array starts empty. After the first query, it becomes [4]. Adding 1 and 4 results in [4, 1, 4]. Adding 2 results in [4, 1, 4, 2]. Replacing all occurrences of 2 with 4 results in [4, 1, 4, 4]. Replacing all occurrences of 4 with 3 results in [1, 3, 3]. Adding 2 results in [1, 3, 3, 2]. Finally, replacing all occurrences of 2 with 7 results in [1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases in this problem.
