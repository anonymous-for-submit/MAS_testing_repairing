{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

Each special number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of n, which is similar to the binary representation of numbers. We will convert k to its binary form and then compute the corresponding special number by summing the appropriate powers of n.

In such cases, we should return -1 or a message indicating that k is out of range.\n        if k > number_of_special_numbers:\n            return -1\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to find the k-th special number in a sequence defined by the sum of different non-negative powers of n. The output should be modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers. The algorithm must be efficient to handle the upper limits of n and k.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to find the k-th special number in the sequence.\n- Ensure the output is modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers.\n- Optimize the algorithm for efficiency, especially for large values of n and k.\n- Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\n- Provide clear documentation and comments in the code to aid understanding.\nTo solve the problem of finding the k-th special number in a sequence defined by the sum of different non-negative powers of n, we will use a mathematical approach based on the properties of binary numbers. Each special number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of n, which is similar to representing numbers in a binary system where each bit represents a power of n. This approach allows us to efficiently generate the k-th special number without having to generate the entire sequence up to k. We will use modular arithmetic to ensure that the output remains within the required bounds.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special numbers': numbers that can be expressed as a sum of different non-negative powers of a base number n.\n    Explanation: These numbers are akin to binary numbers but with base n. For example, for n = 4, the number 17 is special because it can be expressed as 4^0 + 4^2 (1 + 16 = 17).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we are looking for numbers greater than a certain value.\n    Explanation: In the context of special numbers, we need to find numbers that can be expressed as sums of distinct powers of n, which means we are looking for numbers greater than the largest power of n that can be summed.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates the maximum value in a sequence.\n    Explanation: In the context of special numbers, the largest number we need to consider is determined by the highest power of n that can be summed without repetition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To find the k-th special number, we can use a mathematical approach based on the properties of binary numbers. Each special number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of n. We can generate the k-th special number by converting k to a base-n representation and summing the corresponding powers of n.\n\n# [edge case] \n    k = 1, n = 2\n    expected output = 1\n    Explanation: For n = 2, the first special number is 1, which is 2^0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where k = 1. In this case, we should directly return 1 as the first special number.\n        if k == 1:\n            return 1\n\n    (other code)\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 149, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "parent_index": 149}
