The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the replacement operation correctly.\n\n# [code logic continued]\n    Here's a detailed implementation of the code logic:\n    ```python\n    def process_queries(queries):\n        arr = []\n        for query in queries:\n            if query[0] == '1':\n                arr.append(int(query[1]))\n            elif query[0] == '2':\n                x, y = int(query[1]), int(query[2])\n                for i in range(len(arr)):\n                    if arr[i] == x:\n                        arr[i] = y\n        return arr\n\n    # Example usage:\n    queries = [\n        '1 3',\n        '1 1',\n        '2 1 2',\n        '1 2',\n        '1 1',\n        '1 2',\n        '2 1 3'\n    ]\n    result = process_queries(queries)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n    ```\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The array initially is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. After processing the queries, the array should reflect the replacements as specified in the requirement. The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle the replacement operation correctly.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify a program that manages an array of integers and performs two types of operations on it. The first type adds an element to the end of the array, and the second type replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another element. The program must handle a potentially large number of queries efficiently, which implies that the solution should be optimized for performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should handle the addition of elements to the array efficiently.\n- The code should handle the replacement of elements in the array efficiently.\n- The user interface should be responsive and provide clear feedback.\n- The program should be optimized for handling a large number of queries.\nWe will use Python, leveraging its built-in list data structure to efficiently manage the array of integers. For handling the queries, we will iterate through each query and perform the necessary operations based on the query type. The list will be updated in-place to reflect the changes after each query.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept here is managing an array of integers and performing operations on it, such as adding elements and replacing specific values.\n    Explanation: We need to handle an array where elements can be added and specific elements can be replaced based on given queries.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to consider elements that appear more than a certain number of times.\n    'at least as many times': This phrase suggests that we need to find elements that appear at least as many times as their value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the given conditions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", add the element x to the end of the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x in the array with y.\n    5. Return the resulting array after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    edge_case1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n    Explanation: In this edge case, we have a list with multiple occurrences of the same number.
