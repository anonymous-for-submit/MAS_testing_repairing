{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The program must handle multiple test cases efficiently, considering different keyboard layouts and word lengths. The solution should be robust and adaptable to various inputs, ensuring accurate and quick results.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate typing time based on keyboard layout\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently\n- Ensure compatibility with different keyboard layouts\n- Optimize performance for words of varying lengths\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a custom keyboard layout. The function will first read the number of test cases, then for each test case, it will read the keyboard layout and the word to be typed. The function will then calculate the time required to type the word based on the given keyboard layout. The time will be calculated based on the position of each character in the keyboard layout.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': refers to the specific arrangement of characters on a keyboard, which can differ from the standard alphabetical order.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 characters, each representing a unique position on the keyboard. This layout can be different from the standard QWERTY or AZERTY layout, and the goal is to calculate the time required to type a given word based on this custom layout.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that the value of an integer is greater than another integer.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than\" is used to specify that the integer must appear more times than its own value in the list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates that the integer being compared is the biggest among others.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"largest\" is used to specify that the function should return the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing more times than its own value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan outlines a clear approach to solve the problem:\n    1.

Read the keyboard layout and the word 's'.\n    2. Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Iterate through the word 's' and calculate the time based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n    4. Sum the times for all letters in the word to get the total time.\n    5. Output the total time for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The number 3 appears 3 times, which is more than or equal to its value, and it is the largest number that meets this condition.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: In this case, the list is [3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]. The numbers 2, 3, and 4 appear 1, 2, and 3 times respectively, but none of them appear more than or equal to their value. Therefore, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where no integer meets the condition by returning -1.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 168, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
