Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). \n\n\n\nHelp them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\nIn total, it takes 39 energy.\n\nIn the second query, the illusion rate of the 1-st room changes from 10 to -3.\n\nIn the third query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\n\n\nNow, it takes 32 energy.", "tags": ["data structures", "trees"], "difficulty": 15, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "6 4\n10

To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 -

He wants to build a housing complex in the city.\n\nThere are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid a of size (n + 1) \u00d7 (m + 1). There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m. Help him by finding the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m < 2000) \u2014 the size of the grid.\n\nThen (n + 1) lines follow, each containing (m + 1) integers a_{i, j} (0 \u2264 a_{i, j} \u2264 1) \u2014 the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2 2\n101\n000\n000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n18\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n10010\n00000\n01000\n00001\n00100\n00010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n36\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first example, the nearest telephone pole for the points (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1) is at (0, 0). While the nearest telephone pole for the points (0, 2), (1,2), and (2,2) is at (0, 2). Thus, \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}} = (0 + 1 + 4) + (1 + 2 + 5) + (0 + 1 + 4) = 18.", "tags": ["data structures", "geometry"], "difficulty": 20, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "2

The Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\n    'telephone poles': Points in the grid where a_{x, y} = 1.\n\n    'sum of squares': The sum of the squares of the distances to the nearest pole for all points in the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'sum': The total sum of squares of distances for all points in the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'nearest': Indicates the smallest distance to a telephone pole.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the distance to the nearest pole for each point in the grid. We will initialize a queue with all the positions of the telephone poles and perform BFS to fill a distance matrix where each cell contains the distance to the nearest pole. Finally, we will sum up the squares of these distances to get the desired result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input:\n    1 1\n    1\n    1\n\n    Output:\n    2\n\n    Explanation:\n    There is only one pole at (0, 0) and one point at (1, 1). The distance to the nearest pole is 1, and the sum of squares of distances is 1^2 = 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle this edge case as it is a simple scenario with only one pole and one point. The logic provided in the plan will work without modification.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the sum of squares of Euclidean distances from each point in the grid to the nearest telephone pole. This involves identifying the positions of telephone poles and computing distances efficiently. The solution should handle edge cases, such as when there are no telephone poles, ensuring the output is accurate and efficient.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the distance from each point to the nearest telephone pole.\n- Ensure the function can handle large grids efficiently.\n- Handle edge cases where there are no telephone poles.\n- Optimize the code for performance and readability.\n- Provide clear and accurate output as per the given requirements.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling mathematical operations. We will employ a brute-force approach to calculate the distance from each point to the nearest telephone pole. This method will involve iterating through each point in the grid and checking the distance to all telephone poles, updating the minimum distance found. We will use a nested loop to iterate through each point and a separate function to calculate the Euclidean distance. The sum of all S(x, y) values will be computed by summing up the results of the distance function for each point in the grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Euclidean distance': The distance between two points in a plane, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, where the distance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the coordinates.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Read the input to get the size of the grid and the positions of the telephone poles.\n    2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of all S(x, y) values.\n    3. Iterate through each point (x, y) in the grid.\n    4. For each point, find the nearest telephone pole by checking the distance to all telephone poles and keeping track of the minimum distance.\n    5. Calculate S(x, y) as the square of the minimum distance found.\n    6. Add the value of S(x, y) to the sum.\n    7. After iterating through all points, return the sum.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: When the grid is very small, e.g., n = 0, m = 0.\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: There is only one point (0, 0) and one telephone pole at (0, 0). The distance is 0, and S(0, 0) = 0^2 = 0. However, since there is at least one telephone pole, the sum should be 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: When there are no telephone poles, which is not mentioned in the problem but could occur in some edge cases.\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: If there are no telephone poles, the sum of S(x, y) for all points will be 0 because the distance to the nearest pole is infinite.\n\n    Edge case 3: When the grid is large, e.g., n = 1999, m = 1999.\n    Expected output: A large number, as the distance calculations will be extensive.\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the efficiency of the algorithm when dealing with the maximum possible grid size.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

This involves a combinatorial approach to try different distributions and calculate the differences. The solution should be efficient and handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the minimal possible difference in concert durations.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Develop a clear and concise algorithm to distribute songs into concerts.\n- Test the solution with a variety of inputs to ensure accuracy and robustness.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use a combinatorial approach to try different distributions of songs into two concerts. We will calculate the total duration of songs for each distribution and then find the absolute difference between the two concert durations. The goal is to minimize this difference. Given the constraints, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling large numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distribution': means dividing the songs into two groups such that each song is included in exactly one group.\n    'minimal possible difference': means finding the smallest absolute difference between the total durations of the two groups.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'as small as possible': means that we need to minimize the absolute difference between the two concert durations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible distributions of the songs into two concerts and calculate the absolute difference for each distribution.

The eversion operation can be efficiently implemented using a stable partition function, which will help us split the array into two parts based on the pivot element. We will iterate through the array, performing eversions until the array no longer changes. To optimize the process, we will use a function to check if the array has stabilized between eversions.

This process is repeated iteratively until the array configuration no longer changes.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find elements greater than the pivot.\n    Explanation: For example, in the array [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the pivot is 3. The elements more than 3 are [4, 5], which form the right part of the partition.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the largest element in the array to use as the pivot.\n    Explanation: In the array [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the largest element is 5, which is used as the pivot for the first eversion.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the eversion operation, we need to:\n    1.

The array is then reconstructed by concatenating these two parts while maintaining their relative order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find an integer that appears more than its value in the array.\n    Explanation: For example, if an integer appears 3 times in the array, it must be greater than 2 (since 2 * 2 < 3).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing more than its value.\n    Explanation: For example, if the array contains integers 2, 3, and 4, the largest integer that appears more than its value is 4 (since 2 * 2 < 3 and 3 * 2 < 4).\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

After the first eversion, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is the same as the original array. Therefore, the number of eversions required is 1.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: The array is sorted in descending order. The pivot is the first element (5).

Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

"Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner.

These keys are arranged sequentially in one row, each key occupying a specific position from left to right, in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. The word consists entirely of lowercase Latin letters, matching the set available on the keyboard. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n-------\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time it takes to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.

Minimum Extraction", "description": "Yelisey has an array a of n integers.\n\nIf a has length strictly greater than 1, then Yelisei can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it: \n\n  1. First, Yelisei finds the minimal number m in the array. If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them. \n  2. Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero).

The main challenge is to compare two numbers based on their numeric value and the number of trailing zeros. We will use string manipulation to handle the zeros and direct comparison for the numeric values.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'trailing zeros': The number of zeros at the end of a number, which can be determined by counting the number of zeros following the numeric part.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the numbers are represented as a positive integer x followed by p zeros. The number of trailing zeros (p) affects the comparison of the numbers, as it shifts the decimal point.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that one number has a greater number of trailing zeros compared to another.\n    Explanation: For example, if we have two numbers 100 (which is 1 followed by 2 zeros) and 10 (which is 1 followed by 1 zero), the first number is said to have 'more than' the second number in terms of trailing zeros.\n    Implementation: To implement this in code, we can compare the number of zeros (p) in each number.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that a number has the most trailing zeros among all numbers being compared.\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, the largest number will have the highest count of trailing zeros.\n    Implementation: To implement this in code, we can compare the number of zeros (p) in each number.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To compare the two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Remove the trailing zeros from both numbers to compare their numeric values directly.\n    2. Compare the lengths of the numbers without their trailing zeros.\n    3. If the lengths are equal, compare the numeric values.\n    4. If the lengths are not equal, the number with the longer length (more trailing zeros) is larger.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 1000000, 0]) = 1\n    Explanation: The number 1 (which is 1 followed by 0 zeros) is compared with 1000000 (which is 1 followed by 6 zeros). Since the first number has fewer trailing zeros, it is considered smaller.\n    search([10, 100000, 5]) = 10\n    Explanation: The number 10 (which is 1 followed by 1 zero) is compared with 100000 (which is 1 followed by 5 zeros). Since the first number has fewer trailing zeros, it is considered smaller.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The comparison logic already accounts for numbers with trailing zeros.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need to compare two numbers, each described by an integer x followed by a count of zeros p. The output should indicate whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number.

Read the number of test cases t.\n    2. For each test case, read the descriptions of the two numbers.\n    3. Compare the values of x and the number of zeros p to determine the result of the comparison.\n    4. Output the result for each test case.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 1]) = 1\n    Explanation: In this edge case, both x and p are 1, meaning both numbers are 10. They are equal in value and number of trailing zeros.\n    search([1000000, 0], [1, 6]) = 1\n    Explanation: Here, the first number is 1000000 (x = 1 and p = 6 zeros), and the second number is 1000000 (x = 1 and p = 0 zeros). The first number is greater because it has more trailing zeros.\n    search([1, 0], [2, 0]) = -1\n    Explanation: Both numbers have the same number of trailing zeros, but the value of x in the first number (1) is less than that in the second number (2). Therefore, the first number is smaller.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The comparison logic can handle cases where x or p are at their boundaries or when they are equal.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for a tool that can compare two numbers, each described by an integer x and the number of zeros p added to it.

The approach involves comparing the number of digits before the appended zeros and then comparing the numbers themselves if the counts are equal. This method ensures that we handle large numbers and a large number of test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive integer': means the number is greater than 0\n    'appended zeros': means adding zeros at the end of the number\n    'comparison': means to compare the two numbers based on their values and the number of zeros added\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'with p zeros added': means the number is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of p\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greater than': means the first number is larger than the second number\n    'smaller than': means the first number is smaller than the second number\n    'equal to': means the first number is equal to the second number\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Compare the number of zeros (p1 and p2) first.

Poisoned Dagger", "description": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough

The key idea is to balance the heights of the towers by moving blocks from the taller towers to the shorter ones. The minimum possible ugliness can be achieved when all towers have the same height, which is the average height of the towers. This can be done by moving blocks from the towers that are taller than the average to the towers that are shorter than the average. The minimum possible ugliness is then the difference between the maximum and minimum heights after balancing.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'balancing blocks': The process of moving blocks from taller towers to shorter ones to equalize their heights.\n    Explanation: The goal is to minimize the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings by redistributing blocks.

You can perform the following operation with x: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add 0 or 1 to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of x. For example: * 34 can be turned into 81 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 1, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1010001, which is the binary form of 81. * 34 can be turned into 17 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 10001, which is the binary form of 17. * 81 can be turned into 69 via one operation: the binary form of 81 is 1010001, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1000101, which is the binary form of 69. * 34 can be turned into 69 via two operations: first you turn 34 into 81 and then 81 into 69. Your task is to find out whether x can be turned into y after a certain number of operations (possibly zero). Try to determine the sequence of operations that leads from x to y. Input The only line of the input contains two integers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^{18}). Output Print YES if you can make x equal to y and NO if you can't.

Return \"YES\" if they are identical, otherwise return \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    is_square(\"a\") = NO\n    Explanation: The string \"a\" has a length of 1, which is not even, so it cannot be a square string.\n    is_square(\"abab\") = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"abab\" can be split into \"ab\" and \"ab\", which are identical, so it is a square string.\n    is_square(\"abcd\") = NO\n    Explanation: The string \"abcd\" can be split into \"ab\" and \"cd\", which are not identical, so it is not a square string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

In this context, it refers to a list of integers where each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the integer must appear a number of times greater than its value.\n    Explanation: For example, if an integer appears 3 times, it must be greater than 3.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the greatest or highest value that meets the condition.\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, finding the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself means identifying the highest integer in the list that meets the frequency condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Read the input values for n and q.\n    2. Read the permutation p.\n    3. Process each query:\n        - For type 1 query, swap the elements at positions x and y in the permutation.\n        - For type 2 query, determine the value at position i after applying the permutation k times.\n    4. Output the results of type 2 queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1]) = 1\n    explanation: With only one element, it automatically meets the condition since it appears as many times as its value.\n    search([2, 2]) = 2\n    explanation: The number 2 appears twice, which is more than its value, so it is the answer.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The condition for the edge case is already covered by the requirement.\n\n# [core concept]\n    'query handling': processing multiple types of queries efficiently.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling two types of queries: swapping elements in a permutation and determining the value after multiple permutations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least as many times': means the frequency must be greater than or equal to the value.\n    Explanation: For example, if an integer appears 3 times, it must be at least 3.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greatest': means the highest value that meets the condition.\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, finding the greatest integer that appears at least as many times as itself means identifying the highest integer in the list that meets the frequency condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1.

After adding 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, and 2, the array is [3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. Replacing all instances of 1 with 2 results in [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2].

Your task is to find a permutation p that maximizes this surprise\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

However, since we need the sum of these products, we multiply by the number of pairs, which is 3 (since there are 3 pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3)).

Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

Each bit in the binary representation of k corresponds to a power of n that is included in the sum. For example, if k is 5 (binary 101), it means the special number includes n^2 and n^0, but not n^1.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Convert k to its binary representation.\n    2. Iterate through each bit of the binary representation.\n    3. For each bit that is set (1), add the corresponding power of n to the sum.\n    4. Return the sum modulo 10^9+7.\n\n# [edge case] \n    k = 1, n = 2\n    expected output = 1\n    Explanation: When k is 1, it corresponds to not using any power of n, so the special number is n^0 which is 1.\n\n    k = 10^9, n = 3\n    expected output = 129\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 10^9 is a sequence of 1s, meaning all powers of 3 from 3^0 to 3^(number of bits in binary representation of 10^9) are included. The sum modulo 10^9+7 is 129.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where k is very large. Since Python's built-in integers can handle very large numbers, we can directly compute the sum of powers without additional code. However, for languages with limited integer size, we would need to implement modular arithmetic to handle very large k.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve identifying the k-th special number in a sequence generated by summing different non-negative powers of n, modulo 10^9+7.

Instead, we use the precomputed powers of n modulo 10^9+7 to quickly find the k-th special number.\n\n    Edge case 2: n is minimal (e.g., n = 2)\n    Expected output: The k-th special number modulo 10^9+7.\n    Explanation: When n is minimal, the sequence of special numbers can grow very quickly, especially for large k.

Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

Specifically, we will check if the number of 'A's and 'B's combined is even, and if the number of 'B's and 'C's combined is even.

Removing the first or fourth element results in a sequence where two elements satisfy a_i = i.\n\n    Edge Case 2:\n    Input: 7\n    2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation: The sequence [2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7] can be reduced to [2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 7], then [1, 2, 5, 3, 7], and finally [1, 2, 3], where f(a) = 3.\n\n    Edge Case 3:\n    Input: 5\n    1 2 3 4 5\n    Output: 5\n    Explanation: The sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is already in the form where a_i = i for all i, so no elements need to be removed, and f(a) = 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases as the provided logic already covers the edge cases by checking each possible removal and its effect on the function f(a). The greedy approach ensures that we are always maximizing f(a) by considering the best possible removal at each step.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires finding the maximum value of f(a), where f(a) is the number of indices where a_i = i. The user can remove elements from the sequence and concatenate the remaining elements. The goal is to maximize f(a) by using zero or more operations. The solution should be optimal in terms of the number of indices where a_i = i.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate f(a)\n- Allow the user to remove elements from the sequence\n- Concatenate the remaining elements\n- Maximize the value of f(a)\n- Ensure the solution is optimal in terms of the number of indices where a_i = i\nTo solve this problem, we will use a simple and efficient approach that involves iterating through the sequence to count the number of indices where a_i = i. We will then consider removing each element and recalculate f(a) to find the maximum value. This approach will be efficient enough to handle the input size constraints.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence indexing': means that the elements in the sequence are indexed from 1 to n, and we need to find the number of indices where a_i = i.\n    'removing elements': means we can remove any number of elements from the sequence to maximize f(a).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

Removing any element will not increase f(a) since the remaining elements will still have no matching indices.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 3\n           1 2 3\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: The initial sequence has f(a) = 3 because all indices match their values.

Let x = a_n, and then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The sequence of elements within each part remains unchanged as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor instance, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion proceeds as follows: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe begin with the array a and carry out eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing.

This is crucial for understanding the eversion operation.\n    Explanation: In the eversion operation, the array is partitioned based on a pivot element (x), and the partitioning is stable, meaning the relative order of elements within each part remains unchanged.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the pivot element (x) must be strictly greater than the elements in the left part and less than or equal to the elements in the right part.\n    Explanation: For example, in the array [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the pivot x = 3 will partition the array into [2, 1, 3] (left part) and [4, 5] (right part).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Refers to the pivot element (x) that results in the most stable partitioning of the array, meaning the array stops changing after the partitioning.\n    Explanation: The largest pivot will lead to the most significant change in the array, and finding this pivot helps determine the number of eversions needed for the array to stop changing.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

The number of eversions is 0.\n\n    Edge case 2: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] = 4\n    Explanation: The array is in descending order, so each partitioning step will result in a stable array with one element in the left part and the rest in the right part. The number of eversions required is 4.\n\n    Edge case 3: [2, 1, 3, 3, 2] = 2\n    Explanation: The array has multiple elements, and the partitioning will proceed as usual, with the array stabilizing after a certain number of eversions.

The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon.

BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the goal. The algorithm will check each cell in the grid to ensure it is safe before moving to the next cell. We will implement this in a Python function that takes the number of test cases and the grid details as input and returns 'YES' if the path is safe, otherwise 'NO'.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid navigation': navigating through a 2xN grid using BFS, ensuring all cells are safe.\n    Explanation: The grid consists of two rows and N columns. The goal is to move from the starting cell (1, 1) to the goal cell (2, n) without falling into any traps. The character '0' represents a safe cell, and '1' represents a trap cell.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the BFS algorithm, we need to:\n    1.

Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right, diagonal) from the current cell, ensuring the move is within the grid and the cell is safe.\n    4. If the goal cell (2, n) is reached, return 'YES'.\n    5.

The core logic of the BFS will handle the edge cases by ensuring all cells are safe before moving to the next cell.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game is a simple grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate through the grid avoiding traps. The player starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, n). The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid description. The output should indicate if the level can be completed or not.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game logic to check if the player can reach the end without triggering a trap.\n- Develop a user interface that allows the player to input and view the game state.\n- Ensure the game is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game logic. The game logic will be encapsulated in a Python function that takes the grid as input and returns 'YES' if the player can reach the end without triggering a trap, otherwise 'NO'. The function will check each possible path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n) to ensure no traps are encountered.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': The core concept involves navigating a 2xN grid, where the goal is to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without stepping on any traps.\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2-row by N-column matrix, and the character can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The goal is to find a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, n) without crossing any cells marked as traps.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a simple approach to check each possible path from (1, 1) to (2, n). This can be implemented by checking each cell in the grid to see if it's safe to move to from the previous cell. The function will need to iterate through the grid, checking each cell's neighbors to ensure they are within bounds and do not contain traps.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1: n = 3, grid = ['000', '010']\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The grid is too small (3 columns) for the character to move from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without crossing a trap. The only path would involve the character moving through the trap at (2, 2), which is not possible.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 4, grid = ['0000', '0010']\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid allows for a path from (1, 1) to (2, 4) without crossing any traps. The character can move down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally down to (2, 4).\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 5, grid = ['00000', '00001']\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The character can reach the bottom row, but there's a trap at (2, 5), blocking the path. The character would need to move through this trap to complete the level.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic can be extended to check for traps at the end of the grid traversal. If a trap is found at (2, n), the function can return 'NO'. Otherwise, it can return 'YES'.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 38, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The key function will:\n    1. Split each string into two parts: odd-indexed characters and even-indexed characters.\n    2. Sort the odd-indexed characters in ascending order.\n    3. Sort the even-indexed characters in descending order.\n    4. Concatenate the sorted odd and even parts to form the key for sorting.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 1 1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: Since there's only one string, it is trivially sorted.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 2 2\n    Output: 1 2\n    Explanation: For two strings of equal length, sorting by the custom criteria will yield the order based on the first character's odd-even index positions.\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: 3 3\n    Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: For three strings, the sorting will consider the odd and even indexed characters as specified in the problem statement.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for handling edge cases as the provided logic inherently handles them by sorting based on the custom criteria.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": false, "pass": false, "pass_num": 0, "round": 39, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n

can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete

Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the

into two parts: left and right, with the left part containing elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x) and the right part containing elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The sequence of elements within each part remains unchanged as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor instance, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion proceeds as follows: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe begin with the array a and carry out eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of eversions after which the array stops changing. This involves repeatedly partitioning the array based on a pivot element and checking if the array has stabilized. The solution should be efficient enough to handle large inputs within the given constraints.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the eversion operation and check for array stabilization.\n- Optimize the algorithm for large inputs to ensure performance.\n- Ensure the solution provides the correct output for each test case.\n- Test the solution with various test cases to verify its correctness.\n- Document the code and provide clear instructions for usage.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to implement the eversion operation and check for array stabilization. We will use a loop to repeatedly apply the eversion operation until the array stops changing. To optimize the algorithm for large inputs, we will use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary computations.

Process query 2 to calculate the minimum sum of energy required to reach the treasure from a given room.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Query type 2 with u = 1 and v = n (starting from the entrance and ending at the deepest room).\n    Expected output: The minimum sum of energy needed to reach the treasure.\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the traversal from the entrance to the deepest room, ensuring the algorithm can handle long paths.\n\n    Edge case 2: Query type 1 with u = n (changing the illusion rate of the deepest room).\n    Expected output: The updated labyrinth configuration with the new illusion rate.\n    Explanation: This edge case tests the dynamic update capability, ensuring the system can handle changes in labyrinth conditions.\n\n    Edge case 3: Query type 2 with u = v (starting and ending in the same room).\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: This edge case ensures the algorithm correctly handles the scenario where no energy is required to traverse a path of length zero.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The lexicographically smallest permutation is the one where the characters are in ascending order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we need to generate all permutations of S and check if T is a subsequence of each permutation. If T is not a subsequence, we return that permutation as the result. This approach is straightforward but may not be efficient for large strings due to the factorial growth of permutations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test Case 1:\n    S = \"abc\"\n    T = \"abc\"\n    Expected Output: \"acb\"\n    Explanation: The permutation \"acb\" is the lexicographically smallest permutation of \"abc\" that does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n\n    Test Case 2:\n    S = \"aabb\"\n    T = \"abc\"\n    Expected Output: \"abac\"\n    Explanation: The permutation \"abac\" is the lexicographically smallest permutation of \"aabb\" that does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic will generate permutations and check for the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases efficiently. Given the constraints, we should optimize the permutation generation to avoid unnecessary computations. One approach is to use a backtracking algorithm with pruning to generate only those permutations that do not contain T as a subsequence.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of S that does not contain T as a subsequence.

You have to type the word s on this keyboard. The word consists entirely of lowercase Latin letters, matching the set available on the keyboard. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one, and to type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively, and therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.

Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":
