{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each test case consists of a keyboard layout and a word, and the goal is to output the minimal time required to type the word based on the given keyboard. The challenge lies in mapping the word to the keyboard efficiently, considering the unique layout.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word on a custom keyboard layout\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for different word lengths and keyboard layouts\n- Provide clear and concise output for each test case\n- Test the solution with various edge cases\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to calculate the time it takes to type a word on a custom keyboard layout. We will create a function that takes a keyboard layout and a word as input and returns the minimal time required to type the word. We will also handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': refers to the specific arrangement of characters on a keyboard, which can differ from the standard alphabetical order.\n    'minimal time': the shortest amount of time required to type a word on a given keyboard layout.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    word = \"code\"\n    Explanation: The standard keyboard layout is used, so the time to type \"code\" is the length of the word, which is 4.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\"\n    word = \"hello\"\n    Explanation: The keyboard layout is completely different from the standard one. The time to type \"hello\" would be the sum of the positions of each character in the keyboard layout. For example, 'h' is at position 8, 'e' is at position 5, and so on. The total time is 8 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 52.\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    keyboard = \"mnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq\"\n    word = \"world\"\n    Explanation: Another unique keyboard layout. The time to type \"world\" would be the sum of the positions of each character in the keyboard layout. For example, 'w' is at position 23, 'o' is at position 15, and so on. The total time is 23 + 15 + 18 + 12 + 4 = 72.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

Additional requirements include handling multiple test cases efficiently and ensuring the solution is scalable for different word lengths and keyboard layouts.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate typing time for a single word on a custom keyboard\n- Extend the function to handle multiple test cases\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for different word lengths\n- Allow for easy addition of new keyboard layouts\n- Include user interface elements for easy input and output of data\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the minimal time required to type a given word on a custom keyboard layout. The function will first map each character in the word to its position on the custom keyboard, then calculate the total time based on the position. We will use a simple and efficient approach to handle multiple test cases efficiently and ensure the solution is scalable for different word lengths and keyboard layouts.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': refers to the specific arrangement of characters on a keyboard, which can differ from the standard alphabetical order.\n    Explanation: In this problem, the keyboard layout is given as a string of 26 characters, where each character is unique and represents a specific position on the keyboard. The goal is to calculate the minimal time required to type a given word on this custom keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the value is greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': means that the frequency of an integer is greater than or equal to its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimal': means the smallest possible amount or degree of something.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Map each character in the word to its position on the custom keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the total time based on the position of each character in the word.\n    3. Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"abc\"\n    Explanation: The word \"abc\" will be typed in the order of 'a', 'b', and 'c' on the custom keyboard. Since each character is in the first position, the total time is 3.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"z\"\n    Explanation: The word \"z\" will be typed in the last position on the custom keyboard. The total time is 1.\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"ba\"\n    Explanation: The word \"ba\" will be typed with 'b' taking longer to reach than 'a' due to its position at the end of the keyboard. The total time is 2.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic can handle any word and keyboard layout within the given constraints.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 166, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
