For managing the queries, we will parse each query string to determine its type and parameters, then perform the corresponding operations on the list. This approach ensures that the system can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing an array (list) of integers and performing operations such as appending elements and replacing specific elements with others.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty array, where each operation can either add an element to the end of the array or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    Explanation: In the context of the requirement, 'more than' is used to specify the number of times an element should be present in the array for a replacement operation.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb describes the maximum value in a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, 'largest' is used to find the maximum integer in the array that meets a specific condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the code, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1. Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    2. Iterate through each query.\n    3. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the array.\n    4. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    5. After processing all queries, return the resulting array.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: 4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n    Output: 1 2 1\n    Explanation: The array initially has elements [1, 2, 1]. After the replacement query, all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 2, resulting in the array [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: 8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n    Output: 1 3 3 7\n    Explanation: The array undergoes multiple changes:\n    - Initial array is empty.\n    - After query \"2 1 4\", the array becomes [4].\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array becomes [4, 1].\n    - After query \"1 4\", the array becomes [4, 1, 4].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array becomes [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - After query \"2 2 4\", all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 4, resulting in [4, 1, 4, 4].\n    - After query \"2 4 3\", all occurrences of 4 are replaced with 3, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 3].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 2].\n    - After query \"2 2 7\", all occurrences of 2 are replaced with 7, resulting in [3, 1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
