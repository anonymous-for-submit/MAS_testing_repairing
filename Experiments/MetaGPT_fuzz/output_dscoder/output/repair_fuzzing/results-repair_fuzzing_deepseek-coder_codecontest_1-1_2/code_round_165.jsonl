The function f(a) calculates the number of indices where a_i equals i. The solution should be able to handle sequences of up to 2 * 10^5 elements, making it a challenge for any algorithm. The goal is to maximize f(a) by removing zero or more elements, which can be achieved by strategically removing elements to form the largest possible sequence where a_i equals i.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement an efficient algorithm to find the largest possible f(a)\n- Ensure the solution is scalable to large input sizes\n- Optimize the removal of elements for maximum f(a)\n- Provide clear instructions and outputs\n- Include user-friendly interface for easy interaction\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use a combination of data structures and algorithms. The main challenge is to find the largest possible f(a) by removing elements from the sequence. We will use a list to store the sequence and a set to keep track of the indices where a_i equals i. We will iterate through the sequence and for each element, we will check if it satisfies the condition a_i == i. If it does, we will add it to a temporary list. If it doesn't, we will remove the element and check the next one. We will repeat this process until we find the maximum f(a).\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'sequence manipulation': understanding how to remove elements from a sequence to maximize a function value.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to manipulate the sequence by removing elements to optimize a specific function, in this case, maximizing the value of f(a) which calculates the number of indices where a_i equals i.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find indices where a_i > i.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to find indices where a_i >= i.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means that we need to find the maximum value of f(a) by removing elements.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution efficiently, we need to:\n    1.
