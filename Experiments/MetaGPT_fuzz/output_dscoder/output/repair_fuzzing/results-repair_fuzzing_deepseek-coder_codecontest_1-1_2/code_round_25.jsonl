The GCDs of the indices are 1 for (1, 2), 2 for (1, 3), and 1 for (2, 3). The results are (2 * 1) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 1) = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. However, since we need the sum of these products, we multiply by the number of pairs, which is 3 (since there are 3 pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3)). Thus, the total is 8 * 3 = 24.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, a = [6, 10, 15, 30]\n    Expected output: 110\n    Explanation: We need to calculate the GCD of all pairs and their indices. For example, for the pair (1, 2) with elements 6 and 10, the GCD is 2, and the GCD of indices 1 and 2 is 1. The result is 2 * 1 = 2. We need to do this for all pairs and sum the results. The final sum modulo 10^9 + 7 is the output.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
