The operations need to be performed efficiently, especially with a large number of queries.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add elements to the array.\n- Allow substitution of elements in the array.\n- Ensure the application can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for array management.\n- Optimize the application for performance, especially with large datasets.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use a simple and efficient approach using Python's built-in list data structure. The list will be dynamically managed based on the queries received. For each query of type '2', we will replace all occurrences of the specified element with another element. The final output will be the list after processing all queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array manipulation': The core concept involves managing a list of integers where elements can be added, and existing elements can be replaced based on specific queries.\n    Explanation: This requires the ability to handle both addition and replacement operations efficiently, which is typical in data structures like lists in programming.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of occurrences of a specific value needs to be considered.\n    'at least as many times': Specifies the minimum frequency a value must appear to be considered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Refers to finding the largest integer in the array that meets certain criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type '1 x', append 'x' to the list.\n        - If the query is of type '2 x y', replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list.\n    - Return the final list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears 3 times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is not present, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers the edge case where no integer meets the criteria by initializing the result to -1 and checking for the largest integer that meets the criteria.\n\n# [code logic]\n    - Initialize an empty list `arr`.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is '1 x', append `x` to `arr`.\n        - If the query is '2 x y', replace all occurrences of `x` with `y` in `arr`.\n    - Return the final list `arr`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears 3 times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    explanation: The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is not present, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan already covers the edge case where no integer meets the criteria by initializing the result to -1 and checking for the largest integer that meets the criteria.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 124, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
