The array should correctly handle the replacement of zero, which is a special case in arithmetic operations.\n    query = \"1 5\" * 10^5 = [5, 5, ..., 5] (5 repeated 10^5 times)\n    Explanation: This is an edge case where the array is populated with the same large number multiple times. The system should handle large arrays efficiently.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling the edge case)\n    For large numbers and large arrays, we should consider optimizing memory usage and performance to avoid excessive memory consumption or slow execution times. This might involve using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 78, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
