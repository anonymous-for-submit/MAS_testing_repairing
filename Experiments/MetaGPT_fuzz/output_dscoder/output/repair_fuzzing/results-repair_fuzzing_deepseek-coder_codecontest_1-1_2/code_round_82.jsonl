{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":
