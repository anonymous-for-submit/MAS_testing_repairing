{"name": "1579_A. Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

This is a good approach as it allows for efficient checking of possible pairs for removal.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"ABAB\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"ABAB\" can be reduced to an empty string by first erasing the first 'A' and 'B', then the next 'A' and 'B', leaving an empty string.\n    s = \"AABBCC\"\n    expected output = NO\n    Explanation: The string \"AABBCC\" cannot be reduced to an empty string by the allowed operations. There are no consecutive 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C' to erase.\n    s = \"ABCBAC\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"ABCBAC\" can be reduced to an empty string by erasing 'B' and 'C' first, then 'A' and 'B', and finally 'A' and 'C'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The provided logic in the plan is sufficient to determine if the string can be reduced to an empty string.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to determine if a given string can be fully erased by a sequence of actions.

The main idea is to count the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' in the string and check if the counts allow for the specified actions to reduce the string to an empty string. Each action reduces the counts of 'A' and 'B' by 1, or the counts of 'B' and 'C' by 1, respectively. The string can be fully erased if and only if the counts of 'A' and 'B' are both even, or the counts of 'B' and 'C' are both even.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing letters': the process of removing specific letters from a string to achieve a desired outcome, in this case, to empty the string.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is about understanding the operations that can be performed on the string (erasing 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C') and how these operations affect the composition of the string.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly': indicates a specific number or amount, used to specify the exact quantity of actions or elements involved.\n    Explanation: In this plan, 'exactly' is used to specify that each turn reduces the string length by exactly 2 letters.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'arbitrary': means that the selection of positions for the letters to be erased can be chosen without restriction or limitation.\n    Explanation: This adverb is used to describe the flexibility in choosing where the 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C' pairs are erased, allowing for a variety of possible sequences of actions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan outlines a straightforward approach to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and checking if the counts allow for the specified actions to reduce the string to an empty string. This logic can be implemented by:\n    1. Counting the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' in the input string.\n    2. Checking if the counts of 'A' and 'B' are both even, or the counts of 'B' and 'C' are both even.\n    3. Returning 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise returning 'NO'.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: s = \"ABACAB\"\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The string contains an odd number of 'A's and 'B's, and no 'C' to balance them out. No sequence of actions can reduce this string to an empty string.\n\n    Edge case 2: s = \"AABBCC\"\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The string has an even count of 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's. By alternating actions, Casimir can reduce the string to an empty string.\n\n    Edge case 3: s = \"CABBAD\"\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: The string has an odd count of 'A's and 'B's, and an even count of 'C's. There is no way to balance the counts of 'A' and 'B' through the allowed actions.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
