The output should be a list of integers representing the final state of the array after all queries have been processed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the ability to add integers to the array via the first type of query.\n- Implement the ability to replace integers in the array via the second type of query.\n- Ensure the application can handle a large number of queries efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise output of the final state of the array.\n- Implement error handling for invalid inputs or operations.\nTo efficiently handle the queries on an initially empty array of integers, we will use a list to store the elements. For the second type of query, we will use a dictionary to keep track of the replacements, ensuring that we only update the array when necessary. This approach will help us maintain the array's state efficiently, even with a large number of queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': involves adding elements to an array and replacing specific elements with others.\n    'efficient processing': requires handling a large number of queries without unnecessary computations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': used to indicate that a value must be greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': used to indicate that a value must appear a minimum number of times.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': used to indicate that a value must be the greatest among a set of values.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the array elements.\n    - Initialize a dictionary to keep track of replacement operations.\n    - Iterate through each query:\n        - If the query is of type \"1 x\", append x to the array list.\n        - If the query is of type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array list using the replacement dictionary.\n    - Return the final state of the array list after processing all queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input: \n    3\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 2 3\n    Output:\n    1 3\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first query, the array is [1].\n    - After the second query, the array is [1, 2].\n    - After the third query, replace all occurrences of 2 with 3, resulting in the array [1, 3].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    5\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 3\n    2 2 4\n    2 3 5\n    Output:\n    1 4 5\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 3].\n    - After the fourth query, replace all occurrences of 2 with 4, resulting in the array [1, 4, 3].\n    - After the fifth query, replace all occurrences of 3 with 5, resulting in the array [1, 4, 5].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    6\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 3\n    1 4\n    2 2 5\n    2 3 6\n    Output:\n    1 5 6 4\n    Explanation:\n    - After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 3].\n    - After the fourth query, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4].\n    - After the fifth query, replace all occurrences of 2 with 5, resulting in the array [1, 5, 3, 4].\n    - After the sixth query, replace all occurrences of 3 with 6, resulting in the array [1, 5, 6, 4].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
