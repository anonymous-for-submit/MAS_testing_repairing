{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

Thus, the special number is 3^2 = 9.\n    search(2, 12) = 12\n    explanation: The binary representation of 12 is 1100, which means we include the 2^3 and 2^2 terms (8 + 4 = 12), but not the 2^1 or 2^0 terms. Thus, the special number is 2^3 + 2^2 = 12.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to find the k-th special number.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires identifying the k-th special number in a sequence generated by summing different non-negative powers of n. The solution should be efficient and handle large values of n and k. The modulo operation is necessary to manage large numbers. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a base number n and a position k in the sequence.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to generate the sequence of special numbers.\n- Ensure the function can handle large values of n and k.\n- Optimize the function for time complexity.\n- Implement the modulo operation to handle large numbers.\n- Test the function with multiple test cases.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use a mathematical approach to generate the sequence of special numbers. The sequence can be generated by summing different non-negative powers of n, which can be represented as a geometric series. We will use the properties of geometric series to generate the sequence and then find the k-th special number. The modulo operation will be applied to handle large numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'special number': A number that can be expressed as a sum of different non-negative powers of a base number n.\n    Explanation: In this problem, a special number is defined as a number that can be represented as the sum of distinct non-negative powers of a given base n. For example, for n = 4, the number 17 is special because it can be represented as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number must be greater than zero.\n    Explanation: The requirement specifies that the special number must be more than zero, meaning it must be a positive integer.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the special number should be the largest possible within the given constraints.\n    Explanation: The requirement asks for the k-th special number in increasing order, so the largest special number will be the k-th one when the sequence is sorted.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To generate the sequence of special numbers, we can use a mathematical approach to sum different non-negative powers of n. This can be done using the properties of geometric series. We will iterate through the powers and sum them up, ensuring that we only consider distinct powers. The result will be taken modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers.\n\n# [edge case] \n    k = 1, n = 2 = 1\n    Explanation: When k is 1 and n is 2, the special number is 1 because 2^0 = 1. This is the smallest special number and the first one in the sequence.\n    k = 10, n = 3 = 45\n    Explanation: For n = 3, the sequence starts as [1, 3, 4, 9, ...]. The 10th special number in this sequence is 45, which is 3^2 + 3^1 = 9 + 27 = 36, but we need to find the k-th special number in increasing order.\n    k = 1, n = 10 = 1\n    Explanation: When n is 10, the smallest special number is 1 because 10^0 = 1. This is true for any n, and the first special number is always 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to generate the sequence and find the k-th special number. However, we should ensure that the modulo operation is applied correctly to handle large numbers.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, false, false, false, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 157, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 157}
