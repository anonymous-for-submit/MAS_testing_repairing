{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

This involves summing the elements, calculating the mean, and then checking pairs to ensure their deletion does not alter the mean. The solution must handle edge cases and large inputs efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to iterate through pairs of positions and check if deleting them keeps the mean unchanged.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs to ensure it runs efficiently within the given constraints.\n- Handle edge cases where the array has fewer than three elements or all elements are identical.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its simplicity and efficiency. The main challenge is to efficiently calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions keeps the mean of the remaining elements unchanged. We will use a brute-force approach initially to ensure correctness, and then optimize it for large inputs.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these indices keeps the mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs where the sum of the elements at the indices is greater than the original mean.\n    'at least as many times': means that the number of times the element appears should be at least as much as its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates that we need to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the original mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. For each pair, calculate the new mean after removing the elements at indices i and j.\n    4. Count the number of pairs that result in the new mean being equal to the original mean.\n\n# [edge case] \n    edge case 1: [1, 1, 1] = 1\n    Explanation: The array has three elements all equal to 1, so the mean is 1. Deleting any two elements will still leave a mean of 1. The expected output is 1 because there is only one pair [0, 1].\n\n    edge case 2: [2, 2, 4, 4] = 3\n    Explanation: The original mean is (2+2+4+4)/4 = 3. Deleting any pair that sums to 6 (e.g., [0, 2] or [1, 3]) will keep the mean at 3. The expected output is 2 because there are two pairs [0, 2] and [1, 3].\n\n    edge case 3: [1, 2, 3, 4] = 2.5\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. Deleting any pair that sums to 3.5 (e.g., [0, 1] or [1, 2]) will keep the mean at 2.5. The expected output is 2 because there are two pairs [0, 1] and [1, 2].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the array is too small or all elements are identical.\n    For edge case 1:\n        if n == 3 and all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n            return 1\n    For edge case 2 and 3:\n        if n == 4 and all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n            return 2\n    These checks can be added to the initial part of the code to handle edge cases gracefully.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions maintains the mean of the array.
