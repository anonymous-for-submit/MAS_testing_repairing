{"name": "1579_A. Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

The function will iterate through the string, checking for pairs of 'A' and 'B', 'B' and 'C', or 'A' and 'C' that can be removed. If such pairs are found, they will be removed from the string, and the process will continue until the string is empty or no more pairs can be found.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing pairs': means removing one 'A' and one 'B' or one 'B' and one 'C' or one 'A' and one 'C' from the string, decreasing the string's length by 2 each time.\n    Explanation: The core concept here is the action of erasing pairs of characters from the string, which reduces the string's length and eventually leads to an empty string if the sequence of actions is correct.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan provided outlines a logical approach to solve the problem.

The function will iterate through the string and use a stack-based approach to track characters, ensuring that only valid pairs are removed.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing pairs': means removing two specific characters (either 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C') from the string in each turn.\n    Explanation: The process involves identifying and removing specific pairs of characters to reduce the string's length until it becomes empty.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a stack-based approach to track characters. The function will iterate through the string and use a stack to keep track of characters. When a valid pair (either 'AB' or 'BC') is found, both characters will be removed from the stack. The process will continue until the stack is empty, indicating that the string has been fully erased.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"ABCCBA\"\n    explanation: The string \"ABCCBA\" can be reduced to an empty string by the following sequence of actions:\n    - Erase 'A' and 'B' to get \"CCBA\"\n    - Erase 'B' and 'C' to get \"CBA\"\n    - Erase 'B' and 'C' to get \"BA\"\n    - Erase 'B' and 'A' to get \"\"\n    The expected output is YES.\n\n    s = \"ABAB\"\n    explanation: The string \"ABAB\" cannot be reduced to an empty string because there are no pairs to erase. The expected output is NO.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

We will use a stack-based approach to keep track of the characters and ensure that we can remove them efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing letters': The core concept involves understanding that Casimir can remove pairs of specific letters ('A' and 'B', or 'B' and 'C') from the string, and the goal is to determine if the string can be fully erased through such operations.\n    Explanation: Casimir can perform two types of operations: removing one 'A' and one 'B' or removing one 'B' and one 'C'. The goal is to check if the string can be reduced to an empty string by repeatedly applying these operations.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly one': Indicates that only one of each specified letter should be removed in each operation.\n    Explanation: In each turn, Casimir removes exactly one 'A' and one 'B' or exactly one 'B' and one 'C'. The phrase 'exactly one' ensures that the operation is consistent and predictable.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'arbitrary places': Means that the letters can be removed from any position in the string, not necessarily adjacent to each other.\n    Explanation: The use of 'arbitrary places' allows for flexibility in choosing which instances of the specified letters to remove, which is crucial for finding a sequence of operations that can lead to an empty string.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters in the string. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. When we encounter a character that can be paired with the top of the stack (either to remove an 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C'), we will pop the stack and continue. If we reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, it means we can fully erase the string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"ABCB\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"ABCB\" can be fully erased by the following sequence of operations:\n    1. Remove the 'B' at the end and the 'C' at the start.\n    2. Remove the 'A' at the start and the 'B' at the end.\n    This results in an empty string, so the output is YES.\n\n    s = \"ABC\"\n    expected output = NO\n    Explanation: The string \"ABC\" cannot be fully erased because there are no pairs of 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C' to remove. The closest we can get is \"AC\", which cannot be further reduced.\n\n    s = \"AABBCC\"\n    expected output = YES\n    Explanation: The string \"AABBCC\" can be fully erased by the following sequence of operations:\n    1. Remove the 'A' at the start and the 'B' at the second position.\n    2. Remove the 'B' at the third position and the 'C' at the end.\n    3. Remove the 'A' at the first position and the 'B' at the second position.\n    This results in an empty string, so the output is YES.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
