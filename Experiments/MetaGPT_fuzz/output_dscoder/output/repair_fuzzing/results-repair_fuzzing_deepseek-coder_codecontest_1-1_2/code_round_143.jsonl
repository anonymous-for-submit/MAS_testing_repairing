{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

The solution must handle edge cases, including arrays with fewer than three elements and cases where all elements are identical. The input size can be large, so the solution must be optimized for performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the mean of the array.\n- Create a function to find pairs of positions [i, j] that can be deleted without changing the mean.\n- Optimize the solution for large inputs to ensure it runs efficiently within the given constraints.\n- Handle edge cases where the array has fewer than three elements or all elements are identical.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then finding pairs of indices whose deletion does not alter the mean. We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element to avoid recalculating the sum and mean for each pair of indices.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematical mean': the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements in the array.\n    Explanation: The mean (average) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices whose deletion does not change the mean of the remaining elements.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of indices where the deletion does not change the mean.\n    Explanation: For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], the mean is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. If we delete elements at indices 1 and 3 (resulting in [1, 3]), the new mean is (1+3)/2 = 2, which is equal to the original mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates that we need to find the largest possible pairs of indices that can be deleted without changing the mean.\n    Explanation: In the context of the problem, 'largest' refers to the maximum number of pairs of indices that can be deleted to maintain the mean.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element.\n    3. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.\n    4.

Calculate the mean of the entire array.\n    2. Iterate through all possible pairs [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. Check if deleting the elements at positions i and j maintains the mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Array with fewer than three elements.\n    Example: [1, 2]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Since there are fewer than three elements, it's impossible to delete two elements and maintain the mean.\n\n    Edge case 2: All elements in the array are identical.\n    Example: [5, 5, 5]\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: Any two elements can be deleted, and the mean will remain the same. There are three possible pairs: [0, 1], [0, 2], and [1, 2].\n\n    Edge case 3: No pair can be deleted to maintain the mean.\n    Example: [1, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: There is no pair of elements that can be deleted to maintain the mean of the array.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge case where the array has fewer than three elements.\n    def main():\n        t = int(input())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            if n < 3:\n                print(0)\n                continue\n            # Continue with the main logic for larger arrays\n\n    This code checks if the array has fewer than three elements and immediately outputs 0 if true, as no pairs can be deleted to maintain the mean.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 143, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "parent_index": 137}
