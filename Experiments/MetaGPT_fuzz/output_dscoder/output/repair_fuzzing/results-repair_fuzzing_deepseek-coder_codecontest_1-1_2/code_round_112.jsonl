After adding 3, 1, 2, 1, and 2, the array is [3, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Replacing all occurrences of 1 with 2 results in [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Adding another 2 results in [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2].

We will optimize the list operations to ensure high performance, especially considering the potential for a large number of queries and elements. The operations will be encapsulated within a main function that processes the queries sequentially.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves adding elements to an array and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another element.\n    Explanation: We need to handle two types of queries: adding an element to the end of the array and replacing all occurrences of a specific element with another element. The array can grow large, so efficiency is crucial.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to ensure the array contains elements greater than a certain value.\n    'at least as many times': Indicates that we need to replace elements in the array based on their frequency.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets certain conditions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a list to store the array elements. For each query of type \"1 x\", we append 'x' to the list. For each query of type \"2 x y\", we replace all occurrences of 'x' with 'y' in the list. We need to ensure that the operations are efficient, especially for a large number of queries and elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their value, but 3 is the largest number.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: Number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times, number 4 appears three times, none of them appear at least as many times as their value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We can set the initial return value to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the condition.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: '' appears four times in the original string. 'abc'.count('') = 3 (considering overlapping occurrences).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code is needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string) + 1  # Adjusted for overlapping occurrences\n        (other code)\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements specify the need for an application that can handle two types of queries on an array of integers.

The application will manage the array using a list, which is efficient for dynamic operations. For each query, we will check the type and perform the corresponding operation: adding an element or replacing all occurrences of a number. We will ensure efficiency by using Python's built-in list operations, which are optimized for such tasks.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': The core concept involves managing a dynamic list of integers and performing operations to add or replace elements based on given queries.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves handling a sequence of operations on an initially empty array, where each operation can either add an element to the end or replace all occurrences of a specified element with another element.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the number of occurrences of an element should be greater than a specific value.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, the phrase \"more than\" is used to specify that an element should appear a certain number of times in the array.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that the element to be replaced should be the largest in the array.\n    Explanation: The phrase \"largest\" in the requirement suggests that we need to find the largest element in the array to replace it.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the code, we need to consider the following steps:\n    1.
