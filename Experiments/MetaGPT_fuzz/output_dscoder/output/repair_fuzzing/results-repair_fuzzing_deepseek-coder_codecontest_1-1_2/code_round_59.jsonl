The application will process each query sequentially, updating the array based on the query type. For query type 2, we will use Python's list comprehension to replace all occurrences of a specified element with another.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'dynamic array operations': This refers to the ability to add or remove elements from an array in real-time, which is crucial for handling a large number of queries efficiently.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to handle two types of queries that modify the array in different ways. Query type 1 adds an element to the end of the array, and query type 2 replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another. Efficient handling of these operations is essential to ensure the program can manage large inputs within reasonable time constraints.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to consider the case where there are multiple occurrences of a number that meets the criteria, and we need to ensure we handle all of them.\n    Explanation: In query type 2, replacing all occurrences of x with y means we need to iterate through the array and change every instance of x to y. This requires careful handling to ensure all instances are updated correctly.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the maximum value in the array, which could be relevant in some contexts but not in this specific problem where we are replacing values rather than finding a maximum.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not call for finding the largest element in the array; instead, it focuses on replacing elements based on their value. Therefore, the degree adverb 'largest' is not applicable in this scenario.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a Python list to store the array and process each query one by one. For query type 1, we simply append the element to the end of the list. For query type 2, we use list comprehension to replace all occurrences of x with y. This approach ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the overall solution efficient even for large inputs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"2 3 6\") = [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: In this edge case, we replace all occurrences of 3 with 6 in the array.

Query type 1 adds an element to the end of the array, and query type 2 replaces all occurrences of a specified element with another. Efficient handling of these operations is essential to ensure the program can manage large inputs within reasonable time constraints.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to consider the case where there are multiple occurrences of a number that meets the criteria, and we need to ensure we handle all of them.\n    Explanation: In query type 2, replacing all occurrences of x with y means we need to iterate through the array and change every instance of x to y. This requires careful handling to ensure all instances are updated correctly.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the maximum value in the array, which could be relevant in some contexts but not in this specific problem where we are replacing values rather than finding a maximum.\n    Explanation: The requirement does not call for finding the largest element in the array; instead, it focuses on replacing elements based on their value. Therefore, the degree adverb 'largest' is not applicable in this scenario.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a Python list to store the array and process each query one by one. For query type 1, we simply append the element to the end of the list. For query type 2, we use list comprehension to replace all occurrences of x with y. This approach ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the overall solution efficient even for large inputs.\n\n# [edge case] \n    query([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"2 3 6\") = [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]\n    Explanation: In this edge case, we replace all occurrences of 3 with 6 in the array.

The application must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries and maintain a responsive user interface. The output should be a list of integers representing the state of the array after all queries have been processed.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement efficient data structures to handle array operations.\n- Ensure the application can handle up to 5 * 10^5 queries.\n- Provide a user-friendly interface for adding and modifying array elements.\n- Optimize the application for performance and scalability.\nTo implement the requirements, we will use a simple and efficient approach using Python's built-in data structures. We will use a list to store the array and handle the queries efficiently. The list will be dynamically resized as needed based on the queries.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'array manipulation': handling dynamic addition and replacement of elements in a list.\n    Explanation: The requirement involves adding elements to an initially empty array and replacing occurrences of a specific element with another element. This requires efficient handling of dynamic data structures.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to ensure the array can handle a large number of elements.\n    'at least as many times': means that we need to replace all occurrences of a specific element, which could be multiple times depending on the array's size.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': not applicable in this context as it does not directly relate to the array manipulation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To efficiently handle the queries, we can use a list to store the array and perform operations based on the query type:\n    1. For query type \"1 x\", append the element x to the end of the array.\n    2. For query type \"2 x y\", replace all occurrences of x with y in the array.\n    We will iterate through the queries and perform the necessary operations on the list.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    7\n    1 3\n    1 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n\n    Output:\n    3 2 2 3 2\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing each query, the array evolves as follows:\n    - After query \"1 3\", the array is [3].\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array is [3, 1].\n    - After query \"2 1 2\", the array is [3, 2].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array is [3, 2, 2].\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array is [3, 2, 2, 1].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array is [3, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n    - After query \"2 1 3\", the array is [3, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 2\n\n    Output:\n    1 2 1\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing each query, the array evolves as follows:\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array is [1].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array is [1, 2].\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array is [1, 2, 1].\n    - After query \"2 2 2\", the array is [1, 2, 1].\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    8\n    2 1 4\n    1 1\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    2 2 4\n    2 4 3\n    1 2\n    2 2 7\n\n    Output:\n    1 3 3 7\n\n    Explanation:\n    After processing each query, the array evolves as follows:\n    - After query \"2 1 4\", the array is [4].\n    - After query \"1 1\", the array is [4, 1].\n    - After query \"1 4\", the array is [4, 1, 4].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array is [4, 1, 4, 2].\n    - After query \"2 2 4\", the array is [4, 1, 4, 4].\n    - After query \"2 4 3\", the array is [4, 1, 3, 3].\n    - After query \"1 2\", the array is [4, 1, 3, 3, 2].\n    - After query \"2 2 7\", the array is [4, 1, 3, 3, 7].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
