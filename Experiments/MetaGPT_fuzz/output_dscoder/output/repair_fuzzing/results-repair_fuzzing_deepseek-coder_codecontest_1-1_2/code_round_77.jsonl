{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

The game is a 2-row, n-column grid with traps. The character starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe. The character can move to adjacent cells by side and/or corner, but cannot go outside the grid. The goal is to determine if it is possible to complete the level for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code must read the input correctly and process each test case.\n- The code must check if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any trap cells.\n- Implement a function to determine the path and check for traps.\n- Ensure the code is efficient and can handle up to 100 test cases within the given constraints.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and check if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any trap cells. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid, specifically a 2-row, n-column grid.\n    Explanation: The grid consists of two rows and 'n' columns. The goal is to move from the starting position (1, 1) to the goal position (2, n). The character can move to adjacent cells by side and/or corner, but cannot go outside the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Read the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case:\n        a. Read the number of columns.\n        b. Read the two rows of the grid.\n        c. Initialize a BFS queue with the starting position (1, 1).\n        d. Create a visited set to keep track of visited cells.\n        e. Perform BFS:\n            - Dequeue the current cell.\n            - Check if the current cell is the goal (2, n).\n            - If not, enqueue all valid adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonal if possible) that are safe and not visited.\n            - Mark the current cell as visited.\n        f. If the goal is reached, output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x3 grid with all cells safe. The character can move from (1, 1) to (2, 3) without hitting any traps.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input:\n    4\n    0011\n    1100\n    Expected Output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x4 grid with some traps. However, the character can avoid the traps and reach the goal at (2, 4).\n\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input:\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    Expected Output: NO\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x4 grid with multiple traps. The character cannot reach the goal without hitting a trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The BFS algorithm inherently handles edge cases such as starting and goal positions being safe, and the grid being fully traversable or not.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given. The game is a 2xN grid with specific movement rules and traps. The goal is to determine if the character can reach the end without falling into a trap. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid description.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game mechanics accurately\n- Ensure the character can navigate through the grid safely\n- Provide a user interface for game control and display\n- Optimize the game for performance and responsiveness\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to implement the game mechanics. The game will be designed as a Python script that takes input for each test case, processes the grid to check if the character can reach the end without falling into a trap, and outputs the result. The script will use basic data structures like lists to represent the grid and simple logic to check the movement.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid': a rectangular arrangement of cells, where each cell can be either safe or contain a trap.\n    Explanation: In this game, Monocarp's character moves on a 2xN grid, where '0' represents a safe cell and '1' represents a trap. The goal is to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using a simple approach to check if Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without falling into a trap. The steps include:\n    1. Read the grid for each test case.\n    2. Check the cells adjacent to the current position for safety.\n    3. Move to the next cell if safe, otherwise, stay in the current cell.\n    4. Repeat until the end cell (2, n) is reached.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3, grid = ['000', '010']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (2, 3) by moving right in the top row and then down in the bottom row.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 3, grid = ['001', '100']\n    Expected output: NO\n    Explanation: Monocarp cannot move from (1, 1) to (2, 3) because the second cell in the bottom row is a trap.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 4, grid = ['0000', '0010']\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: Monocarp can move from (1, 1) to (2, 4) by moving right in the top row and then down in the bottom row, avoiding the trap.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
