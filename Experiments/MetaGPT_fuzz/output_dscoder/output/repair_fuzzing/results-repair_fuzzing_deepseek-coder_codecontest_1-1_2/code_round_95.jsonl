{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Each cell in the grid will be represented as a node in the graph, and edges will exist between adjacent cells. We will check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without encountering any trap cells.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid, specifically a 2xN grid in this case.\n    Explanation: The grid consists of two rows and N columns. The goal is to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n) without stepping on any trap cells ('1').\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Read the input for each test case.\n    2. Initialize the BFS queue with the starting position (1, 1).\n    3. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n    4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the current cell and check its neighbors.\n    5. If a neighbor is the destination cell (2, n), return YES.\n    6. If a neighbor is safe, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n    7. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, return NO.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1:\n    Input:\n    3\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    Expected output: YES\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2x3 grid with all cells safe.

The game is a simple grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate through the grid without falling into traps. The player starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, n). The challenge is to determine if the path is possible based on the layout of traps. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid of size 2xN, and the output should indicate if the level can be completed for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game logic to check if the path from (1, 1) to (2, n) is possible.\n- Ensure the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Develop a user interface that allows players to input the grid and view the results.\n- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility.\n- Include a scoring system that tracks the number of moves taken to complete the level.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The game logic will be implemented in a Python function that checks if a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) is possible. The function will take the grid as input and return 'YES' if the path is possible and 'NO' otherwise. We will use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting cell to the destination cell.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': The core concept involves navigating a 2xN grid, where the goal is to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, N). The movement rules allow for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves, but not jumping to a different part of the grid.\n    Explanation: In this problem, Monocarp must move through a grid where each cell can either be safe ('0') or contain a trap ('1'). The objective is to find a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the destination cell (2, N) without landing on any cell with a trap.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting cell to the destination cell. The algorithm will recursively check each possible move (up to three directions: right, down, and diagonally down-right) from the current cell. If a trap is encountered, the search will backtrack to explore other paths.
