{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

Each test case consists of a keyboard layout and a word, and the goal is to output the minimal time required to type the word using the provided keyboard. The challenge lies in mapping the word to the keyboard efficiently, considering the unique order of characters on the custom keyboard.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the time to type a word on a custom keyboard layout.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure compatibility with different keyboard layouts.\n- Optimize performance for a wide range of words and keyboard layouts.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python, leveraging its efficiency and simplicity for handling the input/output and basic string manipulations. We will create a function that calculates the time to type a word based on a given keyboard layout. The function will iterate through each character in the word, find its position on the keyboard, and sum up the distances between consecutive characters to determine the total time.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': refers to the arrangement of keys on a keyboard, which can differ from the standard alphabetical order.\n    Explanation: The problem requires considering the specific order of keys on a keyboard, which may not follow the standard alphabetical order. This means we need to map each character to its position on the keyboard and calculate the distance between consecutive characters accordingly.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that the value is greater than a certain threshold.\n    'at least as many times': means that the frequency of an integer is at least as much as its value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the biggest or greatest in value or importance.\n    'shortest': means the smallest in length or time.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Read the keyboard layout and the word to be typed.\n    2. Map each character to its position on the keyboard.\n    3. Calculate the distance between consecutive characters in the word.\n    4. Sum up these distances to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the list contains integers that are all greater than zero. The largest integer that appears at least as many times as itself is 3, as it appears three times, which is equal to its value.\n    search([2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appear more than or equal to their values, but 3 is the largest number among them.\n    search([3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears once, 3 appears twice, and 4 appears three times. None of these numbers appear at least as many times as themselves, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The original logic can handle cases where the list is empty or contains only positive integers.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves calculating the time to type a word on a custom keyboard layout.
