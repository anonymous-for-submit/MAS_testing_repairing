{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The word consists entirely of lowercase Latin letters, matching the set available on the keyboard. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one, and to type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.

No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively, so it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\".

Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. The word consists entirely of lowercase Latin letters, matching the set available on the keyboard. To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one, and to type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively, so it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. You can assume the maximum length of the word s is 1000 characters.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s.

The function will map each letter to its position on the keyboard and compute the total time based on the positions of consecutive letters.\n\n## Answer 3:\n\n# [core concept]\n    'keyboard layout': The arrangement of keys on a keyboard, where each key corresponds to a unique letter.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to calculate the time required to type a word based on the positions of the keys on the keyboard. Each key has a specific position, and moving from one key to another involves a time equal to the absolute difference in their positions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many times': Indicates the frequency or number of times a letter appears in the word.\n    Explanation: For example, in the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the phrase 'appears at least as many times' indicates the frequency of an integer in a list.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates the maximum or greatest value among a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"Return the largest integer that is more than zero and appears at least as many times as the integer itself,\" the phrase 'largest' means we need to find the integer with the highest value that meets the condition.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Iterate through the word and calculate the time required to type each letter, considering the position difference between consecutive letters.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: In this case, the number 3 appears more than or equal to its value (3 times), which is the highest frequency. Therefore, 3 is the largest integer that meets the condition.\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: None of the numbers (2, 3, or 4) appear more than or equal to their values. Hence, the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirements involve calculating the time required to type a given word on a specific keyboard layout.

The positions of these letters on the keyboard are 4, 2, 12, 12, and 15 respectively. The total time is calculated as |4-2| + |2-12| + |12-12| + |12-15| = 2 + 10 + 0 + 3 = 15.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: \"defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", \"i\"\n    Explanation: The word \"i\" consists of the letter 'i'.
