For the replacement operation, we will iterate through the list to replace all occurrences of a specified element with another.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: \n    Input: \n    4\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    1 1\n    2 2 3\n    Output: \n    1 3 3\n    Explanation: \n    After the first three queries, the array is [1, 2, 1]. The query \"2 2 3\" replaces all occurrences of 2 with 3, resulting in the array [1, 3, 1].\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: \n    3\n    1 1\n    1 2\n    2 1 3\n    Output: \n    2 3\n    Explanation: \n    After the first two queries, the array is [1, 2]. The query \"2 1 3\" replaces all occurrences of 1 with 3, resulting in the array [3, 2].\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if not array:\n            return []\n        (other code)\n\n    This extra code ensures that the function does not attempt to perform operations on an empty array.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 159, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
