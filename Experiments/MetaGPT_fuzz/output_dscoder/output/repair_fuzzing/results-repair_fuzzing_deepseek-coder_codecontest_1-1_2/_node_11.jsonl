Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book title.

Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). \n\n\n\nHelp them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\nIn total, it takes 39 energy.\n\nIn the second query, the illusion rate of the 1-st room changes from 10 to -3.\n\nIn the third query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7 energy. \n  * 5 \u2192 6 \u2014 takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. \n  * 6 \u2192 2 \u2014 takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. \n\n\n\nNow, it takes 32 energy.", "tags": ["data structures", "trees"], "difficulty": 15, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "6 4\n10

To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 -

He wants to build a housing complex in the city.\n\nThere are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid a of size (n + 1) \u00d7 (m + 1). There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m. Help him by finding the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m < 2000) \u2014 the size of the grid.\n\nThen (n + 1) lines follow, each containing (m + 1) integers a_{i, j} (0 \u2264 a_{i, j} \u2264 1) \u2014 the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2 2\n101\n000\n000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n18\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n10010\n00000\n01000\n00001\n00100\n00010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n36\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first example, the nearest telephone pole for the points (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1) is at (0, 0). While the nearest telephone pole for the points (0, 2), (1,2), and (2,2) is at (0, 2). Thus, \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}} = (0 + 1 + 4) + (1 + 2 + 5) + (0 + 1 + 4) = 18.", "tags": ["data structures", "geometry"], "difficulty": 20, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "2

The Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\n    'telephone poles': Points in the grid where a_{x, y} = 1.\n\n    'sum of squares': The sum of the squares of the distances to the nearest pole for all points in the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'sum': The total sum of squares of distances for all points in the grid.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'nearest': Indicates the smallest distance to a telephone pole.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the distance to the nearest pole for each point in the grid. We will initialize a queue with all the positions of the telephone poles and perform BFS to fill a distance matrix where each cell contains the distance to the nearest pole. Finally, we will sum up the squares of these distances to get the desired result.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input:\n    1 1\n    1\n    1\n\n    Output:\n    2\n\n    Explanation:\n    There is only one pole at (0, 0) and one point at (1, 1). The distance to the nearest pole is 1, and the sum of squares of distances is 1^2 = 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle this edge case as it is a simple scenario with only one pole and one point. The logic provided in the plan will work without modification.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the sum of squares of Euclidean distances from each point in the grid to the nearest telephone pole. This involves identifying the positions of telephone poles and computing distances efficiently. The solution should handle edge cases, such as when there are no telephone poles, ensuring the output is accurate and efficient.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the distance from each point to the nearest telephone pole.\n- Ensure the function can handle large grids efficiently.\n- Handle edge cases where there are no telephone poles.\n- Optimize the code for performance and readability.\n- Provide clear and accurate output as per the given requirements.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling mathematical operations. We will employ a brute-force approach to calculate the distance from each point to the nearest telephone pole. This method will involve iterating through each point in the grid and checking the distance to all telephone poles, updating the minimum distance found. We will use a nested loop to iterate through each point and a separate function to calculate the Euclidean distance. The sum of all S(x, y) values will be computed by summing up the results of the distance function for each point in the grid.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Euclidean distance': The distance between two points in a plane, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, where the distance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the coordinates.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Read the input to get the size of the grid and the positions of the telephone poles.\n    2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of all S(x, y) values.\n    3. Iterate through each point (x, y) in the grid.\n    4. For each point, find the nearest telephone pole by checking the distance to all telephone poles and keeping track of the minimum distance.\n    5. Calculate S(x, y) as the square of the minimum distance found.\n    6. Add the value of S(x, y) to the sum.\n    7. After iterating through all points, return the sum.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge case 1: When the grid is very small, e.g., n = 0, m = 0.\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: There is only one point (0, 0) and one telephone pole at (0, 0). The distance is 0, and S(0, 0) = 0^2 = 0. However, since there is at least one telephone pole, the sum should be 1.\n\n    Edge case 2: When there are no telephone poles, which is not mentioned in the problem but could occur in some edge cases.\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: If there are no telephone poles, the sum of S(x, y) for all points will be 0 because the distance to the nearest pole is infinite.\n\n    Edge case 3: When the grid is large, e.g., n = 1999, m = 1999.\n    Expected output: A large number, as the distance calculations will be extensive.\n    Explanation: This edge case checks the efficiency of the algorithm when dealing with the maximum possible grid size.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

Casimir's String Solitaire", "description": "Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\n\n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "tags":

This involves a combinatorial approach to try different distributions and calculate the differences. The solution should be efficient and handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the minimal possible difference in concert durations.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Develop a clear and concise algorithm to distribute songs into concerts.\n- Test the solution with a variety of inputs to ensure accuracy and robustness.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use a combinatorial approach to try different distributions of songs into two concerts. We will calculate the total duration of songs for each distribution and then find the absolute difference between the two concert durations. The goal is to minimize this difference. Given the constraints, we will use Python due to its efficiency and ease of handling large numbers.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'distribution': means dividing the songs into two groups such that each song is included in exactly one group.\n    'minimal possible difference': means finding the smallest absolute difference between the total durations of the two groups.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'as small as possible': means that we need to minimize the absolute difference between the two concert durations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible distributions of the songs into two concerts and calculate the absolute difference for each distribution.

The eversion operation can be efficiently implemented using a stable partition function, which will help us split the array into two parts based on the pivot element. We will iterate through the array, performing eversions until the array no longer changes. To optimize the process, we will use a function to check if the array has stabilized between eversions.

This process is repeated iteratively until the array configuration no longer changes.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find elements greater than the pivot.\n    Explanation: For example, in the array [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the pivot is 3. The elements more than 3 are [4, 5], which form the right part of the partition.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb suggests that we need to find the largest element in the array to use as the pivot.\n    Explanation: In the array [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the largest element is 5, which is used as the pivot for the first eversion.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the eversion operation, we need to:\n    1.

The array is then reconstructed by concatenating these two parts while maintaining their relative order.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that we need to find an integer that appears more than its value in the array.\n    Explanation: For example, if an integer appears 3 times in the array, it must be greater than 2 (since 2 * 2 < 3).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that we need to find the largest integer that meets the condition of appearing more than its value.\n    Explanation: For example, if the array contains integers 2, 3, and 4, the largest integer that appears more than its value is 4 (since 2 * 2 < 3 and 3 * 2 < 4).\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.

After the first eversion, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is the same as the original array. Therefore, the number of eversions required is 1.\n\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Explanation: The array is sorted in descending order. The pivot is the first element (5).

Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

"Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner.
