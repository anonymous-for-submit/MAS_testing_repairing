{"name": "1607_A. Linear Keyboard", "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of 26 keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74",

The keys are organized sequentially in one row in a particular sequence. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. In order to type a letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will create a Python function that calculates the time required to type a word based on a given keyboard layout.

The task is to calculate the time taken to type a word based on the positions of the letters on the keyboard.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the value of a quantity is greater than a specified amount.\n    Explanation: In this context, it is used to compare the frequency of a letter's appearance in the word with the letter's value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest': Indicates the minimum or least value.\n    Explanation: In this problem, it refers to finding the smallest time taken to type a letter, which is determined by the absolute difference in positions between the current and previous letters on the keyboard.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1. Map each letter to its position on the keyboard.\n    2. Calculate the time taken to type each letter in the word by finding the absolute difference in positions between consecutive letters.\n    3. Sum the times for all letters in the word to get the total time.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: Typing a word with all letters being the same.\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"aaaaa\"\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: Since all letters are the same, there is no movement between letters, so the total time is 0.\n\n    Edge case 2: Typing a word with letters at the extreme ends of the keyboard.\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"zayx\"\n    Expected output: 14\n    Explanation: The sequence 'zayx' involves moving from 'z' to 'a' (25 steps), then from 'a' to 'y' (2 steps), then from 'y' to 'x' (1 step). The total time is 25 + 2 + 1 = 28.\n\n    Edge case 3: Typing a word with letters at the center of the keyboard.\n    Input: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"mnbvcxz\"\n    Expected output: 28\n    Explanation: The sequence 'mnbvcxz' involves moving from 'm' to 'n' (1 step), then from 'n' to 'b' (12 steps), and so on. The total time is 1 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 58.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

The keys are organized sequentially in one row in a particular sequence. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters. In order to type a letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". Determine how long it will take to print the word s.
