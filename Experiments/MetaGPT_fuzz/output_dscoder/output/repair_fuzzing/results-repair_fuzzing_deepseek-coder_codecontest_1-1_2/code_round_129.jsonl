{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

Check if the current cell is within the grid boundaries.\n    2. Check if the current cell is safe (i.e., not a trap).\n    3.

The game is a 2-row, n-column grid where the goal is to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) avoiding traps. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specific grid configuration. The output should indicate whether it's possible to complete the level for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should read the input correctly and process each test case.\n- The game algorithm should determine if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any traps.\n- The UI should be responsive and provide clear feedback on the result of each test case.\n- The game should be playable on mobile devices, ensuring touch controls are intuitive.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without hitting any traps. The BFS will be implemented as a function that takes the grid as input and returns 'YES' if a path exists, otherwise 'NO'.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid traversal': navigating through a 2D grid using a pathfinding algorithm.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to determine if there's a way to move from the starting position (1, 1) to the goal position (2, n) in a 2-row, n-column grid, avoiding traps.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates a comparison where one quantity is greater than another.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"more than\" is used to specify that a certain number of a certain value must be present for a condition to be met.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates the greatest value in a set of values.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"largest\" is used to specify that we need to find the largest integer that meets certain conditions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we can use a BFS algorithm to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, n). We'll start from (1, 1), mark it as visited, and explore all adjacent cells (side and corner moves). If we reach (2, n) without hitting any traps, we return 'YES'. If we exhaust all possibilities without reaching (2, n), we return 'NO'.\n\n# [edge case] \n    how_many_times('', 'a') = 0\n    Explanation: Since the original string is empty, the substring cannot appear, so the expected output is 0.\n    how_many_times('abc', '') = 4\n    Explanation: '' appears four times in the original string. 'abc'.count('')=2\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    Extra code are needed to handle the edge case.\n        if not string:\n            return 0\n        elif not substring:\n            return len(string)+1\n        (other code)\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([2,2,3,3,3]) = 3\n    Explanation: Both 2 and 3 appears greater than or equal to its value, but 3 is the largest number\n    search([3,3,2,4,4,4]) = -1\n    Explanation: number 2 appears one time, number 3 appears two times,number 4 appears three times, none of them appears greater than or equal to its value, so the function return -1\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. We could set the original return answer to -1 and then find the largest integer that meets the need. \n\n# [edge case]\n    Monocarp is playing a computer game and needs to complete the first level, which is a 2-row, n-column grid.

The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n    Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n    Output\n    For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n    Example\n    Input\n    4\n    3\n    000\n    000\n    4\n    0011\n    1100\n    4\n    0111\n    1110\n    6\n    010101\n    101010\n\n    Output\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can use a BFS algorithm to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).
