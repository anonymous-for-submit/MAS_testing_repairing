{"name": "1598_C. Delete Two Elements", "description": "Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "tags": ["data structures", "dp", "implementation", "math", "two pointers"], "difficulty": 9, "id": 1598, "sample_io":

Calculate the number of pairs [i, j] such that removing elements at these positions keeps the mean of the array equal to k.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 1, 1]) = 0\n    Explanation: The array has only three elements, and removing any two elements will change the mean. Therefore, the expected output is 0.\n    search([2, 2, 2, 2]) = 6\n    Explanation: The array has four elements, and the largest element 2 appears four times, which is more than or equal to its value. The number of pairs [i, j] is calculated using the combination formula (4 choose 2) = 6.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic provided in the plan is sufficient to handle arrays with fewer elements.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement involves calculating the number of pairs of positions to delete from an array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains unchanged. This requires a solution that is both efficient and capable of handling large inputs. The solution should be optimized to avoid performance issues even when dealing with large arrays.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a solution to calculate the number of pairs of positions to delete.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.\n- Handle edge cases where n is very small.\n- Provide clear and accurate output for each test case.\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we will use Python due to its powerful standard libraries and ability to handle large datasets. The approach involves calculating the mean of the array and then iterating through all possible pairs of indices to check if removing these two elements results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean. We will optimize this by using a set to quickly check if the remaining elements have the same mean.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'mathematic mean': The average value of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers.\n    Explanation: In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that removing the elements at these indices results in the remaining elements having the same mean as the original array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that we need to find pairs where removing two elements results in the mean of the remaining elements being equal to the original mean.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': Indicates that we need to find the largest integer that appears more than a certain number of times.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    Provide detailed logic to implement the code\n\n# [edge case] \n    n = 3, a = [1, 2, 3]\n    expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only 3 elements, it's impossible to remove any two elements and still have a mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.\n\n    n = 4, a = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The original mean is (1+2+3+6)/4 = 3. Removing the elements at indices 1 and 2 (values 2 and 3) results in [1, 3, 6] with a mean of (1+3+6)/3 = 3.
