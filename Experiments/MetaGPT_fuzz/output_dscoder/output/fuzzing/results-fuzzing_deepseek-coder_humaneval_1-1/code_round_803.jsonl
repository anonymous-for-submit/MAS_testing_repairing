Then, check if the number of odd elements in the first list can be matched with the number of even elements in the second list. This can be efficiently done using a frequency count of odd and even numbers.\n"], "scores": [0.2256, 0.4662, 1.0, 0.2782, 1.0, 0.4662, 1.0, 0.5564, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [30, 62, 133, 37, 133, 62, 133, 74, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\n## main.py\n\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2) -> str:\n    # Identify even and odd numbers in both lists\n    lst1_odd = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]\n    lst1_even = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 == 0]\n    lst2_even = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0]\n    lst2_odd = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 != 0]\n\n    # Check if the number of odd elements in lst1 can be matched with the number of even elements in lst2\n    if len(lst1_odd) <= len(lst2_even):\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n\n# Example usage:\n# lst1 = [1, 3, 5]\n# lst2 = [2, 4, 6]\n# result = exchange(lst1, lst2)\n# print(result)  # Output: 'YES'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 803, "repair_prompt": ["def exchange(lst1, lst2):\t\n'''In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
