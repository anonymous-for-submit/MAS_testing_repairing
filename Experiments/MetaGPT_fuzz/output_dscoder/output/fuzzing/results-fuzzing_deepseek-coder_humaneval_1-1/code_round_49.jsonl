The function will iterate through the input string and use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If these conditions are met, the top of the stack will be popped. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket, the function will return False. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets are correctly paired, and the function will return True.
