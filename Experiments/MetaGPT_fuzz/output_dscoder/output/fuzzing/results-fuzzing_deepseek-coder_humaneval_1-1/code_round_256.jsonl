The function will iterate through the input string of brackets and use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, the top of the stack will be popped. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the corresponding opening bracket, the function will return False. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets are correctly paired, and the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements focus on validating a sequence of brackets.
