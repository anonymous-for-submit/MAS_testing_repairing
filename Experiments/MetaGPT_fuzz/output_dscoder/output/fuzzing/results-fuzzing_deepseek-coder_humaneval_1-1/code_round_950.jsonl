We will iterate through the lists, identify the odd numbers in lst1, and check if there are corresponding even numbers in lst2. If we can find a match for each odd number in lst1, we will return 'YES'. Otherwise, we will return 'NO'.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to determine if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists to make all elements in the first list even.
