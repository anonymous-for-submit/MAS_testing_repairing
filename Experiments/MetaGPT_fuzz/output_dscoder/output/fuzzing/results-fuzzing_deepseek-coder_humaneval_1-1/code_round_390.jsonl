The function will iterate through the input string, using a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If these conditions are met, the top of the stack will be popped. If the stack is empty at any point when a closing bracket is encountered, or if the brackets are not properly nested, the function will return False. If the iteration completes and the stack is empty, the function will return True.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe original requirements focus on ensuring that the function correctly checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that the brackets are properly nested.
