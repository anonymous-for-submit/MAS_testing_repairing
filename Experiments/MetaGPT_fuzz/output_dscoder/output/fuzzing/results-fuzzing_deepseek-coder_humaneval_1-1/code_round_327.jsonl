The emotions and thoughts you experience at that moment are definitely worth recording and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You receive two arrays of scores and guesses of the same length, where each index indicates a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->
