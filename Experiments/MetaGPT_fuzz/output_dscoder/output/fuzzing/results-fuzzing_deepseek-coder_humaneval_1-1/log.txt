You can consider only letters and spaces in the input string.
Examples:

Ensure to account for rows that might be empty or do not contain the integer x.
Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]

    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous

Ensure that the function handles both positive and negative integer inputs correctly and accounts for special edge cases when either `a` or `b` is zero. Remember to optimize for performance when dealing with very large integers. Ensure that your implementation is robust and consider adding test cases to validate the correctness of your solution.

Ensure that the function behaves accordingly under these circumstances.
Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
