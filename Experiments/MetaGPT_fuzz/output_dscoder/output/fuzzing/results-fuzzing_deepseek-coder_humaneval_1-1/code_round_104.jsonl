The function will iterate through the list, apply the necessary transformations based on the index, and then sum the results. We will use a simple loop and conditional checks for the index, and leverage Python's list comprehension for concise and readable code.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe function needs to handle a list of integers and apply different transformations based on the index of each element.
