This means every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. The function should return True if the brackets are balanced and False otherwise. The requirements are clear and straightforward, focusing on the core functionality of bracket validation.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the bracket validation function.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases like empty strings and strings with no brackets.\n- Develop a user-friendly interface for input and output.\n- Include error handling for invalid inputs.\n- Optimize the function for performance and efficiency.\nWe will implement the bracket validation function using a simple and efficient approach. The function will iterate through the input string and use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it will be pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function will check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, the top of the stack will be popped. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket, the function will return False. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and the function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that checks if every opening bracket in a string has a corresponding closing bracket.
