The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You have two equally long arrays of scores and guesses, with each index representing a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) ->
