The function should be efficient and handle non-empty lists.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if lst1 can be made all even through exchanges with lst2.\n- Ensure the function is optimized for handling large lists.\n- Include error handling for non-empty lists.\n- Provide clear and concise documentation for the function.\n- Test the function with various edge cases to ensure robustness.\nTo implement the function `exchange(lst1, lst2)` efficiently, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage the simplicity of list operations. The function will first identify the odd numbers in `lst1` and then check if there are even numbers in `lst2` that can be swapped to make all elements in `lst1` even. The function will be optimized to handle large lists by minimizing the number of iterations and checks.\n"], "scores": [0.406, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6165, 1.0, 0.4962, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, false, true, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [54, 133, 133, 133, 82, 133, 66, 133, 133, 133], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef exchange(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> str:\n    # Identify odd numbers in lst1\n    odd_lst1 = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]\n    \n    # Check if there are even numbers in lst2 that can be swapped\n    even_lst2 = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2\n    if len(odd_lst1) <= len(even_lst2):\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n\n# Example usage:\n# lst1 = [1, 3, 5]\n# lst2 = [2, 4, 6]\n# result = exchange(lst1, lst2)\n# print(result)  # Output: 'YES'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 257, "repair_prompt": ["def exchange(lst1, lst2):\t\n'''In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers, and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers. There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements. You can exchange any number of elements between lst1 and lst2. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\n    '''"], "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 223}
