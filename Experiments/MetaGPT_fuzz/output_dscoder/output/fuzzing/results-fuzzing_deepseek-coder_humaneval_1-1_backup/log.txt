mutated prompt:
def unique(l: list):	
'''Return sorted unique elements in a list.

Description:
Given a list of integers, your task is to filter out all the unique elements and return them in a sorted order. The function should take a list as input and return a new list containing only the sorted unique integers from the original list. The input list may contain negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers, and duplicates may be present.

Function signature: `def sorted_unique_elements(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:`

Example:
```python
assert sorted_unique_elements([4, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [2, 3, 4, 5]
assert sorted_unique_elements([1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 2]) == [-1, 0, 1, 2]
assert sorted_unique_elements([]) == []
assert sorted_unique_elements([10, 9, 8, 7]) == [7, 8, 9, 10]
assert sorted_unique_elements([5, 5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5]

Constraints:
- The input list can be empty.
- All elements in the list are integers and can be negative.
- The function should not modify the input list; it should create and return a new list.

Your solution should aim for optimal time complexity, preferably O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list.

Description:
Given a list of integers, your task is to filter out all the unique elements and return them in a sorted order. The function should take a list as input and return a new list containing only the sorted unique integers from the original list. The input list may contain negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers, and duplicates may be present.

Function signature: `def sorted_unique_elements(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:`

Example:
```python
assert sorted_unique_elements([4, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [2, 3, 4, 5]

assert sorted_unique_elements([10, 9, 8, 7]) == [7, 8, 9, 10]
assert sorted_unique_elements([5, 5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5]

Constraints:
- The input list can be empty.
- All elements in the list are integers and can be negative.
- The function should not modify the input list; it should create and return a new list.

Your solution should aim for optimal time complexity, preferably O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list.

Given a list containing various data types in Python, your task is to filter out and return only the elements that are integers. For instance, if the input list is [1, 'a', 3.14, True, 5], the output should be [1, 5] because these are the integer values present. Ensure that the filtering process correctly identifies and includes all integer elements, preserving the order of their occurrence in the original list. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as lists that contain no integers or are empty.
