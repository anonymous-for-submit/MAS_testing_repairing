{"task_id": "HumanEval/55", "prompt": "def fib(n: int):\t\n'''Return n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence begins with the numbers 0 and 1. Each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones. Therefore, the third number in the sequence is 1 (0+1), the fourth is 2 (1+1), and so on. To find the n-th number, calculate the sum of the two numbers before it in the sequence recursively or iteratively. You can use loops, recursion, or dynamic programming to implement this logic.\n>>> fib(10)\n    55\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(8)\n    21\n    '''", "entry_point": "fib", "canonical_solution": "    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    return fib(n -
