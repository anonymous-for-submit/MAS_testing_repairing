The function should handle non-empty lists efficiently.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if lst1 can be made all even through swaps with lst2.\n- Ensure the function can handle various input sizes and configurations.\n- Optimize the function for performance and scalability.\n- Provide clear and detailed output for user understanding.\n- Ensure the function is easy to understand and maintain.\nTo implement the function `exchange` that checks if all elements in `lst1` can be made even by swapping elements with `lst2`, we will use Python's built-in data structures and simple logic. The function will iterate through `lst1` to find odd numbers, then attempt to find a corresponding even number in `lst2` for each odd number in `lst1`. If such a swap can make all elements in `lst1` even, the function will return \"YES\"; otherwise, it will return \"NO\".\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.7068, 1.0, 0.7068, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5263, 0.6391, 0.7068], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 94, 133, 94, 133, 133, 133, 70, 85, 94], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef exchange(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if all elements in lst1 can be made even by swapping elements with lst2.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst1 (List[int]): A list of integers where each element is odd.\n        lst2 (List[int]): A list of integers where each element is even.\n        \n    Returns:\n        str: \"YES\" if all elements in lst1 can be made even by swapping, otherwise \"NO\".\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"NO\"\n    \n    # Iterate through lst1 to find odd numbers\n    for num in lst1:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            # Check if there's an even number in lst2 to swap\n            if any(even_num % 2 == 0 and even_num != num for even_num in lst2):\n                result = \"YES\"\n                break\n    \n    return result\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 5, "round": 139, "repair_prompt": ["def exchange(lst1, lst2):\t\n'''In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
