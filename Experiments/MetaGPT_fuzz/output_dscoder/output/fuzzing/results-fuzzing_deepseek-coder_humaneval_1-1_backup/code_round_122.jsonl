We will iterate through the string, keeping track of the number of opening brackets encountered. For each closing bracket, we will decrement this count. If at any point the count goes negative, it means there is an unmatched closing bracket. If the count is zero at the end of the iteration, all brackets are correctly paired.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to check if a string of brackets is correctly paired.
