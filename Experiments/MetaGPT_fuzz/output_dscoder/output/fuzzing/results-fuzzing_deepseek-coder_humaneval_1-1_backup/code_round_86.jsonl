Then, check if there are enough even numbers in `lst2` to replace the odd numbers in `lst1`. This can be efficiently done by using a set to store the even numbers from `lst2` and checking their availability for swaps. The function will return \"YES\" if such a swap is possible, otherwise \"NO\".\n"], "scores": [1.0, 0.782, 0.7068, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6541, 0.6692, 0.9248, 0.9248], "pass_results": [true, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 104, 94, 133, 133, 133, 87, 89, 123, 123], "completion": "from typing import List\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef exchange(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> str:\n    # Identify odd numbers in lst1\n    odd_numbers_in_lst1 = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]\n    \n    # Create a set of even numbers from lst2\n    even_numbers_in_lst2 = set(num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0)\n    \n    # Check if there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace odd numbers in lst1\n    if len(odd_numbers_in_lst1) <= len(even_numbers_in_lst2):\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n", "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 86, "repair_prompt": ["def exchange(lst1, lst2):\t\n'''In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers, and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
