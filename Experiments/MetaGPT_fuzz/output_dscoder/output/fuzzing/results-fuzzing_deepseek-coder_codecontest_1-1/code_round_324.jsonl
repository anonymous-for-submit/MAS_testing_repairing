For the replacement operation, we will use the list's `remove` method followed by an `append` to remove all occurrences of a specified element and replace it with another. We will also ensure that the operations are optimized for large-scale data handling by minimizing the number of iterations over the list during the replacement process.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 324, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext q lines contain queries (one per line).
