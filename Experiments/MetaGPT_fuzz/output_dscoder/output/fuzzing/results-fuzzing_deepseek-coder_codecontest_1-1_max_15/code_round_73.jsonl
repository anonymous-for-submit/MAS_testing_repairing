{"name": "1598_A. Computer Game", "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "tags": ["brute force", "dfs and similar", "dp", "implementation"],

There are traps in some cells and if Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies. The game ends at this point if Monocarp steps on a trap. To beat the level, Monocarp's character needs to reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.

The game is a simple grid-based puzzle with traps that Monocarp needs to navigate without falling into. The goal is to determine if Monocarp can reach the end of the level from the start. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid of safe and trap cells. The output should indicate whether it's possible to complete the level for each test case.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the game logic to check if Monocarp can reach the end cell from the start cell.\n- Handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Ensure the solution is clear and concise for easy understanding and maintenance.\n- Optimize the solution for performance, especially for larger grids.\n- Implement input/output handling to match the specified format.\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and check if Monocarp can reach the end cell from the start cell. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path if one exists. We will implement this in a Python function that takes the number of test cases and the grid for each test case as input and returns 'YES' if Monocarp can complete the level and 'NO' otherwise.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement analysis involves understanding the game mechanics and the constraints given.
