{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops changing.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5\n2 4 1 5 3\n5\n5 3 2 4 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nNote\n\nConsider the fist example.\n\n  * The first eversion: a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3], x = 3. [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. \n  * The second and following eversions: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], x = 5. [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the second example. \n\n  * The first eversion: a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1], x = 1. [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]. \n  * The second eversion: a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], x = 4. [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. \n  * The third and following eversions: a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], x = 5. [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 2.
