This approach will help us efficiently calculate the number of such sequences without generating all possible sequences, which would be computationally expensive for larger values of n.

The nth Catalan number gives the number of ways to form a sequence of balanced parentheses of length 2n. For our problem, we need to extend this concept to binary sequences.
