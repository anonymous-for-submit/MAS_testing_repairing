This approach will be efficient and simple, leveraging Python's dynamic typing and list methods.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that can append a list to a tuple. This is a common task in data manipulation and should be easily accessible and efficient. The function should be compatible with Python's standard library to ensure wide usability.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be simple and readable.\n- The function should handle tuples and lists efficiently.\n- Ensure compatibility with Python versions.\n- Include documentation and examples for easy understanding.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to extend lists and tuples. The function will take a list and a tuple as input, extend the tuple with the list, and return the extended tuple. This approach leverages Python's simplicity and efficiency for such tasks.\n"], "test": ["def check(add_lists):\n\tassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)", "def
