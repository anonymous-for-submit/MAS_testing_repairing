The function should also be well-documented to assist users in understanding its usage and limitations.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the sum of divisors for two integers.\n- The function should handle zero and negative numbers correctly.\n- The implementation should be optimized for performance to handle large numbers efficiently.\n- The function should include detailed documentation and examples to assist users.\n- The code should be tested to ensure it handles all edge cases effectively.\nTo create a function that compares the sum of divisors of two integers, we will use Python's built-in capabilities and leverage a simple and efficient approach. The function will calculate the sum of divisors for each integer, taking into account edge cases such as zero and negative numbers. Performance optimization will be achieved by using efficient algorithms for divisor sum calculation.\n"], "test": ["def check(areEquivalent):\n\tassert areEquivalent(36,57) == False", "def
