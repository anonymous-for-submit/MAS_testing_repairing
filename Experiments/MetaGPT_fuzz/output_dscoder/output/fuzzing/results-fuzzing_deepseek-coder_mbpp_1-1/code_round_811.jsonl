The function should be able to handle non-negative integers and return the sum of these numbers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should accurately calculate the sum of the first n Perrin numbers.\n- The function should be optimized for performance to handle larger values of n.\n- The function should be well-documented and easy to understand.\n- The function should be tested to ensure it handles edge cases and errors correctly.\n- The function should be integrated into a larger project if necessary.\nTo implement the function cal_sum that calculates the sum of the first n Perrin numbers, we will use a simple iterative approach to generate the Perrin sequence up to the nth number and then sum these numbers. This approach ensures efficiency and ease of understanding. We will use Python, a widely-used and well-documented language, to implement this function.\n"], "test": ["def check(cal_sum):\n\tassert cal_sum(9) == 49", "def check(cal_sum):\n\tassert cal_sum(10)
