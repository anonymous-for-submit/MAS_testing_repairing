This is a specific use case that can be useful in various applications where data manipulation is required. The function should be efficient and easy to use, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.\nrequirement pool:\n- The main code should be clear and concise, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n- The function should handle different types of lists and tuples efficiently.\n- The function should be tested thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\n- The documentation should be comprehensive, explaining how to use the function and its limitations.\n- Include examples in the documentation to demonstrate common use cases.\nWe will use Python's built-in capabilities to extend the functionality of tuples by adding lists to them. This approach leverages Python's dynamic nature and the ease of concatenation of lists and tuples.\n"], "test": ["def check(add_lists):\n\tassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)",
