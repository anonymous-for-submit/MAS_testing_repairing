This involves understanding and implementing efficient algorithms for binomial coefficient calculations and their products.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function to calculate binomial coefficients efficiently\n- Optimize the product of consecutive binomial coefficients\n- Ensure the function is easily understandable and maintainable\n- Test the function for accuracy and performance\nTo efficiently calculate the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients, we will utilize Python's built-in math library to handle binomial coefficient calculations. This approach leverages the properties of binomial coefficients to minimize computation time. We will also optimize the product calculation to ensure that the function can handle large inputs without significant performance degradation.\n"], "test": ["def check(sum_Of_product):\n\tassert
