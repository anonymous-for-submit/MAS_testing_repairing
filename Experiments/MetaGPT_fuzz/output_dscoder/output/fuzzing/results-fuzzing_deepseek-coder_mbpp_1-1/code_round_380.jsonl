The total surface area of the tetrahedron will be four times this value.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to create a function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron accurately. This involves understanding the geometric properties of a tetrahedron and applying the appropriate mathematical formula. The function should be user-friendly and capable of handling basic to advanced calculations, depending on the user's needs.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the formula to calculate the surface area of a tetrahedron.\n- Ensure the function is capable of handling different input sizes and types.\n- Include user-friendly error handling and feedback.\n- Allow for customization of output precision.\n- Optimize the function for performance and scalability.\nTo implement the function `area_tetrahedron` for calculating the area of a tetrahedron, we will use the mathematical formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron. The formula involves calculating the area of one triangular face and then multiplying it by four since a tetrahedron has four identical triangular faces. The area of a single triangular face can be calculated using the side length of the tetrahedron. This approach leverages basic geometric principles and ensures the function is both accurate and efficient. The function will be designed to handle floating-point input and will return the result with appropriate precision based on user input or default settings.\n"], "test": ["def
