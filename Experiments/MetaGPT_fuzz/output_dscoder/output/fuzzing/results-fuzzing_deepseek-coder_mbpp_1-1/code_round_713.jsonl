The product should also be optimized for performance to ensure quick and efficient calculations.\nrequirement pool:\n- Develop a function to calculate the surface area of a tetrahedron.\n- Ensure the function is user-friendly and can handle different edge lengths.\n- Optimize the function for performance to handle various inputs.\n- Include support for different units of measurement.\n- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.\nTo create a function that calculates the surface area of a tetrahedron, we will use the formula for the area of a single triangular face and then multiply it by four. The formula for the area of a triangle given its side length 'a' is sqrt(3)/4 * a^2. We will use this formula to calculate the area of each of the four triangular faces and sum them up to get the total surface area.\n"], "test": ["def check(area_tetrahedron):\n\tassert
