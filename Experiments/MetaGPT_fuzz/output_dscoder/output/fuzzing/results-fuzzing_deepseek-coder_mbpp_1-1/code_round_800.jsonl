This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the function count_no_of_ways to calculate the number of ways to paint the fence.\n- Ensure the function handles edge cases such as n=1 or k=1.\n- Optimize the function for large values of n and k.\n- Include user documentation and examples in the function's documentation.\n- Test the function with various inputs to ensure accuracy.\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of ways to paint a fence with a given number of posts and colors, ensuring that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. The key idea is to maintain a state that keeps track of the number of ways to paint the fence up to the current post, considering the last two posts' colors. This approach will help us avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times, thus optimizing the solution.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe requirement is to create a function that calculates the number of ways to paint a fence with a given number of posts and colors, ensuring that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.
