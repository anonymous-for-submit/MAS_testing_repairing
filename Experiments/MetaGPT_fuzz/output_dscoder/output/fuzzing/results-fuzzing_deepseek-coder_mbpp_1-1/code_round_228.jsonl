This is a straightforward task that involves extending the list with the elements of the tuple.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the add_tuple function as described\n- Ensure the function preserves the order of elements in the list\n- Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness\n- Optimize the function for performance if necessary\nTo implement the `add_tuple` function, we will use Python's built-in list and tuple data structures. The function will take a list and a tuple as input, extend the list with the elements of the tuple, and return the modified list. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, leveraging Python's dynamic array capabilities.\n"], "test": ["def check(add_tuple):\n\tassert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]", "def
