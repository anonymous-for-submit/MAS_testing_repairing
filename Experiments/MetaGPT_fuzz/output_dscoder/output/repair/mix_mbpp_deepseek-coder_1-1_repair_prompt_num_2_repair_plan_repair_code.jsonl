The function will be optimized for readability and performance.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'all values in a dictionary are the same'\n    This means that for any given dictionary, all the values must be identical.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the function `check_value`, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, return `True`.\n    2. Extract the first value from the dictionary as a reference.\n    3. Iterate through the dictionary and compare each value to the reference value.\n    4. If any value is different, return `False`.\n    5.

The sizes will then be summed up to provide the total size of the tuple's contents.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'size in bytes': means the memory usage of the elements within a tuple\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    The plan suggests iterating through each element in the tuple and summing up their sizes using `sys.getsizeof()`.\n\n# [edge case] \n    tuple_size(()) = 0\n    Explanation: An empty tuple has no elements, so its size is 0 bytes.\n    tuple_size((1,)) = sys.getsizeof((1,))\n    Explanation: A tuple with one element (e.g., an integer) will have a size greater than 0 bytes, which can be determined using `sys.getsizeof()`.\n    tuple_size((\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")) = sys.getsizeof((\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"))\n    Explanation: This edge case checks if the function correctly calculates the size of a tuple with multiple elements, which should be equal to the size returned by `sys.getsizeof()`.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The logic in the plan already correctly handles the case of an empty tuple and a tuple with multiple elements.\n"], "test": ["def check(tuple_size):\n\tassert tuple_size((\"A\", 1, \"B\", 2, \"C\", 3)

This approach ensures that the function is both simple and efficient.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grouping by first element': This means that we will organize tuples in a list based on their first element.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find all tuples that share the same first element and combine them into a single tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    (1) Create an empty dictionary to store the groups.\n    (2) Iterate through each tuple in the list.\n    (3) For each tuple, check if the first element is already a key in the dictionary.\n    (4) If it is, append the tuple to the list associated with that key.\n    (5) If it is not, create a new key with the first element and initialize it with the current tuple.\n    (6) After processing all tuples, convert the dictionary values to a list of tuples.\n    (7) Return the list of grouped tuples.\n\n# [edge case] \n    group_tuples([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('a', 'd'), ('e', 'f')]) = [('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), ('e', 'f')]\n    Explanation: The tuples are grouped by their first element, and the resulting groups are returned as a list of tuples.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    No extra code is needed for edge cases as the logic provided covers the general case.\n"], "test": ["def check(group_tuples):\n\tassert group_tuples([('x', 'y'), ('x', 'z'), ('w', 't')]) == [('x', 'y', 'z'), ('w', 't')]", "def

This approach ensures that the function is both efficient and concise, aligning with requirement P0.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'tuple comparison': This involves comparing elements of two tuples to find matches or specific relationships between them.\n    Explanation: In this requirement, we need to compare elements of two tuples to find the positions where the elements from the first tuple appear in the second tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the `and_tuples` function, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
