It will handle multiple test cases efficiently.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing pairs': means removing exactly one 'A' and one 'B' or one 'B' and one 'C' from the string, reducing the string's length by 2 each time.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The function will iterate through the string, checking for possible pairs and reducing the string accordingly.

Erase 'A' and 'B' from the string, resulting in an empty string.\n    search(['A', 'B', 'B', 'A']) = YES\n    Explanation: The sequence of actions can be:\n    1. Erase 'A' and 'B' from the string, resulting in 'BA'.\n    2. Erase 'B' and 'A' from the string, resulting in an empty string.\n    search(['A', 'C', 'C', 'A']) = NO\n    Explanation: There are no pairs of 'A' and 'B' or 'B' and 'C' to erase, and the string cannot be reduced to an empty string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The provided logic is sufficient to determine if the string can be reduced to an empty string by erasing pairs.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe problem requires a solution that can determine if a given string can be fully erased by a sequence of two specific actions. The solution should be efficient enough to handle up to 1000 test cases within a reasonable time frame. The actions are straightforward, and the constraints on the string length are manageable, allowing for a variety of approaches.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to check if the string can be fully erased by the given actions.\n- Ensure the solution is optimized for handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Provide clear and concise code to solve the problem.\n- Test the solution with a variety of inputs to ensure robustness.\nWe will use a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. The solution will involve checking the string for the presence of 'AB', 'BC', and 'CA' patterns, which are the only valid sequences for erasing letters. We will iterate through the string and remove these patterns, checking if the string can be fully erased.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'erasing letters': means removing specific letters from the string to achieve a goal\n    'pattern recognition': identifying specific sequences in the string to perform actions\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan involves iterating through the string and checking for the presence of 'AB', 'BC', and 'CA' patterns. If these patterns are found, they are removed from the string. This process is repeated until no more patterns can be found or the string is fully erased.\n\n# [edge case] \n    s = \"A\"\n    explanation: The string consists of a single letter 'A', which cannot be erased by the given rules since no pairs to erase exist.

{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100).

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum).

This requires finding an optimal permutation of points for each question. The system should handle multiple test cases efficiently, with the number of questions and students not exceeding certain limits to ensure performance.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement a function to calculate the surprise value for a given permutation of points.\n- Develop an algorithm to find the optimal permutation of points that maximizes the surprise value.\n- Ensure the system can handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n- Design a user-friendly interface for easy input and output of data.\nTo solve this problem, we will use Python, leveraging its powerful standard library and external libraries where necessary. The main challenge is to find the optimal permutation of points that maximizes the surprise value, which is the sum of the absolute differences between expected and actual scores. We will use a brute-force approach to generate all possible permutations of points and evaluate the surprise value for each permutation. The permutation with the highest surprise value will be selected as the optimal solution.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n It seems like your request was cut off.

The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! (n factorial).\n\n    'surprise value': The surprise value is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the expected points (x_i) and the actual points received (r_i) for all students. The goal is to maximize this value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No specific phrase showing quantity relationship was mentioned in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb was mentioned in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To solve this problem, we need to:\n    1.

The main challenge is to handle large numbers of test cases efficiently while ensuring accurate comparison based on the description of the numbers. We will use basic Python data structures and operations to achieve this.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'positive integer': means the number is greater than 0\n    'zeros': means the number of trailing zeros\n\n    Explanation: The core concepts here are the positive integer and the number of trailing zeros. These are important because they define the format of the numbers we are dealing with.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'followed by': means that the integer is followed by a certain number of zeros\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'greater than': means that one number is larger than another\n    'smaller than': means that one number is smaller than another\n    'equal to': means that two numbers are the same\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the comparison, we will follow these steps:\n    1. Read the number of test cases.\n    2. For each test case, read the two numbers and their respective trailing zeros.\n    3. Compare the numbers based on their values and the number of trailing zeros.\n    4.

The second number is 10 followed by 5 zeros, which is 100000. Since 1000000 is greater than 100000, the output is '>'.\n\n    Test case 2:\n    Input:\n    2\n    10 0\n    100 1\n    Expected Output:\n    '<'\n    Explanation: The first number is 10 with no trailing zeros, which is 10. The second number is 100 followed by 1 zero, which is 1000. Since 10 is smaller than 1000, the output is '<'.\n\n    Test case 3:\n    Input:\n    3\n    123 0\n    123 0\n    Expected Output:\n    '='\n    Explanation: Both numbers are 123 with no trailing zeros.

If t = 2, then the next two integers are i and k (1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 n) \u2014 second-type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every second-type query, print one integer in a new line \u2014 answer to this query.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n5 3 4 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 9\n2 3 5 1 4\n2 3 5\n2 5 5\n2 5 1\n2 5 3\n2 5 4\n1 5 4\n2 5 3\n2 2 5\n2 5 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n5\n4\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example p = \\{5, 3, 4, 2, 1\\}. \n\nThe first query is to print p_3. The answer is 4.\n\nThe second query is to print p_{p_1}. The answer is 1.\n\nThe third query is to swap p_1 and p_3. Now p = \\{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}.\n\nThe fourth query is to print p_{p_1}.

The goal is to minimize the number of such elements to maximize f(a).\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 5\n    explanation: In this case, all elements are already in their correct positions, so no elements need to be removed. The largest possible f(a) is 5.\n    search([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) = 1\n    explanation: In this case, only the element at index 1 (value 5) is in the correct position. Removing any other element will not increase f(a). The largest possible f(a) is 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case. The logic to maximize f(a) inherently handles the scenario where all elements are already in their correct positions.\n"], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 19, "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the initial sequence a.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the largest f(a) that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n2 1 4 2 5 3 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 2 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, f(A) = 3 by doing the following operations.\n\n[2,1,4,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [2,1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3,7] \u2192 [1,2,5,3] \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nIn the second example, f(A) = 2 and no additional operation is needed.", "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "parent_index": 92}
