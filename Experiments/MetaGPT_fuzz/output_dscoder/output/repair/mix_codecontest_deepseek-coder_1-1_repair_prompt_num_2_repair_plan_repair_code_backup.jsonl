Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m.

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1.\n\nHelp him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the original length of the array a. The second line of the description lists n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array a.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of them containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is a single integer \u2014 the maximal possible minimum in a, which can be obtained by several applications of the described operation to it.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n1\n10\n2\n0 0\n3\n-1 2 0\n4\n2 10 1 7\n2\n2 3\n5\n3 2 -4 -2 0\n2\n-1 1\n1\n-2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n10\n0\n2\n5\n2\n2\n2\n-2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example test case, the original length of the array n = 1. Therefore minimum extraction cannot be applied to it. Thus, the array remains unchanged and the answer is a_1 = 10.\n\nIn the second set of input data, the array will always consist only of zeros.\n\nIn the third set, the array will be changing as follows: [\\color{blue}{-1}, 2, 0] \u2192 [3, \\color{blue}{1}] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{2}]. The minimum elements are highlighted with \\color{blue}{blue}. The maximal one is 2.\n\nIn the fourth set, the array will be modified as [2, 10, \\color{blue}{1}, 7] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{1}, 9, 6] \u2192 [8, \\color{blue}{5}] \u2192 [\\color{blue}{3}].

After the first extraction, the array becomes [2, 3] and the smallest element is 2. No further operations can be performed as the array length is now 2, which is not strictly greater than 1. The maximum possible value of the minimum element is 2.\n    Edge case 2:\n    Input: [5, 5, 5]\n    Explanation: All elements are the same.

The maximum possible value of the minimum element is 5.\n    Edge case 3:\n    Input: [10, 10, 30, 20]\n    Explanation: The array has multiple elements. After the first extraction, the array becomes [10, 20, 30] and the smallest element is 10. After the second extraction, the array becomes [20, 30] and the smallest element is 20.

You can perform the following operation with x: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add 0 or 1 to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of x. For example: * 34 can be turned into 81 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 1, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1010001, which is the binary form of 81. * 34 can be turned into 17 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 10001, which is the binary form of 17. * 81 can be turned into 69 via one operation: the binary form of 81 is 1010001, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1000101, which is the binary form of 69. * 34 can be turned into 69 via two operations: first you turn 34 into 81 and then 81 into 69.

The solution should be able to handle large integers efficiently and provide a clear YES/NO output based on whether the transformation is possible.\nrequirement pool:\n- Implement the binary operation as described\n- Ensure the solution can handle large integers\n- Provide a clear and user-friendly output\n- Optimize the algorithm for better performance\n- Consider edge cases and ensure robustness\nTo solve this problem, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible transformations of the binary representation of x. We will convert x to its binary form, perform the allowed operations, and check if we can reach y. The BFS ensures that we explore all possible transformations level by level, which is efficient for this problem.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'binary representation': the way numbers are represented in base 2 using only 0s and 1s.\n    Explanation: In computing, binary is the number system used to represent data stored in computers. It uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. Each digit represents a power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2^0, the next representing 2^1, and so on.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that a value must be greater than a specified amount.\n    Explanation: For example, \"more than 5\" means the value must be greater than 5.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': indicates the greatest value in a set of values.\n    Explanation: For example, \"the largest integer\" means the biggest number in a list of numbers.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible transformations of the binary representation of x. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n    1. Convert x to its binary form.\n    2. Perform the allowed operations: add 0 or 1 to the right and reverse the binary form.\n    3. Check if the transformed value matches y.\n    4. Use a queue to keep track of all possible values of x after each operation, ensuring we explore all possibilities level by level.\n\n# [edge case] \n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) = 2\n    Explanation: The number 2 appears twice, which is more than its value (2), and it is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) = 3\n    Explanation: The number 3 appears three times, which is more than its value (3), and it is the largest integer that meets this condition.\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) = -1\n    Explanation: No number appears more than or equal to its value, so the function returns -1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.

{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible.

Let's proceed with analyzing the core concepts, phrases showing quantity relationships, degree adverbs, and edge cases for the given requirement and plan.\n\n## Prompt 3:\n\n[requirement]\nPetya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not. If the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. For the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test. Your task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Consider all possible scenarios to ensure comprehensive understanding of the permutations. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively. The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get. This is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 {0, 1}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise. The sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4. Output For each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n[plan]\nTo solve this problem, we will use a combination of Python's built-in libraries and common open-source tools.

The goal is to find pairs of positions [i, j] such that after removing the elements at these positions, the mean of the remaining elements is still equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': indicates that we need to find pairs of positions where the sum of the elements at these positions is equal to twice the mean of the entire array.\n    Explanation: For example, if the mean of the array is k, then the sum of the elements at positions [i, j] should be 2k.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': suggests that we need to find the largest possible pairs of positions that meet the condition.\n    Explanation: In the context of the problem, finding the largest pairs means identifying the pairs with the highest values that still satisfy the condition of resulting in the same mean after removal.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the solution, we need to:\n    1. Calculate the mean of the array.\n    2. Iterate through all pairs of positions [i, j] where i < j.\n    3. Check if the sum of the elements at positions [i, j] is equal to twice the mean.\n    4. Count the number of such pairs.\n    5. Return the count.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge case 1: n = 3, array = [1, 2, 3]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: With only three elements, it's impossible to remove any two elements and still have the mean of the remaining elements be the same as the original mean.\n\n    Edge case 2: n = 4, array = [1, 3, 2, 4]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is (1+3+2+4)/4 = 2.5. The only pair [i, j] that satisfies the condition is [0, 3] since (3+2)/2 = 2.5.\n\n    Edge case 3: n = 5, array = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n    Expected output: 10\n    Explanation: The mean of the array is 5. Any pair of positions will result in the mean of the remaining elements being 5, so there are 10 possible pairs.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where n is very small or the array elements are all the same.\n    For example, if n < 3, return 0 since it's impossible to remove two elements. If all elements are the same, calculate the number of pairs directly since any pair will work.\n", "requirement analysis:\nThe primary requirement is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions results in the mean of the remaining elements remaining unchanged.

{"name": "1619_H. Permutation and Queries", "description": "You are given a permutation p of n elements. A permutation of n elements is an array of length n containing each integer from 1 to n exactly once. For example, [1, 2, 3] and [4, 3, 5, 1, 2] are permutations, but [1, 2, 4] and [4, 3, 2, 1, 2] are not permutations. You should perform q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries:\n\n  * 1 x y \u2014 swap p_x and p_y. \n  * 2 i k \u2014 print the number that i will become if we assign i = p_i k times. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers. The first integer is t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2) \u2014 type of query. If t = 1, then the next two integers are x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; x \u2260 y) \u2014 first-type query. If t = 2, then the next two integers are i and k (1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 n) \u2014 second-type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every second-type query, print one integer in a new line \u2014 answer to this query.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n5 3 4 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 9\n2 3 5 1 4\n2 3 5\n2 5 5\n2 5 1\n2 5 3\n2 5 4\n1 5 4\n2 5 3\n2 2 5\n2 5 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n5\n4\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example p = \\{5, 3, 4, 2, 1\\}. \n\nThe first query is to print p_3. The answer is 4.\n\nThe second query is to print p_{p_1}. The answer is 1.\n\nThe third query is to swap p_1 and p_3. Now p = \\{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}.\n\nThe fourth query is to print p_{p_1}.

{"name": "1613_C. Poisoned Dagger", "description": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum

The approach involves stripping the trailing zeros from both numbers and then comparing the remaining numerical values. This method ensures that we handle large numbers and trailing zeros effectively while keeping the solution simple and easy to understand.\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'trailing zeros': These are zeros appended to the end of a number, which do not affect the numerical value but can affect comparisons.\n    Explanation: In the given problem, the numbers are represented as x with p zeros appended to its end. For example, if x is 123 and p is 2, the number becomes 12300.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that one number has a greater value than another, considering the trailing zeros.\n    Explanation: For instance, if we have two numbers 12300 (x1=123, p1=2) and 1230 (x2=123, p2=1), the first number is greater than the second because the trailing zeros do not change the numerical value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': This adverb indicates that a number is greater than another in terms of its numerical value without considering trailing zeros.\n    Explanation: In the example above, 12300 is the largest number because it has a higher numerical value (123) compared to 1230.\n\n# [code logic]\n    (check if there are steps should be considered simultaneously)\n    To implement the comparison, we can follow these steps:\n    1. Strip the trailing zeros from both numbers.\n    2. Compare the lengths of the numbers after stripping the trailing zeros.\n    3. If the lengths are different, the number with the longer length is larger.\n    4.

For example, if we have two numbers 12300 (x=123, p=2) and 1230 (x=123, p=1), we need to remove 2 and 1 zeros respectively and then compare the remaining numbers.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'largest': means the number with the most trailing zeros.\n    'smallest': means the number with the least trailing zeros.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to compare the numbers based on the number of trailing zeros they have. For example, if we have two numbers 12300 (x=123, p=2) and 1230 (x=123, p=1), the first number is larger because it has more trailing zeros.\n\n# [code logic]\n    To implement the solution, we will follow these steps:\n    1.
