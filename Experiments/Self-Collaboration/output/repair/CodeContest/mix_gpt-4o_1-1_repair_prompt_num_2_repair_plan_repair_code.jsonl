At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.\n\nEach person has limited sociability. The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.\n\nA meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.\n\nYou are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible. The goal is to ensure that no sociability potential is wasted while maximizing interpersonal engagements.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014the number of people in the meeting. The second line consists of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the sociability parameters of all people. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all a_i (over all test cases and all i) does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all test cases.\n\nOn the first line of each answer print the number k \u2014 the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting.\n\nOn each of the next k lines print two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i \u2260 j) \u2014 the numbers of people

Filled cells ('X') are not exitable.\n\n    'determinable'\n    Explanation: A grid or subgrid is determinable if, based on the exitable cells, you can exactly determine which cells are filled and which are empty.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No explicit phrases showing quantity relationships are present in the requirement.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverbs are present in the requirement.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for marking exitable cells and preprocessing the grid to identify determinable subgrids should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while marking exitable cells, you can simultaneously track transitions from exitable to non-exitable cells to facilitate the preprocessing step.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. A grid with all cells empty:\n       Input: \n       ```\n       3 3\n       ...\n       ...\n       ...\n       1\n       1 3\n       ```\n       Expected Output: YES\n       Explanation: All cells are exitable, and the grid is determinable as there are no filled cells.\n\n    2.

You can calculate exitability for the entire grid first and then use this information to quickly check determinability for each subgrid query.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1: A grid with all cells empty.\n    Expected Output: YES for all queries.\n    Explanation: Since all cells are empty, every cell is exitable, and the grid is trivially determinable.\n\n    Edge Case 2: A grid with all cells filled.\n    Expected Output: NO for all queries.\n    Explanation: Since no cell is exitable, the grid is not determinable.\n\n    Edge Case 3: A grid with alternating filled and empty cells in a checkerboard pattern.\n    Expected Output: Depends on the specific query, but generally NO for larger subgrids.\n    Explanation: The exitability pattern does not uniquely determine the filled and empty cells due to the alternating pattern.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Code for handling the edge case:\n    - Implement a function to calculate exitability for each cell.\n    - Use a data structure to efficiently check determinability for each query based on the exitability information.\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Parse the input\n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    m = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(data[index])\n        index += 1\n    \n    q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(q):\n        x1 = int(data[index])\n        x2 = int(data[index + 1])\n        queries.append((x1, x2))\n        index += 2\n    \n    # Calculate exitability\n    exitable = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # First row and first column are trivially exitable if empty\n    for j in range(m):\n        if grid[0][j] == '.':\n            exitable[0][j] = True\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][0] == '.':\n            exitable[i][0] = True\n    \n    # Calculate exitability for the rest of the grid\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, m):\n            if grid[i][j] == '.':\n                if exitable[i-1][j] or exitable[i][j-1]:\n                    exitable[i][j] = True\n    \n    # Precompute determinability information\n    determinable = [True] * m\n    for j in range(1, m):\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if exitable[i][j] and not exitable[i][j-1] and exitable[i-1][j]:\n                determinable[j] = False\n                break\n    \n    # Answer queries\n    results = []\n    for x1, x2 in queries:\n        if all(determinable[x1-1:x2]):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass_after_repair": 2, "pass@10_after_repair": true, "pass@1_after_repair": 0.2, "pass@1_after_repair_ogis": 0.2}

There are 10^9+7 cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once. Additionally, he provided Q queries that you need to answer about the connections. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from L_{i} to R_{i} on that list using only roads of length D_{i}. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and Q (1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 2\u22c510^5 ) \u2014 the length of the array of cities and the number of queries you need to answer. \n\nThe second lines contains N integers representing the array of cites.

Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers a or say that it is impossible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^3) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of cities. The second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^{9}) \u2014 the total duration of concerts in i-th city.\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the answer as follows:\n\nIf there is no suitable sequence a, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES, on the next line print the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n of n integers, where a_i (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}) is the initial duration of repertoire of the i-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n12 16 14\n1\n1\n3\n1 2 3\n6\n81 75 75 93 93 87\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n3 1 3 \nYES\n1 \nNO\nYES\n5 5 4 1 4 5 \n\nNote\n\nLet's consider the 1-st test case of the example:\n\n  1. the 1-st singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 6 minutes, in the 3-rd \u2014 for 9 minutes; \n  2. the 2-nd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 3 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 1 minute, in the 3-rd - for 2 minutes; \n  3. the 3-rd singer in the 1-st city will give a concert for 6 minutes, in the 2-nd \u2014 for 9 minutes, in the 3-rd \u2014 for 3 minutes. \n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them, allowing travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate; to travel from the x-th room to the y-th room requires a tunnel between x and y, consuming max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n).

a_y|), where a_x and a_y are the illusion rates of the rooms.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)': This phrase indicates that the energy required to travel between two rooms is the maximum of the absolute values of the sum and the difference of their illusion rates. In code, this can be implemented using the `max` function and `abs` function in Python.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum': In the context of query type 2, it refers to finding the path between two rooms that requires the least amount of energy. This can be implemented using a pathfinding algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS/DFS with appropriate energy calculations.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for handling query type 1 and query type 2 should be implemented separately, as they involve different operations (updating a value vs. calculating a path). However, the energy calculation for query type 2 should be optimized to handle multiple queries efficiently, possibly using precomputation or data structures like segment trees.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Consider the following edge cases:\n    1.

In this problem, it represents the maze structure where rooms are nodes and tunnels are edges.\n\n    'illusion rate'\n    Explanation: This is a value associated with each room that affects the energy cost of traveling through tunnels.\n\n    'energy'\n    Explanation: The energy required to travel between two rooms is determined by the formula max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|), where a_x and a_y are the illusion rates of the rooms.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)': This phrase indicates that the energy cost is the maximum of the absolute values of the sum and difference of the illusion rates of two connected rooms. In code, this can be implemented using the `max` function and `abs` for absolute value.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum': In the context of the type 2 query, it refers to finding the path with the least energy cost between two rooms. This can be implemented using algorithms like Dijkstra's or BFS with priority queues to find the shortest path in terms of energy cost.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for handling type 1 and type 2 queries should be implemented in separate functions, but the data structure for the tree and the illusion rates should be shared. The update and query operations should be efficient, possibly using a segment tree or similar data structure for fast updates and queries.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Minimum number of rooms and queries: n = 2, q = 1\n       Explanation: This tests the smallest possible input size.\n    2. All rooms have the same illusion rate: a_i = 0 for all i\n       Explanation: This tests if the code correctly handles zero illusion rates, which should result in zero energy cost for any path.\n    3. Maximum illusion rate change: a_i changes from 0 to 10^9\n       Explanation: This tests if the code can handle large changes in illusion rates without overflow or performance issues.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, especially for efficiently updating and querying the tree structure.\n    -

For a tree with k levels, it has 2^k - 1 nodes.\n\n    'Rubik's cube colors'\n    Explanation: The colors are White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange, and Yellow, and they have specific neighboring rules that must be followed for valid colorings.\n\n    'neighboring sides'\n    Explanation: This refers to the constraints on which colors can be adjacent to each other based on the Rubik's cube configuration.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2^k - 1': This indicates the number of nodes in the perfect binary tree.

Notice that this problem has a key difference; unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "completions": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        d = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            # Perform the cyclic shift\n            a_shifted = [a[(i + n -

This means the array is a rearrangement of the numbers 1 through n without repetition.\n\n    'queries'\n    Explanation: Queries are operations or requests for information that need to be processed. In this context, there are two types of queries: one for swapping elements and another for calculating a value based on repeated assignments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at least one second-type query'\n    Explanation: This means that among the queries provided, there is guaranteed to be at least one query of the second type. This ensures that the program will always have to handle at least one calculation query.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for handling type 1 and type 2 queries should be implemented separately as they involve different operations. However, within the handling of type 2 queries, the repeated assignment operation should be implemented in a loop that iterates k times.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Input: 1 1\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: With only one element, any swap operation is invalid, and any type 2 query will return the element itself.\n\n    2.

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].

The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}.

If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 5 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.

The goal is to find the city with the highest enjoyment value that can be reached by each tour group.\n\n    'capacity'\n    Explanation: This refers to the maximum number of vehicles that a road can accommodate. It is a constraint for determining which cities can be reached by a tour group.\n\n    'toll'\n    Explanation: This is the cost associated with traveling on a road. The task is to calculate the maximum toll cost per vehicle for reaching the city with the highest enjoyment value.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'highest possible enjoyment value': This means finding the maximum enjoyment value among the cities that can be reached by the tour group.\n    'maximum toll cost per vehicle': This means finding the highest toll cost that needs to be paid per vehicle to reach the city with the highest enjoyment value.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'highest': This indicates that we need to find the maximum enjoyment value among the reachable cities.\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the highest toll cost per vehicle among the roads used to reach the city with the highest enjoyment value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for parsing input, constructing the graph, and performing graph traversal should be implemented sequentially. However, during the graph traversal, the steps for tracking the maximum enjoyment value and calculating the toll cost should be considered simultaneously. This can be done by updating both the enjoyment value and toll cost as each city is reached during the traversal.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. A tour group with a size larger than any road capacity starting from a city with the highest enjoyment value.\n       Example: If a tour group of size 10 starts at a city with enjoyment value 5, but all roads have a capacity less than 10, the output should be 5 0.\n       Explanation: The group cannot move, so the highest enjoyment value is the starting city, and no toll is paid.\n\n    2. A tour group starting at a city with the lowest enjoyment value but can reach a city with the highest enjoyment value without any toll.\n       Example: If a tour group starts at a city with enjoyment value 1 and can reach a city with enjoyment value 5 without any toll, the output should be 5 0.\n       Explanation: The group can reach the highest enjoyment value city without paying any toll.\n\n    3. A tour group starting at a city with multiple paths to a city with the highest enjoyment value, but one path has a higher toll.\n       Example: If a tour group starts at a city and can reach a city with enjoyment value 5 through two paths, one with a toll of 3 and another with a toll of 5, the output should be 5 5.\n       Explanation: The group can choose the path with the highest toll to reach the highest enjoyment value city.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    -

The goal is to find the highest enjoyment value reachable by each tour group.\n\n    'capacity' and 'toll'\n    Explanation: Capacity refers to the maximum number of vehicles that can travel on a road between two cities. Toll is the cost per vehicle for using that road. These factors determine which cities a tour group can reach and the cost associated with reaching them.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'highest possible enjoyment value'\n    Explanation: This means finding the maximum enjoyment value among the cities that a tour group can reach. In code, this can be implemented by iterating over reachable cities and keeping track of the maximum enjoyment value.\n\n    'amount of money per vehicle'\n    Explanation: This refers to the maximum toll cost per vehicle that Omkar needs to reimburse for the tour group to reach the city with the highest enjoyment value. In code, this involves calculating the tolls for the paths taken and finding the maximum.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'highest'\n    Explanation: This indicates the need to find the maximum enjoyment value among reachable cities. In code, this can be implemented using a max function or similar logic to track the highest value.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for determining reachable cities and calculating maximum enjoyment and toll costs should be implemented simultaneously for each tour group. This involves performing a graph traversal to find reachable cities and then calculating the enjoyment and tolls in the same traversal.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. A tour group with a size larger than any road capacity starting at a city with the highest enjoyment value.\n       Example: If a tour group starts at a city with the highest enjoyment value and cannot move due to road capacity, the output should be the enjoyment value of the starting city and 0 toll.\n       Explanation: The group cannot move, so the highest enjoyment is at the starting city, and no toll is incurred.\n\n    2. All roads have a capacity less than the number of vehicles in the tour group.\n       Example: If all roads are impassable due to capacity constraints, the output should be the enjoyment value of the starting city and 0 toll.\n       Explanation: The group cannot travel to any other city, so the enjoyment value is that of the starting city, and no toll is incurred.\n\n    3. A tour group starting at a city with the lowest enjoyment value but can reach a city with the highest enjoyment value without any toll.\n       Example: If a path exists with zero tolls to a city with the highest enjoyment value, the output should be the highest enjoyment value and 0 toll.\n       Explanation: The group can reach the city with the highest enjoyment value without incurring any tolls.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the tour group cannot move due to capacity constraints or where tolls are zero.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(tour_group, starting_city, roads, enjoyment_values):\n        if all(road.capacity < tour_group.size for road in roads):\n            return enjoyment_values[starting_city], 0\n        # Additional logic to handle zero toll paths\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    q = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    enjoyment_values = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n    index += n\n    \n    roads = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n -

The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so. You should consider edge cases, such as when N is less than 5 or when there are no friendships at all.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i.

Each room is a connected component in the grid.\n\n    'wall arrangements'\n    Explanation: Wall arrangements determine the connectivity between tiles. Tiles with certain wall configurations are considered part of the same room if they are connected.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'biggest to smallest'\n    Explanation: This indicates that the room sizes need to be sorted in descending order, from the largest room size to the smallest.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'biggest'\n    Explanation: Refers to the largest room size in terms of the number of connected tiles. This is implemented by sorting the room sizes in descending order.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for parsing input and determining room sizes should be implemented simultaneously using a graph traversal technique (DFS or BFS) to efficiently navigate the grid and identify connected components.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Input: 1 1\n           1\n    Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one tile, the room size is 1.\n\n    Input: 2 2\n           1 1\n           1 1\n    Output: 4\n    Explanation: All tiles are connected, forming one room of size 4.\n\n    Input: 3 3\n           1 0 1\n           0 0 0\n           1 0 1\n    Output: 1 1 1 1 1\n    Explanation: Each '1' is isolated, forming rooms of size 1.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        (code for handling isolated tiles and single tile grid)\n        if n == 1 and m == 1:\n            print(1)\n            return\n        #

This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element, but allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment, ensuring the chosen indices follow the constraint of starting from 1 and not exceeding n, and that indices l and r follow the given constraint carefully. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d; for example, the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift to the left by the offset 2. For example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8] which is shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, resulting in a segment [8, 3, 2] replacing the original elements of the segment and leading to a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5]. Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments; any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted. Ensure your solution is efficient and handles edge cases effectively.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.", "The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n]. This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element, but allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment, ensuring the chosen indices follow the constraint of starting from 1 and not exceeding n. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d; for example, the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift to the left by the offset 2. For example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8] which is shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, resulting in a segment [8, 3, 2] replacing the original elements of the segment and leading to a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5]. Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments; any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted. Ensure your solution is efficient and handles edge cases effectively.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

This ensures the solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'arbitrary'\n    Explanation: The offset for the cyclic shift can be any value within the allowed range, providing flexibility in how the segment is rearranged.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Check Sorted\" and \"Sort Using Cyclic Shifts\" should be considered simultaneously. If the array is already sorted, no cyclic shifts are needed, and the output should be 0 actions. Otherwise, identify segments for cyclic shifts to sort the array.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with already sorted array:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no cyclic shifts are needed.\n\n    Test case with all elements the same:\n    Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: The array is trivially sorted as all elements are the same, requiring no shifts.\n\n    Test case with smallest possible array:\n    Input: [2, 1]\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: A single cyclic shift of the segment [1, 2] is needed to sort the array.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

If the position goes out of bounds, adjust the starting position or terminate the sequence.\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def find_best_starting_position(n, m, s):\n    # Initialize variables to track the robot's position and boundaries\n    min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = 0, 0, 0, 0\n    current_row, current_col = 0, 0\n\n    # Iterate over each command in the sequence s\n    for command in s:\n        if command == 'L':\n            current_col -= 1\n        elif command == 'R':\n            current_col += 1\n        elif command == 'U':\n            current_row -= 1\n        elif command == 'D':\n            current_row += 1\n\n        # Update boundaries\n        min_row = min(min_row, current_row)\n        max_row = max(max_row, current_row)\n        min_col = min(min_col, current_col)\n        max_col = max(max_col, current_col)\n\n        # Check if the robot's position approaches the boundary of the field\n        if max_row -

\"Simulate the movement of the robot starting from each possible initial position within the field.\"\n    - \"For each initial position, execute the command sequence and update the position of the robot.\"\n    - \"Check if the robot stays within the boundaries of the field during the entire sequence.\"\n    - \"Track the initial position that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without going out of bounds.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a loop that iterates over all possible starting positions and simulates the command sequence for each.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: n = 1, m = 1, s = \"L\"\n    Expected Output: 1 1\n    Explanation: The board is 1x1, so any movement will result in going out of bounds. The only valid starting position is (1, 1).\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 2, m = 2, s = \"RRUU\"\n    Expected Output: 1 1\n    Explanation: Starting at (1, 1), the robot will move out of bounds after the first command. The best starting position is still (1, 1) as no position allows executing more than 0 commands.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 3, m = 3, s = \"DDRRUU\"\n    Expected Output: 1 1\n    Explanation: Starting at (1, 1), the robot can execute the first two commands before going out of bounds. No other starting position allows executing more commands.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should ensure that the robot does not start from a position that would immediately result in going out of bounds. This can be handled by checking the boundaries before executing each command.\n\n    Example code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def is_within_bounds(r, c, n, m):\n        return 1 <= r <= n and 1 <= c <= m\n\n    for r in range(1, n + 1):\n        for c in range(1, m + 1):\n            current_r, current_c = r, c\n            for command in s:\n                if command == 'L':\n                    current_c -= 1\n                elif command == 'R':\n                    current_c += 1\n                elif command == 'U':\n                    current_r -= 1\n                elif command == 'D':\n                    current_r += 1\n                if not is_within_bounds(current_r, current_c, n, m):\n                    break\n            # Track the best starting position based on the number of commands executed\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def find_best_starting_position(n, m, s):\n    # Initialize the starting position\n    min_r, min_c = 0, 0\n    max_r, max_c = 0, 0\n    current_r, current_c = 0, 0\n\n    # Calculate the min and max bounds of the robot's path\n    for command in s:\n        if command == 'L':\n            current_c -= 1\n        elif command == 'R':\n            current_c += 1\n        elif command == 'U':\n            current_r -= 1\n        elif command == 'D':\n            current_r += 1\n\n        min_r = min(min_r, current_r)\n        max_r = max(max_r, current_r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, current_c)\n        max_c = max(max_c, current_c)\n\n    # Calculate the best starting position\n    start_r = 1 - min_r\n    start_c = 1 - min_c\n\n    # Ensure the starting position is within the board's boundaries\n    if start_r + max_r >= n:\n        start_r = n - max_r\n    if start_c + max_c >= m:\n        start_c = m - max_c\n\n    return start_r, start_c\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n\n        r, c = find_best_starting_position(n, m, s)\n        results.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass_after_repair": 2, "pass@10_after_repair": true, "pass@1_after_repair": 0.2, "pass@1_after_repair_ogis": 0.2}
