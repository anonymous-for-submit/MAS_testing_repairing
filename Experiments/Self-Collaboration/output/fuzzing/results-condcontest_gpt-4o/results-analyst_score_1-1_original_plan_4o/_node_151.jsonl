{"index": 56, "parent": 2, "child": [97], "score": true, "passes": 6, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "prompt": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions. The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them, allowing travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate; to travel from the x-th room to the y-th room requires a tunnel between x and y, consuming max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 -

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you substitute the segment a[l \u2026 r] with its cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "completions": ["def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_chars = set(s)\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in unique_chars:\n        filtered_string = [c for c in s if c != char]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered_string):\n            deletions = len(s) -

For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i. If b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations. The number of them is exactly r - l + 1. \n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer

Call a cell in this grid exitable if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself. Therefore, all filled in cells are not exitable because they do not allow exit through empty cells. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ...

E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    .

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it. Additionally, it has an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled. If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle. That way, he can guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

There are 10^9+7 cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once. Additionally, he provided Q queries that you need to answer about the connections. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from L_{i} to R_{i} on that list using only roads of length D_{i}. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and Q (1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 2\u22c510^5 ) \u2014 the length of the array of cities and the number of queries you need to answer. \n\nThe second lines contains N integers representing the array of cites. Next Q lines contain three integers L, R and D (1 \u2264 L_{i}, R_{i} \u2264 N, 0 \u2264 D_{i} \u2264 10^9+6) \u2014 the range of cities that needs to be connected and the length of the road that you can use. \n\nOutput\n\nThe output contains Q lines.

The people of Baltia want to organize a successful party, but they have very strict rules on what a party is and when the party is successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i.

You understand your mission is to create factory facilities, but before you initiate, you need information about the size of the factory and the total number of rooms it contains. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. \n\nThen in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct. \n\nYour task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction.

Now he will split the sequence a into one or more consecutive subarrays so that each element of a belongs to exactly one subarray. Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Consider edge cases where some subsequences could be empty.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, where |s| is the length of the string s), consisting only of characters a and/or b.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the resulting string s with \\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s) you'll get making the minimum number of steps.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nb\naabbbabaa\nabbb\nabbaab\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nb\naabbbabaa\nbbbb\nabbaaa\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, both \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 0 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0 (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave s untouched.\n\nIn the second test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 2, so you can leave s untouched. \n\nIn the third test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 0. For example, we can change s_1 to b and make both values zero.\n\nIn the fourth test case, \\operatorname{AB}(s) = 2 and \\operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. For example, we can change s_6 to a and make both values equal to 1.", "completions": ["def balance_ab_ba(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for s in test_cases:\n        ab_count = 0\n        ba_count = 0\n        \n        # Count occurrences of 'ab' and 'ba'\n        for i in range(len(s) -

The rows on the board are numbered from top to bottom starting at 1, while columns are numbered from left to right beginning at 1.\n\nThe robot is capable of moving from its current position to any of the four adjacent cells.\n\nThe robot follows a given sequence of commands, denoted by the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D', or 'U', which correspond to movements to the left, right, down, or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot is free to begin its journey from any cell. It follows the commands in the exact order they are presented in the sequence s. Moving off the board results in the robot falling and breaking, and such a command isn't counted as successful.\n\nThe goal for the robot is to carry out as many commands as it can without falling off the board. For instance, on a 3 \u00d7 3 board, if the robot begins the sequence s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the center, it will execute one command, but the next will make it cross the edge. Starting from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column), the robot will execute all commands and finish at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves to the right twice, down, left, and up twice. In this situation, it concludes at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nFigure out the starting cell for the robot to maximize the execution of commands without going off the board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2", "completions": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        #

In this game, his character must defeat a dragon. The fight with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is executed at the start of the a_i-th second from the beginning of the battle. The dagger doesn't inflict damage directly, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which causes 1 damage in each of the following k seconds (starting from the same second when the dragon was injected with poison). However, if the dragon is already under the poison's effects, the dagger refreshes the poison effect (meaning it cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor instance, assume k = 4, and Monocarp strikes the dragon at seconds 2, 4 and 10. Therefore, the poison effect begins at the start of the 2-nd second and causes 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; subsequently, at the start of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, resulting in exactly 1 damage during seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is activated again, dealing 1 damage during seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. Thus, the dragon receives 10 damage in total.\n\nMonocarp understands that the dragon has h hit points, and if he causes at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he defeats the dragon. Monocarp is undecided about the potency of the poison to use in the battle, so he seeks to determine the smallest possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect persists) that suffices to inflict no less than h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64

You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. This operation allows you to balance out the heights. Trading blocks can help achieve a more uniform look.\n\n\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.

He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it.\n\nFor example, word \"abbaaba\" contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. After that, Polycarp writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. He then wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'. It should be possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists.

As listed in the statement, it contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nIn the first testcase, the 5-th bigram is removed. \n\nIn the second testcase, the 2-nd bigram is removed. However, that sequence could also have been produced from the word \"abaabaa\". It contains bigrams \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\" and \"aa\".

Furthermore, once they arrived at each town, the i-th singer got inspired and came up with a new song that lasts a_i minutes. This new song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.\n\nHence, for the i-th singer, the concert in the i-th town will last a_i minutes, in the (i + 1)-th town the concert will last 2 \u22c5 a_i minutes, ..., in the ((i + k) mod n + 1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k + 2) \u22c5 a_i, ..., in the town ((i + n - 2) mod n + 1) \u2014 n \u22c5 a_i minutes.\n\nYou are given an array of b integer numbers, where b_i is the total duration of concerts in the i-th town.

At each next step, she performs the same operation on each pair of digits in the same place and writes the result to the left side of the answer.\n\nFor example, the numbers a = 17236 and b = 3465 Tanya adds up as follows:\n\n$$$ \\large{ \\begin{array}{r} + \\begin{array}{r} 17236\\\\\\ 03465\\\\\\ \\end{array} \\\\\\ \\hline \\begin{array}{r} 1106911 \\end{array} \\end{array}} $$$\n\n  * calculates the sum of 6 + 5 = 11 and writes 11 in the answer.\n  * calculates the sum of 3 + 6 = 9 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to produce 911.\n  * calculates the sum of 2 + 4 = 6 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 6911.\n  * calculates the sum of 7 + 3 = 10, and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 106911.\n  * calculates the sum of 1 + 0 = 1 and writes the result to the left side of the answer and get 1106911.\n\nAs a result, she gets 1106911.\n\nYou are given two positive integers a and s. Find the number b such that by adding a and b as described above, Tanya will get s. Or determine that no suitable b exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers a and s (1 \u2264 a < s \u2264 10^{18}) separated by a space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer on a separate line.\n\nIf the solution exists, print a single positive integer b. The answer must be written without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.\n\nIf no suitable number b exists, output -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n17236 1106911\n1 5\n108 112\n12345 1023412\n1 11\n1

So imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n, and the i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once; in other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work.

{"index": 86, "parent": 55, "child": [140], "score": true, "passes": 8, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "prompt": "A robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). It is important to understand this notation. The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print an integer \u2014 the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell. We can show that the robot always cleans the dirty cell eventually.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n10 10 6 1 2 8\n10 10 9 9 1 1\n9 8 5 6 2 1\n6 9 2 2 5 8\n2 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n7\n10\n9\n3\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the floor has the size of 10\u00d7 10. The initial position of the robot is (6, 1) and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 8). See the illustration of this example in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example, the floor is the same, but the initial position of the robot is now (9, 9), and the position of the dirty cell is (1, 1). In this example, the robot went straight to the dirty cell and clean it. \n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, the floor has the size 9 \u00d7 8. The initial position of the robot is (5, 6), and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 1). \n\n<image>\n\nIn the fourth example, the floor has the size 6 \u00d7 9. The initial position of the robot is (2, 2) and the position of the dirty cell is (5, 8). \n\n<image>\n\nIn the last example, the robot was already standing in the same column as the dirty cell, so it can clean the cell right away. \n", "completions": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index +=

Grandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome; she wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s. She also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern; please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose. A string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not. Consider edge cases where the entire string is already a palindrome or consists of only one character.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "completions": ["def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_chars = set(s)\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in unique_chars:\n        filtered = [c for c in s if c != char]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            deletions = len(s) -

{"index": 91, "parent": 79, "child": [127], "score": true, "passes": 5, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "prompt": "Polycarp has come up with a new game to play with you. He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it. A bigram is essentially a pair of letters that are right next to each other in a word. \n\nFor example, word \"abbaaba\" contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. After that, Polycarp writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. He then wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'. It should be possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n7\nab bb ba aa ba\n7\nab ba aa ab ba\n3\naa\n5\nbb ab bb\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nabbaaba\nabaabaa\nbaa\nbbabb\n\nNote\n\nThe first two testcases from the example are produced from the word \"abbaaba\". As listed in the statement, it contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nIn the first testcase, the 5-th bigram is removed. \n\nIn the second testcase, the 2-nd bigram is removed. However, that sequence could also have been produced from the word \"abaabaa\". It contains bigrams \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\" and \"aa\". The missing bigram is the 6-th one.\n\nIn the third testcase, all of \"baa\", \"aab\" and \"aaa\" are valid answers.", "completions": ["def reconstruct_words(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, bigrams in test_cases:\n        word = bigrams[0][0]  #

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, and the capacity denotes the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it. Additionally, it has an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled. If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle. That way, he can guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 3 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Consider edge cases where some subsequences could be empty. The solution should account for sequences of minimal length, including those having only one element in a subsequence or being empty entirely.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n7\n1 3 4 2 2 1 5\n3\n1 3 4\n5\n1 3 2 4 2\n4\n4 3 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, YouKn0wWho can split the sequence in the following way: [1, 3, 4], [2, 2], [1, 5]. This way, the LIS lengths are h = [3, 1, 2], and the bitwise XOR of the LIS lengths is 3 \u2295 1 \u2295 2 = 0.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to split the sequence into subarrays that will satisfy the condition.", "completions": ["import sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence_length(arr):\n    lis = []\n    for x in arr:\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(lis, x)\n        if pos == len(lis):\n            lis.append(x)\n        else:\n            lis[pos] = x\n    return len(lis)\n\ndef can_split_sequence(n, sequence):\n    #

The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them, allowing travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a_i illusion rate; to travel from the x-th room to the y-th room requires a tunnel between x and y, consuming max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy, where |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it, and Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done: * 1\\ u\\ c \u2014 The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 |c| \u2264 10^9). * 2\\ u\\ v \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure! Consider providing an efficient algorithm to handle these queries within the constraints provided.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 |a_i| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.\n\nThe next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n39\n32\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.\n\n  * 1 \u2192 5 \u2014 takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 -

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); \n  * or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). \n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.", "completions": ["def

{"index": 106, "parent": 9, "child": [], "score": false, "passes": 0, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "prompt": "You are given an array a[0 \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Notice that this problem has a key difference; unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "completions": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        d = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            # Perform the cyclic shift\n            a_shifted = [a[(i + n -

A tree with n nodes is a connected undirected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges; note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once. Here is an example of a tree: \n\n<image>\n\nA restriction consists of 3 pairwise distinct integers, a, b, and c (1 \u2264 a,b,c \u2264 n). It signifies that node b cannot lie on the simple path between node a and node c. Can you help Lord Omkar and become his most trusted disciple? You will need to find heavenly trees for multiple sets of restrictions. It can be shown that a heavenly tree will always exist for any set of restrictions under the given constraints.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m < n), representing the size of the tree and the number of restrictions.\n\nThe i-th of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, c_i (1 \u2264 a_i, b_i, c_i \u2264 n, a, b, c are distinct), signifying that node b_i cannot lie on the simple path between nodes a_i and c_i. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n-1 lines representing the n-1 edges in the tree. On each line, output two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v) signifying that there is an edge between nodes u and v.

The simple path between 3 and 5 is 3, 5, which doesn't contain 4. The simple path between 5 and 7 is 5, 3, 1, 2, 7, which doesn't contain 6.

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n). Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k. Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the

any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is

Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days? Ensure your solution efficiently handles large values of n and optimizes for time complexity. Assume n is a positive integer and Petya's watering pattern is provided as an array of boolean values.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower

You have the task of breaking exactly one of these sticks into two pieces. The breaking must ensure that both pieces have positive (strictly greater than 0) integer lengths. Additionally, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must equal the original length of the stick, and it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks such that each stick is used as exactly one of its sides. A square is also considered a rectangle. Determine if it's possible to do that.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe only line of each testcase contains three integers l_1, l_2, l_3 (1 \u2264 l_i \u2264 10^8) \u2014 the lengths of the sticks.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces with positive integer length in such a way that it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks.

Grandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome; she wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s, aiming to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern; please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose. A string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not. Consider edge cases where the entire string is already a palindrome or consists of only one character.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases.

You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "completions": ["def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_removals_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_letters = set(s)\n    min_removals = float('inf')\n    \n    for letter in unique_letters:\n        filtered = [c for c in s if c != letter]\n        if is_palindrome(filtered):\n            removals = len(s) -

A party on Baltia comprises exactly 5 people and is considered successful if either all are friends allowing uninterrupted conversation, or no two are friends enabling phone engagement without disturbance. Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.

Let's denote a path of calculations for a segment [l; r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) in the following way: \n\n* Let x=1 initially. For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i, and if b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations, and the number of them is exactly r - l + 1.\n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, and the capacity denotes the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it. Additionally, it has an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled. If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle. That way, he can guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose. Omkar is looking forward to seeing the smiles on the faces of the tourists as they enjoy all that Omkarland has to offer!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines. The i-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the i-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the i-th tour group.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n2 2 3 3 3\n1 2 4 7\n1 3 2 8\n2 4 8 2\n2 5 1 1\n1 3\n9 5\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 8\n3 0\n3 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 4 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 2 1\n2 5 1 1\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5\n1 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 8\n1 3 6 3\n1 4 4 5\n1 5 7 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 8\n2 8\n2 3\n2 1\n1 0\n\nNote\n\nA map of the first sample is shown below.

Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Let's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n; for example, for n = 4 number 17 is special because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0.\n\nYou have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. The solution should account for sequences of minimal length, including those having only one element in a subsequence or being empty entirely.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n7\n1 3 4 2 2 1 5\n3\n1 3 4\n5\n1 3 2 4 2\n4\n4 3 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, YouKn0wWho can split the sequence in the following way: [1, 3, 4], [2, 2], [1, 5].

{"index": 127, "parent": 91, "child": [], "score": true, "passes": 2, "mutate_method": "add_1_sentence_at_end", "prompt": "Polycarp has come up with a new game to play with you. He calls it \"A missing bigram\".\n\nA bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it. A bigram is essentially a pair of letters that are right next to each other in a word. \n\nFor example, word \"abbaaba\" contains bigrams \"ab\", \"bb\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\nThe game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. After that, Polycarp writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. He then wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. You can assume that the length of the original word is at least three characters.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'. It should be possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists.

She is adding two numbers a and b using the following algorithm:\n\n  1. If one of the numbers is shorter than the other, Tanya adds leading zeros so that the numbers are the same length.\n  2. The numbers are processed from right to left (that is, from the least significant digits to the most significant). \n  3. In the first step, she adds the last digit of a to the last digit of b and writes their sum in the answer.\n  4. At each next step, she performs the same operation on each pair of digits in the same place and writes the result to the left side of the answer.\n\nFor example, the numbers a = 17236 and b = 3465 Tanya adds up as follows:\n\n$$$ \\large{ \\begin{array}{r} + \\begin{array}{r} 17236\\\\\\ 03465\\\\\\ \\end{array} \\\\\\ \\hline \\begin{array}{r} 1106911 \\end{array} \\end{array}} $$$\n\n  * calculates the sum of 6 + 5 = 11 and writes 11 in the answer.\n  * calculates the sum of 3 + 6 = 9 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to produce 911.\n  * calculates the sum of 2 + 4 = 6 and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 6911.\n  * calculates the sum of 7 + 3 = 10, and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get 106911.\n  * calculates the sum of 1 + 0 = 1 and writes the result to the left side of the answer and get 1106911.\n\nAs a result, she gets 1106911.\n\nYou are given two positive integers a and s. Find the number b such that by adding a and b as described above, Tanya will get s. Or determine that no suitable b exists. Note that b can include leading zeros to satisfy the addition process.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers a and s (1 \u2264 a < s \u2264 10^{18}) separated by a space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer on a separate line.\n\nIf the solution exists, print a single positive integer b. The answer must be written without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.\n\nIf no suitable number b exists, output -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n17236 1106911\n1 5\n108 112\n12345 1023412\n1 11\n1

You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:\n\n  * Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j), and move a block from tower i to tower j. This essentially decreases a_i by 1 and increases a_j by 1. This operation allows you to balance out the heights. Trading blocks can help achieve a more uniform look.\n\nYou think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)-min(a). \n\nWhat's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days? Note that an optimal strategy is needed to minimize the ugliness efficiently.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of buildings.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n10 10 10\n4\n3 2 1 2\n5\n1 2 3 1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the ugliness is already 0.\n\nIn the second test case, you should do one operation, with i = 1 and j = 3.

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you substitute the segment a[l \u2026 r] with its cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the specified array a using not more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\n\n  * he can either remove exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from any positions in the string (these letters don't have to be beside each other); \n  * or he can remove exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from any positions in the string (these letters don't have to be beside each other). \n\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\n\nFor example, with s = \"ABCABC\" he can obtain a string s = \"ACBC\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\n\nFor a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case is described by one string s, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1 to 50 letters, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nABACAB\nABBA\nAC\nABC\nCABCBB\nBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBC\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES", "completions": ["def can_be_fully_erased(s):\n    count_A = s.count('A')\n    count_B = s.count('B')\n    count_C = s.count('C')\n    \n    # Check if the number of 'B' is equal to the sum of 'A' and 'C'\n    return count_B == count_A + count_C\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        if can_be_fully_erased(s):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def can_be_fully_erased(s):\n    count_A = s.count('A')\n    count_B = s.count('B')\n    count_C = s.count('C')\n    return count_B == count_A + count_C\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        if can_be_fully_erased(s):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def can_be_fully_erased(s):\n    count_A = s.count('A')\n    count_B = s.count('B')\n    count_C = s.count('C')\n    return count_B == count_A + count_C\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        if can_be_fully_erased(s):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nmain()", "def can_be_fully_erased(s):\n    count_A = s.count('A')\n    count_B = s.count('B')\n    count_C = s.count('C')\n    \n    # Check if the number of 'A's is equal to the number of 'C's\n    if count_A -

The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). It is crucial to comprehend this notation. The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print an integer \u2014 the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell. We can show that the robot always cleans the dirty cell eventually.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n10 10 6 1 2 8\n10 10 9 9 1 1\n9 8 5 6 2 1\n6 9 2 2 5 8\n2 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n7\n10\n9\n3\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the floor has the size of 10\u00d7 10. The initial position of the robot is (6, 1) and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 8). See the illustration of this example in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example, the floor is the same, but the initial position of the robot is now (9, 9), and the position of the dirty cell is (1, 1). In this example, the robot went straight to the dirty cell and clean it. \n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, the floor has the size 9 \u00d7 8. The initial position of the robot is (5, 6), and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 1). \n\n<image>\n\nIn the fourth example, the floor has the size 6 \u00d7 9. The initial position of the robot is (2, 2) and the position of the dirty cell is (5, 8). \n\n<image>\n\nIn the last example, the robot was already standing in the same column as the dirty cell, so it can clean the cell right away. \n", "completions": ["def robot_cleaner():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        r_b = int(data[index + 2])\n        c_b = int(data[index + 3])\n        r_d = int(data[index + 4])\n        c_d = int(data[index + 5])\n        index += 6\n        \n        time = 0\n        dr, dc = 1, 1\n        \n        while True:\n            # Check if the robot is in the same row or column as the dirty cell\n            if r_b == r_d or c_b == c_d:\n                results.append(time)\n                break\n            \n            # Move the robot\n            r_b += dr\n            c_b += dc\n            time += 1\n            \n            # Reflect dr if hitting horizontal walls\n            if r_b == 1 or r_b == n:\n                dr = -dr\n            \n            # Reflect dc if hitting vertical walls\n            if c_b == 1 or c_b == m:\n                dc = -dc\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nrobot_cleaner()\n\nmain()", "def robot_cleaner():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        r_b = int(data[index + 2])\n        c_b = int(data[index + 3])\n        r_d = int(data[index + 4])\n        c_d = int(data[index + 5])\n        index += 6\n        \n        # Calculate the time to reach the dirty cell\n        # The robot cleans the dirty cell when it is in the same row or column\n        # Calculate the minimum time to reach the same row or column\n        if r_b <= r_d:\n            time_to_row = r_d -

Thus she has been appointed to help maintain trains.\n\nThere are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment. In the beginning, there are no trains, at each of the following m days, one train will be added, or one train will be removed. When a train of model i is added at day t, it works for x_i days (day t inclusive), then it is in maintenance for y_i days, then in work for x_i days again, and so on until it is removed.\n\nIn order to make management easier, Nitori wants you to help her calculate how many trains are in maintenance in each day.\n\nOn a day a train is removed, it is not counted as in maintenance. Ensure that your solution is efficient enough to handle large values of n and m.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i,y_i (1 \u2264 x_i,y_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers op, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, op = 1 or op = 2). If op=1, it means this day's a train of model k is added, otherwise the train of model k is removed. It is guaranteed that when a train of model x is added, there is no train of the same model in the department, and when a train of model x is removed, there is such a train in the department.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines, The i-th of these lines contains one integers, denoting the number of trains in maintenance in the i-th day.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4\n10 15\n12 10\n1 1\n1 3\n1 1\n2 1\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 1\n10000000 100000000\n998244353 1\n2 1\n1 2\n1 5\n2 5\n1 5\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first example:\n\nThe first day: Nitori adds a train of model 3.

All students will be divided into two groups, each attending exactly one lesson each week on one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) on different days, and furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students. Each student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not. Your task is to determine if it is possible to choose two different week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of t testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains 5 integers, each of them is 0 or 1. If the j-th integer is 1, then the i-th student can attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. If the j-th integer is 0, then the i-th student cannot attend the lessons on the j-th day of the week. \n\nAdditional constraints on the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is convenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to divide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days for the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of their group, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n4\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n2\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there is a way to meet all the constraints.

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key is associated with a distinct lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\".\n\nCalculate the amount of time it will require to type the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
