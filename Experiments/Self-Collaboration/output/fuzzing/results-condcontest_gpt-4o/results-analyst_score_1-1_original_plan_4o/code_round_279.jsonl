{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

rectangle A with dimensions n by m. Inside are n rows and m columns consisting of blocks. Each block in the rectangle may be an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM has the ability to transform an obsidian block into an empty one or vice versa in just one operation.\n\nA rectangle M that is a \u00d7 b in size is considered a portal only if it meets certain requirements:\n\n  * a must be at least 5, and b must be at least 4.\n  * Every block M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} must be an obsidian block for all 1 < x < a.\n  * Every block M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} must be an obsidian block for all 1 < x < b.\n  * Every block M_{x,y} must be empty for all 1<x<a,1<y<b.\n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nKeep in mind that there must be a rows and b columns, as opposed to b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type.\n\nCQXYM is curious about the fewest number of steps needed to convert at least one sub-rectangle into a portal.\nThe rectangle A can have various configurations of blocks. Consider edge cases where n or m is less than required dimensions for forming a portal. This problem requires efficiently determining the optimal sequence of transformations to achieve the desired configuration.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9 9\n001010001\n101110100\n000010011\n100000001\n101010101\n110001111\n000001111\n111100000\n000110000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the final portal is like this:\n    \n    \n      \n    1110  \n    1001  \n    1001  \n    1001  \n    0111  \n    \n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format.
