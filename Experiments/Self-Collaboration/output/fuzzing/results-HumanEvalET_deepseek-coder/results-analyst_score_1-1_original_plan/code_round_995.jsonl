There are n cars driving left to right; at the same time, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong. As a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    '''\n    # Each set of cars will collide with the other set exactly n times.\n    return n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0109, 1.0, 0.9891, 1.0, 0.0109, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0109], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [0, 92, 1, 92, 91, 92, 1, 0, 92, 1], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 4, "round": 995, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 629}
