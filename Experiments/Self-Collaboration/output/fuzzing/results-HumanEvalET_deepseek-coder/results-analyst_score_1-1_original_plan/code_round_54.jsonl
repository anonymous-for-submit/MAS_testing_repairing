{"task_id": "HumanEval/68", "prompt": "def pluck(arr):\t\n'''Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes your task is to pluck one of the nodes. You need to return the plucked node after you pluck it. The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.

If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\nExample 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the
