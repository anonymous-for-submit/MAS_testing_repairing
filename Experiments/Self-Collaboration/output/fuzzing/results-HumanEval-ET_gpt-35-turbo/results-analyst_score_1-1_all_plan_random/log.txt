'''Return sorted unique elements in a list.

Description:
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the unique integers from the original list, sorted in ascending order. The input list may contain duplicate values, and the output should not contain any duplicates. Your function should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with all identical elements.

Additional Notes: Ensure your solution demonstrates efficient time complexity for handling larger input lists.

    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number

    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...

    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    The function should return the count of these prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
