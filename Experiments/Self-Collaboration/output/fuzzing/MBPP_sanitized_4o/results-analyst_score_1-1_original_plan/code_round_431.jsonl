{"source_file": "Benchmark Questions Verification V2.ipynb", "task_id": 250, "prompt": "**Description:** The function should iterate through the tuple and count how many times the specified element appears. Ensure the function handles tuples with different data types and returns an integer count of the occurrences.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The element can be of any data type.\n- The tuple provided can be empty or contain multiple elements.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(input_tuple, element):\n    pass\n\ntuple_1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 1)\nelement_1 = 1\ncount_occurrences(tuple_1, element_1) # Output: 3\n\ntuple_2 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple')\nelement_2 = 'apple'\ncount_occurrences(tuple_2, element_2) # Output: 2\n```\n\n**Expectations:**\n- Develop the function without importing additional libraries.\n- Ensure the function logic is simple, clear, and efficient.\n\n**Additional Feature:** Consider edge cases where the tuple might have elements of complex datatypes such as other tuples or lists.", "code": "def count_X(tup, x): \n    count = 0\n    for ele in tup: \n        if (ele == x): \n            count = count + 1\n    return count ",
