Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days consecutively, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower

He decided to compose a problemset for a training session for his teams.\n\nMonocarp has n problems that none of his students have seen yet. The i-th problem has a topic a_i (an integer from 1 to n) and a difficulty b_i (an integer from 1 to n). All problems are different. This means there are no two tasks that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.\n\nMonocarp decided to select exactly 3 problems from n problems for the problemset. The problems should satisfy at least one of two conditions (possibly, both):\n\n  * the topics of all three selected problems are different; \n  * the difficulties of all three selected problems are different. \n\nYour task is to determine the number of ways to select three problems for the problemset.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 50000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of problems that Monocarp have.\n\nIn the i-th of the following n lines, there are two integers a_i and b_i (1 \u2264 a_i, b_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the topic and the difficulty of the i-th problem.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no two problems that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the number of ways to select three training problems that meet either of the

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. The goal is to find a starting cell that maximizes the number of successful moves. Consider edge cases where the board is very small or the command sequence contains moves in only one direction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero. They are not numbered from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{\u2192 d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{\u2192 d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\u2192 d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing.

The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.

{"index": 35, "parent": 12, "child": [40], "score": true, "passes": 7, "mutate_method": "condense_two2one", "prompt": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right. The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, with the goal to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

The first integer is t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2) \u2014 type of query. If t = 1, then the next two integers are x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; x \u2260 y) \u2014 first-type query.

The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. The sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given, each command denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', triggering the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, executing the commands from the first one in s strictly in order, but falls and breaks if it moves beyond the board's edge, rendering a command causing it to break unsuccessfully executed. The robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board; for example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if starting a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, it performs one command before the next forces it over the edge. If starting from cell (2, 1), all commands succeed, stopping the robot in cell (1, 2). The robot starts from cell (2, 1), moves right, right, down, left, up, and up, ending in cell (1, 2). Determine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to execute the most commands; the goal is finding a starting cell that maximizes successful moves, considering edge cases like a very small board or commands moving in a single direction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

Let's denote k as the math mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer).\n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i.e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264

Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid). Make sure to consider the changes in direction as balls progress through the grid for accurate final positioning. It's important to account for the fact that each ball modifies the grid as it travels through.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3).

Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively.

The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side, executing the sequence of commands s given, with each command denoted by 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' for moving left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, executing the commands from the first one in s strictly in order, but falls and breaks if it moves beyond the board's edge, rendering a command causing it to break unsuccessfully executed. The robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board; for example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if starting a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, it performs one command before the next forces it over the edge. If starting from cell (2, 1), all commands succeed, stopping the robot in cell (1, 2). The robot starts from cell (2, 1), moves right, right, down, left, up, and up, ending in cell (1, 2). Determine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to execute the most commands; the goal is finding a starting cell that maximizes successful moves, considering edge cases like a very small board or commands moving in a single direction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right, and the robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. * If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. * If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, with the goal to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Ensure your solution efficiently handles larger board sizes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

Let's denote k as the math mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer).\n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i.e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a). It is guaranteed that the array size is at least 3.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array

them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1

The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side, executing the sequence of commands s given, with each command denoted by 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' for moving left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, executing the commands from the first one in s strictly in order, but falls and breaks if it moves beyond the board's edge, rendering a command causing it to break unsuccessfully executed. The robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board; for example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if starting a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, it performs one command before the next forces it over the edge. If starting from cell (2, 1), all commands succeed, stopping the robot in cell (1, 2). The robot starts from cell (2, 1), moves right, right, down, left, up, and up, ending in cell (1, 2). Determine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to execute the most commands; the goal is finding a starting cell that maximizes successful moves, considering edge cases like a very small board or commands moving in a single direction. Pay special attention to scenarios where the sequence of commands may form a loop.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns from 1 to m from left to right, and the robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board or appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, with the goal to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Ensure your solution efficiently handles larger board sizes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side, executing the sequence of commands s given, with each command denoted by 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' for moving left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, executing the commands from the first one in s strictly in order, but falls and breaks if it moves beyond the board's edge, rendering a command causing it to break unsuccessfully executed. The robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board; for example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if starting a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, it performs one command before the next forces it over the edge. If starting from cell (2, 1), all commands succeed, stopping the robot in cell (1, 2). The robot starts from cell (2, 1), moves right, right, down, left, up, and up, ending in cell (1, 2). Determine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to execute the most commands; the goal is finding a starting cell that maximizes successful moves, considering edge cases like a very small board or commands moving in a single direction. Pay special attention to scenarios where the sequence of commands may form a loop.

The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

Let's denote k as the math mean of these elements. Please note that it's possible that k is not an integer.\n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i.e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a). It is guaranteed that the array size is at least 3.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array

The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side, executing the sequence of commands s given, with each command denoted by 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' for moving left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, executing the commands from the first one in s strictly in order, but falls and breaks if it moves beyond the board's edge, rendering a command causing it to break unsuccessfully executed. The robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board; for example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if starting a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, it performs one command before the next forces it over the edge. If starting from cell (2, 1), all commands succeed, stopping the robot in cell (1, 2). The robot starts from cell (2, 1), moves right, right, down, left, up, and up, ending in cell (1, 2). Determine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to execute the most commands; the goal is finding a starting cell that maximizes successful moves, considering edge cases like a very small board or commands moving in a single direction. Pay special attention to scenarios where the sequence of commands may form a loop. Ensure to consider the performance implications for large values of n and m. Consider optimizing your solution to handle cases efficiently where the length of the command sequence s is significantly large compared to the board dimensions.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

For instance, \\operatorname{AB}(aabbbabaa) = 2 because there are two indices i: i = 2 where aabbbabaa and i = 6 where aabbbabaa.\n\nConsider devising a strategy that balances the substring counts with minimal alterations.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000).

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this situation, it finishes in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nSpecify the cell from which the robot should initiate its movement so it can perform the maximum number of commands possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this situation, it finishes in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nSpecify the cell from which the robot should initiate its movement so it can perform the maximum number of commands possible. Consider edge cases where multiple starting positions may result in the maximum number of executed commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

It is guaranteed that the array size is at least 3.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}),

The rows are numbered from 1 to n starting at the top to the bottom, while the columns are numbered from 1 to m starting from the left side to the right.\n\nThe robot can transition from its current position to any of the four neighboring cells.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is signified by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D', or 'U', prompting movement to the left, right, down, or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can begin moving from any cell. The robot processes the commands starting with the first one, following the exact order in which they are arranged in s. If the robot goes beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command resulting in the robot breaking is not deemed successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's objective is to carry out the maximum number of commands without falling off the board. For example, on a 3 \u00d7 3 board, if the robot initiates a sequence of instructions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the center cell, it will execute one command, then the subsequent command will lead it to cross the edge. If the robot starts its movement from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be completed successfully, and the robot will come to a stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this scenario, it concludes at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to perform the maximum number of commands possible. Consider edge cases where different starting positions might lead to the maximum number of executed commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The rows are numbered from 1 to n starting at the top to the bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to m starting from the left side to the right.\n\nThe robot can transition from its current position to any of the four neighboring cells.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is signified by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D', or 'U', prompting movement to the left, right, down, or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can begin moving from any cell. The robot processes the commands starting with the first one, following the exact order in which they are arranged in s. If the robot goes beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command resulting in the robot breaking is not deemed successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's objective is to carry out the maximum number of commands without falling off the board. For example, on a 3 \u00d7 3 board, if the robot initiates a sequence of instructions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the center cell, it will execute one command, then the subsequent command will lead it to cross the edge. If the robot starts its movement from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be completed successfully, and the robot will come to a stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot begins at cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this scenario, it concludes at cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement to perform the maximum number of commands possible. Consider edge cases where different starting positions might lead to the maximum number of executed commands.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematical average of an array with n elements is calculated by dividing the total sum of the elements by their count (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to remove exactly two elements from a so that the average of the remaining (n - 2) elements remains equal to k.\n\nYour task is to compute how many pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) exist such that if the elements at these positions are removed, the average of the (n - 2) remaining elements equals k (which is the same as the mathematical average of the initial n elements in array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematical average of an array with n elements is calculated by dividing the total sum of the elements by their count (i. e. sum divided by n).\n\nMonocarp wants to remove exactly two elements from a so that the average of the remaining (n - 2) elements remains equal to k.\n\nYour task is to compute how many pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) exist such that if the elements at these positions are removed, the average of the (n - 2) remaining elements equals k (which is the same as the mathematical average of the initial n elements in array a). The array can contain both positive and negative integers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original

of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns from 1 to m from left to right, and the robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell \u2014 left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell, then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board or appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell, with the goal to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Ensure your solution efficiently handles larger board sizes. Consider edge cases where the board might contain only one row or one column.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4\u22c510^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m; d \u2265 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematical average of an array with n elements is calculated by dividing the total sum of the elements by their count. In other words, you get the sum of all the elements and divide it by n to find the average.\n\nMonocarp wants to remove exactly two elements from a so that the average of the remaining (n - 2) elements remains equal to k.\n\nYour task is to compute how many pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) exist such that if the elements at these positions are removed, the average of the (n - 2) remaining elements equals k (which is the same as the mathematical average of the initial n elements in array a). The array can contain both positive and negative integers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1

If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros.", "completions": ["def cyclic_shift_and_operation(t, test_cases):\n    def cyclic_shift(a, d):\n        return a[-d:] + a[:-d]\n\n    def

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer).\n\nThe mathematical average of an array with n elements is calculated by dividing the total sum of the elements by their count. To calculate the average, you take the sum of all the elements in the array. You then divide this resultant sum by n, which is the count of the elements.\n\nMonocarp wants to remove exactly two elements from a so that the average of the remaining (n - 2) elements remains equal to k.\n\nYour task is to compute how many pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) exist such that if the elements at these positions are removed, the average of the (n - 2) remaining elements equals k (which is the same as the mathematical average of the initial n elements in array a). The array can contain both positive and negative integers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "completions": ["from collections import defaultdict\n\ndef calculate_pairs(t, testcases):\n    def calculate_mean(arr):\n        return sum(arr) /
