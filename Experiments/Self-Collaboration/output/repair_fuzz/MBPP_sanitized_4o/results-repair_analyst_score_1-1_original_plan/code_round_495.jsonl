smallest number of rotations needed to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The step 4 and 5 should be implemented simultaneously as they involve the iterative process of rotating the string until a match is found.\n    This can be achieved by using a while loop to continuously rotate the string and check for a match with the original string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    find_Rotations(\"aaaa\") = 1\n    Explanation: Since the input string is already the same, only one rotation is needed to match the original string.\n\n    find_Rotations(\"ababab\") = 3\n    Explanation: The string \"ababab\" requires 3 rotations to match the original string.\n\n    find_Rotations(\"abcde\") = 5\n    Explanation: Each rotation shifts the string by one position, so it takes 5 rotations to get back to the original string.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if len(set(string)) == 1:\n            return 1\n
