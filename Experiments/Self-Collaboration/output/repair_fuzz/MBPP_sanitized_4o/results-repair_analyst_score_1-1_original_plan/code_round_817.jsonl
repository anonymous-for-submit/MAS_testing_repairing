relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they involve different subproblems and actions that need to be taken step by step.\n\n# [edge case] \n    frequency_lists([]) == {}\n    Explanation: When the input list of lists is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary as there are no elements to count.\n    frequency_lists([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]) == {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3}\n    Explanation: All elements in the flattened list appear three times, so the expected output is a dictionary with each element mapped to 3.\n    frequency_lists([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]) == {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1}\n    Explanation: Each element in the flattened list appears twice except for 1 and 4 which appear only once.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
