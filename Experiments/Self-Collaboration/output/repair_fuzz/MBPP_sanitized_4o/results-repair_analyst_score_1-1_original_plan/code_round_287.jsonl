'perfect squares'\n    Explanation: Perfect squares are numbers that are the result of squaring an integer, for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented step by step as they are sequential and do not require simultaneous execution.\n\n# [edge case] \n    perfect_squares(1, 30) == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n    Explanation: The perfect squares between 1 and 30 are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.\n\n    perfect_squares(10, 20) == [16]\n    Explanation: The only perfect square between 10 and 20 is 16.\n\n    perfect_squares(5, 5) == [4]\n    Explanation: The only perfect square between 5 and 5 is 4.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
