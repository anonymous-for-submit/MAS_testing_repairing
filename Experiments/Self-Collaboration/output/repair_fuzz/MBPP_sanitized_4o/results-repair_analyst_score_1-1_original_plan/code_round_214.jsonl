of numbers grouped together in a specific order.\n\n    'product of consecutive elements'\n    Explanation: Refers to the result of multiplying each number in the tuple with the number that follows it.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they involve validating input, iterating through the tuple, and storing results in a new tuple.\n\n# [edge case] \n    multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)\n    Explanation: The first element 1 is multiplied by the next element 5 to get 5, then 5 is multiplied by 7 to get 35, and so on.\n\n    multiply_elements((2, 0, 3, 4)) == (0, 0, 12)\n    Explanation: The second element 0 multiplied by the next element 3 results in 0, and 0 multiplied by 4 also results in 0.\n\n    multiply_elements((1, 2, 3)) == (2, 6)\n    Explanation: The first element 1 multiplied by the next element 2 results in 2, and 2 multiplied by 3 results in 6.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
