'uneven elements': Elements that are not even numbers in the nested mixed tuple\n    Explanation: The core concept here is to identify and remove elements that are not even numbers from the nested mixed tuple.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they involve different operations for handling even and nested elements.\n\n# [edge case] \n    extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)\n    Explanation: In the given nested mixed tuple, the function should remove the uneven elements (5 and 7) and return the tuple with only even elements.\n\n    extract_even((1, (3, (5, 7)), 9)) == ()\n    Explanation: In this case, all elements are uneven, so the expected output is an empty tuple.\n\n    extract_even((2, (4, (6, 8)), 10)) == (2, (4, (6, 8)), 10)\n    Explanation: All elements in the nested mixed tuple are even, so the function should return the original tuple.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        def extract_even(tuple):\n
