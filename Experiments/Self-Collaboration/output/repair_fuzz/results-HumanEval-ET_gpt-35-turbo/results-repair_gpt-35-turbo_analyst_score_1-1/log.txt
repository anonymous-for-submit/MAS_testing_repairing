The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note: 
1. Collatz(1) is [1].
2. returned list sorted in increasing order.
For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

'''You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions. The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class, and the strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName. If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should choose the one that comes first in the list. For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension (its strength is -1).

Implement a function that filters an input list of strings, returning only those that contain the given substring.

Ensure the solution is efficient and clearly handles different variations of cases within the strings.

# Input
- A list of strings.
- A substring to search for within the list.

# Output
- A list of strings from the input where each string contains the given substring.

# Function Signature
```python
def filter_strings_containing_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:

# Example
```python
assert filter_strings_containing_substring(["hello", "world", "he"], "he") == ["hello", "he"]
assert filter_strings_containing_substring(["foo", "bar", "baz"], "qux") == []
assert filter_strings_containing_substring(["abc", "def", "ghi"], "a") == ["abc"]

# Constraints
- All strings in the list consist only of lowercase English letters.
- The list may be empty.
- Strings in the list may be of varying lengths.

# Additional Information
Consider how you might modify the approach to make it more efficient or handle special cases.

'''Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c

    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.

    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)

 def pluck(arr):	
'''    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Ensure that the function is optimized for performance, particularly for large arrays."
Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value
