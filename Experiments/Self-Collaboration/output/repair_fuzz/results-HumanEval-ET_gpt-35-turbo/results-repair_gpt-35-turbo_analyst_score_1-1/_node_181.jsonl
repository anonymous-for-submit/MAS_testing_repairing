The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment finally crystallize into a vivid memory. They are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\nexample:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    '''", "completions": ["from typing import *\ndef compare(game, guess):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(game)):\n        result.append(abs(game[i] -

Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order. You should verify if the resulting string will be good. A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string '())' is not. Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.\nExamples:\n    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    '''", "completions": ["from typing import *\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    concatenated_string = lst[0] + lst[1]\n    \n    stack = []\n    for char in concatenated_string:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if not stack:\n                return 'No'\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    if not stack:\n        return 'Yes'\n    else:\n        return 'No'\n\n# Test cases\nprint(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  #
