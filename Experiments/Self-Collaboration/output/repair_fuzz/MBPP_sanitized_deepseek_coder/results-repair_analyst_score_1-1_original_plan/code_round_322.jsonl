[core concept]\n    'non-negative integer': means that the integer is 0 or positive\n    'prime number': means a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself\n\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to ensure the input is a non-negative integer and then count the prime numbers that are less than the provided non-negative integer.\n\n# [phrase showing
