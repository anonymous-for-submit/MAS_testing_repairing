The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. This allows the smaller elements to move \"gaps\" faster, and thus reduces the total number of comparisons needed to sort the array.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing
