If the number is prime, the largest divisor is 1. Otherwise, we need to find the largest divisor by iterating from n-1 down to 2.\n\n# [edge case] \n    largest_divisor(1) = -1\n    Explanation: For a very small positive integer like 1, there is no divisor smaller than itself, so the expected output is -1.\n    largest_divisor(17) = 1\n    Explanation: 17 is a prime number, so the largest divisor is 1.\n    largest_divisor(15) = 5\n    Explanation: The largest divisor of 15 that is smaller than 15 is 5.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n        if n <= 1:\n            return -1\n        (other code)\n\n# NO", "Round_0": {"code": "def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"For a given number n, determine the largest number that divides n evenly.\n    It must be smaller than n.
