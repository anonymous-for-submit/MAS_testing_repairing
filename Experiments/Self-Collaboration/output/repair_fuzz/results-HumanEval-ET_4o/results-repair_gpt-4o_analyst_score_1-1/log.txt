        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

'''We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N]. The numbers in the array will be randomly ordered, and your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times. One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction, with the last element of the array moving to the 0th index. If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation, then return True; else return False. If the given array is empty then return True. Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.
For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given

    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the point of collision for each pair of cars.

    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements, sorted in ascending order. If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty list.

You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName. If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should choose the one that comes first in the list. For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension (its strength is -1).
Example:

        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.
