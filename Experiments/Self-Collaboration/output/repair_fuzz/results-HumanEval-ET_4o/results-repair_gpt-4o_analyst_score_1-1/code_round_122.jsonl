The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.\n    Examples\n        bf(\"Jupiter\", \"Neptune\") ==> (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\")\n        bf(\"Earth\", \"Mercury\") ==> (\"Venus\")\n        bf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\") ==> (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\")\n    '''\n    \n    # List of planets ordered by their proximity to the sun\n    planets = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n    \n    # Validate the input planet names\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    # Find the index positions of planet1 and planet2\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    # Determine the range between the two indices and extract the planets within this range\n    if index1 < index2:\n        result = planets[index1 + 1:index2]\n    else:\n        result = planets[index2 + 1:index1]\n    \n    # Return the sorted planets as a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n", "from typing import *\ndef bf(planet1, planet2):\n    planets = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n    \n    # Validate the input planet names\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    # Find the indices of planet1 and planet2 in the list\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    # Determine the range of indices between planet1 and planet2 based on their order\n    if index1 < index2:\n        return tuple(planets[index1 + 1:index2])\n    else:\n        return tuple(planets[index2 + 1:index1])\n", "from typing import *\ndef bf(planet1, planet2):\n    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']\n    \n    # Validate the input planet names\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    # Find the indices of planet1 and planet2\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    # Determine the start and end indices for slicing\n    start, end = sorted((index1, index2))\n    \n    # Extract the sublist of planets between the start and end indices\n    result = planets[start + 1:end]\n    \n    # Convert the sublist to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n"], "session_history": {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Validate the input planet names to ensure they are correct.\",\n      \"details\": \"Check if both planet1 and planet2 are valid planet names from the list of eight planets in our solar system.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine the order of the planets based on their proximity to the sun.\",\n      \"details\": \"Create a list or dictionary that maps each planet to its position in the solar system.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify the planets that lie between the orbits of planet1 and planet2.\",\n      \"details\": \"Find the indices of planet1 and planet2 in the ordered list and extract the sublist of planets between these indices.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Return the result as a tuple.\",\n      \"details\": \"Convert the sublist of planets into a tuple and return it as the result.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Create a list of planets ordered by their proximity to the sun: ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'].\",\n    \"Validate that both planet1 and planet2 are in the list of planets.
