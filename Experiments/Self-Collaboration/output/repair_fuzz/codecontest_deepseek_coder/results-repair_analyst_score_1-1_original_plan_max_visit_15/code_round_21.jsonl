{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops changing.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5\n2 4 1 5 3\n5\n5 3 2 4 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nNote\n\nConsider the fist example.\n\n  * The first eversion: a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3], x = 3. [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. \n  * The second and following eversions: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], x = 5. [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the second example. \n\n  * The first eversion: a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1], x = 1. [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]. \n  * The second eversion: a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], x = 4. [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. \n  * The third and following eversions: a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], x = 5. [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 2.

partitioning an array based on a pivot element and then concatenating the partitioned parts. The partitioning is stable, meaning the order of elements in each part remains the same as before partitioning.\n\n    Explanation: The eversion operation is a specific way to rearrange the elements of an array based on a chosen pivot. The goal is to create two subarrays: one with elements less than or equal to the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. The order of elements within each subarray is preserved.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n   ", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())  # Read the length of the array\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the array elements\n\n        count = 0\n        while True:\n            x = a[-1]  # Select the last element as the pivot\n            left = []\n            right = []\n\n            # Partition the array into left and right parts\n            for element in a:\n                if element <= x:\n                    left.append(element)\n                else:\n                    right.append(element)\n\n            # Check if the array has changed\n            if a == left + right:\n                break\n            else:\n                a = left + right\n                count += 1\n\n        results.append(count)\n\n    # Output the results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: "}, "Round_1": {"code": "def main():\n    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())  # Read the length of the array\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the array elements\n\n        count = 0\n        while True:\n            x = a[-1]  # Select the last element as the pivot\n            left = []\n            right = []\n\n            # Partition the array into left and right parts\n            for element in a:\n                if element <= x:\n                    left.append(element)\n                else:\n                    right.append(element)\n\n            # Check if the array has changed\n            if a == left + right:\n                break\n            else:\n                a = left + right\n                count += 1\n\n        results.append(count)\n\n    # Output the results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, false, false, true, false, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 21, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
