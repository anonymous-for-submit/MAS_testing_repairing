{"name": "1618_A. Polycarp and Sums of Subsequences", "description": "Polycarp had an array a of 3 positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array b of 7 integers.\n\nFor example, if a = \\{1, 4, 3\\}, then Polycarp wrote out 1, 4, 3, 1 + 4 = 5, 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8. After sorting, he got an array b = \\{1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}.\n\nUnfortunately, Polycarp lost the array a. He only has the array b left. Help him to restore the array a.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line which contains 7 integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_7 (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9; b_i \u2264 b_{i+1}). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one array a which yields this array b as described in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print 3 integers \u2014 a_1, a_2 and a_3.
