Initially, Mr. Chanek is equipped with a grid of dimensions n \u00d7 m.\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} indicating the direction in which the ball will travel.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will travel to the right (the subsequent cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will travel downward (the following cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will travel to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\nEvery time a ball exits a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will update to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls one after the other, each beginning from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows.

He was given math homework in which he was given an array a of length n and an array of symbols b of length n, consisting of symbols '*' and '/'.\n\nLet's denote a path of calculations for a segment [l; r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) in the following way: \n\n  * Let x=1 initially. For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i, and if b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations (the number of them is exactly r - l + 1). \n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!

Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation. That is to say, the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. The grid is structured in such a way that Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies. If he dies, the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). \n\nThe mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements. This is obtained by dividing the sum by n.\n\nMonocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264

[i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of

removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the

Now he will split the sequence a into one or more consecutive subarrays so that each element of a belongs to exactly one subarray. Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. You need to return a boolean value indicating whether such a split is possible or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. They are not arranged randomly but follow a specific sequence. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. They are not arranged randomly but follow a specific sequence. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s. Your task is to compute the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        keyboard = input()\n        word = input()\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard\n        keyboard_positions = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(keyboard)}\n        \n        # Calculate the total movement time for the word\n        total_time = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(word)):\n            total_time += abs(keyboard_positions[word[i]] -

That is to say, the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts. For example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].

Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Now he will split the sequence a into one or more consecutive subarrays so that each element of a belongs to exactly one subarray. Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You are required to determine whether it can be achieved. It is your task to tell whether it is possible.\n\nThe longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.\n\nAn array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

The grid is structured in such a way that Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if the absolute difference between x_1 and x_2 is not greater than 1. Likewise, the absolute difference between y_1 and y_2 is not greater than 1.\n\nThere are traps in some cells, and if Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies which ends the game.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n. Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the

The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s. Your task is to compute the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard. Assume the sequence is fixed and known before typing begins.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        keyboard = input()\n        word = input()\n        \n        #

Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if the absolute difference between x_1 and x_2 is not greater than 1. Likewise, the absolute difference between y_1 and y_2 is not greater than 1.\n\nThere are traps in some cells, and if Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies which ends the game.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n. Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "completions": ["def can_complete_level(grid, n):\n    # Check if the starting cell (1, 1) and the ending cell (2, n) are safe\n    if grid[0][0] == '1' or grid[1][n-1] == '1':\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Initialize a 2D list to keep track of visited cells\n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n    \n    # Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to check if a path exists\n    queue = [(0, 0)]  # (row, col)\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        row, col = queue.pop(0)\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal (2, n)\n        if row == 1 and col == n -

They are not arranged randomly but follow a specific sequence, with each key corresponding to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard, which also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one, positioning your hand exactly over the corresponding key and pressing it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s by computing the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard. Assume the sequence is fixed and known before typing begins.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        keyboard = input()\n        word = input()\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard\n        keyboard_positions = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(keyboard)}\n        \n        # Calculate the total movement time for the word\n        total_time = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(word)):\n            total_time += abs(keyboard_positions[word[i]] -

Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k

The keys are sequenced in a single line in a particular order. Every key is linked to a distinct lowercase Latin letter.\n\nYou have to type the word s on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.\n\nMoving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nCalculate the time required to type the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

Define S(x, y) for each point (x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y); the squared Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2. To improve the building plan, the project supervisor asks for the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m; help him find the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m < 2000) \u2014 the size of the grid.\n\nThen (n + 1) lines follow, each containing (m + 1) integers a_{i, j} (0 \u2264 a_{i, j} \u2264 1) \u2014 the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane.

Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. The grid is structured in such a way that Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies. If he dies, the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level by navigating around any traps. Consider different configurations of traps to determine the safest path.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "completions": ["def can_complete_level(n, grid):\n    # Check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without falling into a trap\n    # Starting cell (1, 1) is safe, and ending cell (2, n) is safe\n    # We can use a simple BFS to find the shortest path\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # (row, col)\n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the end cell\n        if x == 1 and y == n -

The goal is to find a path from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n) without stepping on any trap ('1').\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n", " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the input for the number of test cases and the details of each level.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Read the first line to get the number of test cases (t).\",\n          \"For each test case, read the next two lines to get the number of columns (n) and the grid details for both rows.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Check if it's possible to navigate from (1, 1) to (2, n) without falling into a trap.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"For each test case, check the grid to identify if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) that avoids traps.\",\n          \"Ensure that the starting cell (1, 1) and the ending cell (2, n) are safe.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Output the result for each test case.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"For each test case, output 'YES' if a path exists, otherwise output 'NO'.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_steps\": [\n      \"Initialize the number of test cases.\",\n      \"Loop through each test case.\",\n      \"Read the number of columns and the grid details for both rows.\",\n      \"Check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) without falling into a trap.\",\n      \"Output the result for each test case.\",\n      \"End the program.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the input for the number of test cases and the details of each level.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Read the first line to get the number of test cases (t).\",\n          \"For each test case, read the next two lines to get the number of columns (n) and the grid details for both rows.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Check if it's possible to navigate from (1, 1) to (", " ```json\n{\n  \"Plan\": {\n    \"Subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"Description\": \"Read the number of test cases.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Description\": \"Read the number of columns for each test case.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the number of columns for each test case.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Description\": \"Read the grid configuration for each test case.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the 2xN grid configuration for each test case.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Description\": \"Check if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n) without passing through any trap cells.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Implement a function to determine if there's a safe path considering the grid's configuration.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"HighLevelPlan\": [\n      {\n        \"Step\": 1,\n        \"Description\": \"Initialize the program to read input from standard input.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Use the input() function to read input.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Step\": 2,\n        \"Description\": \"Read the number of test cases.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the number of test cases.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Step\": 3,\n        \"Description\": \"Iterate through each test case.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Loop through the number of test cases and process each one.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Step\": 4,\n        \"Description\": \"Read the number of columns for the current test case.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the number of columns.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Step\": 5,\n        \"Description\": \"Read the grid configuration for the current test case.\",\n        \"Task\": \"Parse the input to get the 2xN grid configuration.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Step\": 6,\n        \"Description\": \"Check if there's a safe path from (1, 1) to (2, n).\",\n        \"Task\": \"Implement a function to check for a safe path considering the grid's configuration.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'grid': a 2-row, n-column layout where the goal is to find a safe path from (1, 1) to (2, n).\n    Explanation: The grid is a 2xN matrix where each cell can either be safe ('0') or contain a trap ('1').

Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements. Please note that it's possible that k is not an integer. The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n), and Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k. Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the

any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays.\n\nFor example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].\n\nYouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a in such a way that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You are required to determine whether it can be achieved.

He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs, and he wants to distribute all songs into two concerts where every song should be included in exactly one concert. He wants to minimize the absolute difference in the lengths of the concerts as much as he can. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert. It is important to remember that the duration is calculated by adding up the length of each song included.

Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. The grid is structured in such a way that Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it's possible to transition from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies. If he dies, the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level by navigating around any traps. Consider different configurations of traps to determine the safest path.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Let's define the eversion operation where x = a_n, and array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x), maintaining the order of elements in each part as before the operation, so the partition is stable and then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts. For example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays. For example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1].

You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}.

Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays; for example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a so that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.

They are not arranged randomly but follow a specific sequence, with each key corresponding to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard, which also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you have to input all its characters consecutively one after the other, placing your hand precisely over the matching key and pressing it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nCalculate how much time it will require to type the word s by determining the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard. Assume the sequence is fixed and known before typing begins.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        keyboard = input()\n        word = input()\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map each key to its position\n        key_positions = {key: idx for idx, key in enumerate(keyboard)}\n        \n        # Calculate the total movement time for the word\n        total_time = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(word)):\n            total_time += abs(key_positions[word[i]] -

2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^{9}), where a_i is the i-th element of the array.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n8 8 8 8\n3\n50 20 10\n5\n1 4 7 3 5\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n0\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, any pair of elements can be removed since all of them are equal.\n\nIn the second example, there is no way to delete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change.\n\nIn the third example, it is possible to delete the elements on positions 1 and 3, or the elements on positions 4 and 5.", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n        mean = total_sum / n\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                new_sum = total_sum -

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays. For example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a so that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays; for example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a so that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3. An array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. You need to determine the feasibility of achieving a bitwise XOR of 0 for the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of the subarrays formed.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.

Help him to restore the array a.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line which contains 7 integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_7 (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9; b_i \u2264 b_{i+1}). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one array a which yields this array b as described in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print 3 integers \u2014 a_1, a_2 and a_3. If there can be several answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 3 4 4 5 7 8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n300000000 300000000 300000000 600000000 600000000 600000000 900000000\n1 1 2 999999998 999999999 999999999 1000000000\n1 2 2 3 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 4 3\n4 1 2\n300000000 300000000 300000000\n999999998 1 1\n1 2 2\n\nNote\n\nThe subsequence of the array a is a sequence that can be obtained from a by removing zero or more of its elements.\n\nTwo subsequences are considered different if index sets of elements included in them are different.

Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level consists of a rectangular grid with 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "completions": ["def can_complete_level(grid, n):\n    # Check if the starting and goal positions are safe\n    if grid[0][0] == '1' or grid[1][n-1] == '1':\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Use BFS to find a path from (1, 1) to (2, N)\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Directions for moving to adjacent cells by side and/or corner\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(0, 0)])\n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If reached the goal cell (2, N)\n        if y == n -

Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). These are elements which are less than or equal to x. The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation. This means that the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The keys follow a specific sequence. They are not arranged randomly but follow a specific sequence, with each key corresponding to a unique lowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word s on this keyboard, which also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you have to input all its characters consecutively one after the other, placing your hand precisely over the matching key and pressing it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions 8, 5, 12 and 15, respectively. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nCalculate how much time it will require to type the word s by determining the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard. Assume the sequence is fixed and known before typing begins.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74", "completions": ["def main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        keyboard = input()\n        word = input()\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map each letter to its position on the keyboard\n        keyboard_positions = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(keyboard)}\n        \n        # Initialize the total time to 0\n        total_time = 0\n        \n        # Calculate the time to type the word\n        for i in range(1, len(word)):\n            current_pos = keyboard_positions[word[i]]\n            previous_pos = keyboard_positions[word[i -

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays. The lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays are denoted as h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k. For example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a so that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5]. It has length 3. An array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Consider edge cases such as empty arrays or sequences with identical elements when formulating your solution.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.

In this problem, we need to find pairs of indices [i, j] such that deleting the elements at these positions keeps the mean of the remaining elements equal to the original mean.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': means that we need to find pairs where the sum of the remaining elements divided by the count of the remaining elements equals the original", " ```json\n{\n

If there can be several answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 3 4 4 5 7 8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n300000000 300000000 300000000 600000000 600000000 600000000 900000000\n1 1 2 999999998 999999999 999999999 1000000000\n1 2 2 3 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 4 3\n4 1 2\n300000000 300000000 300000000\n999999998 1 1\n1 2 2\n\nNote\n\nThe subsequence of the array a is a sequence that can be obtained from a by removing zero or more of its elements.\n\nTwo subsequences are considered different if index sets of elements included in them are different.

Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level consists of a rectangular grid with 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) \u2014 at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level. Consider edge cases where no movement is possible or all paths are blocked.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "completions": ["def can_complete_level(n, grid):\n    #

You have to type the word s on this keyboard, which also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nTo type a word, you have to input all its characters consecutively one after the other, placing your hand precisely over the matching key and pressing it. Moving the hand between the keys takes time, which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right).\n\nFor example, consider a keyboard where the letters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\".\n\nCalculate how much time it will require to type the word s by determining the total movement time needed to type the given word on the keyboard. Assume the sequence is fixed and known before typing begins.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given

Let k be the number of resulting subarrays, and h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k be the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays. For example, if we split [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1] into [2, 5, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 2, 5], [1], then h = [3, 2, 1]. YouKn0wWho wonders if it is possible to split the sequence a so that the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of h_1, h_2, \u2026, h_k is equal to 0. You have to tell whether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_m is the longest sequence of valid indices. These indices are i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k and b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \u2026 < b_{i_k}. For example, the LIS of [2, 5, 3, 3, 5] is [2, 3, 5], which has length 3.

The goal is to divide the original sequence into subarrays where the LIS lengths have a bitwise XOR of 0.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': This phrase indicates that the number of times an integer appears in the list must be", " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the input for each test case, including the number of test cases and the sequence for each case.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Read the number of test cases (t).\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"For each test case, determine if it is possible to split the sequence into subarrays such that the bitwise XOR of the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of each subarray is 0.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"For each sequence, find all possible ways to split it into subarrays.\",\n          \"For each split, calculate the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences for each subarray.\",\n          \"Calculate the bitwise XOR of these lengths.\",\n          \"Check if the XOR result is 0.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Implement a function to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a given sequence.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Use dynamic programming to find the LIS.\",\n          \"Store the length of the LIS for each subsequence.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Implement a function to calculate the bitwise XOR of a list of numbers.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Iterate through the list and compute the XOR of all elements.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_plan\": [\n      \"Initialize variables to store the results.\",\n      \"Read the number of test cases.\",\n      \"Loop through each test case:\",\n      \"  Read the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.\",\n      \"  Find all possible ways to split the sequence into subarrays.\",\n      \"  For each split, calculate the LIS lengths and the XOR of these lengths.\",\n      \"  Check if the XOR result is 0.\",\n      \"  Store the result for each test case.\",\n      \"Output the results.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the input for each test case, including the number of test cases and the sequence for each case.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Read the number of test cases (t).\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"For each test case, determine if it is possible to split the sequence into subarrays such that the bitwise XOR of the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of each subarray is 0.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n         ", " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Read the input for each test case, including the number of test cases and the sequence for each case.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Read the number of test cases (t).\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"For each test case, determine if it is possible to split the sequence into subarrays such that the bitwise XOR of the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of each subarray is 0.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"For each sequence, find all possible ways to split it into subarrays.\",\n          \"For each split, calculate the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences for each subarray.\",\n          \"Calculate the bitwise XOR of these lengths.\",\n          \"Check if the XOR result is 0.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Implement a function to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a given sequence.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Use dynamic programming to find the LIS.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Implement a function to check if a given sequence can be split into subarrays satisfying the condition.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Iterate through all possible ways to split the sequence.\",\n          \"For each split, use the LIS function to find the lengths of the subsequences.\",\n          \"Calculate the XOR of these lengths and check if it is 0.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_plan\": [\n      \"Initialize the input reader.\",\n      \"Loop through each test case.\",\n      \"For each test case, read the sequence.\",\n      \"Use the function to check all possible splits of the sequence.\",\n      \"If a valid split is found, print 'YES';

Monocarp maneuvers a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 located at the intersection of the first row and the first column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. Needless to say, going outside the grid is not allowed.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo pass a level, Monocarp's character needs to reach cell (2, n) \u2014 situated at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp ascertain whether it is feasible to finish the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level.

The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case,

Now he is keen to finish the first level of this game.\n\nA level consists of a rectangular grid measuring 2 rows by n columns. Monocarp maneuvers a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 located at the intersection of the first row and the first column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. It is important to note that going outside the grid is not allowed. Such an action would violate the constraints of the game.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo pass a level, Monocarp's character needs to reach cell (2, n) \u2014 situated at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp ascertain whether it is feasible to finish the level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case,

Now he is keen to finish the first level of this game.\n\nA level consists of a rectangular grid measuring 2 rows by n columns. Monocarp maneuvers a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) \u2014 located at the intersection of the first row and the first column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \u2264 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \u2264 1. It is important to note that going outside the grid is not allowed. Such an action would violate the constraints of the game.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo pass a level, Monocarp's character needs to reach cell (2, n) \u2014 situated at the intersection of row 2 and column n.\n\nHelp Monocarp ascertain whether it is feasible to finish the level. Consider designing an algorithm that systematically evaluates available paths while avoiding traps to determine if reaching the end cell is possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3).\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4).\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 6).", "completions": ["def can_complete_level(grid, n):\n    # Check if the starting and ending cells are safe\n    if grid[0][0] == '1' or grid[1][n-1] == '1':\n        return 'NO'\n    \n    # Check if it's possible to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) avoiding traps\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[0][i] == '1' and grid[1][i] == '1':\n            return 'NO'\n    return 'YES'\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]\n        results.append(can_complete_level(grid, n))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\nmain()", "def can_complete_level(grid, n):\n    # Check if the starting and ending positions are safe\n    if grid[0][0] == '1' or grid[1][n-1] == '1':\n        return 'NO'\n    \n    # Use BFS to check if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, N)\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n    queue = deque([(0, 0), (1, 0)])\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    visited[1][0] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the end\n        if y == n -
