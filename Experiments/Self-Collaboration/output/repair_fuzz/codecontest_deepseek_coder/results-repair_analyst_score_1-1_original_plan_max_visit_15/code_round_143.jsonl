{"name": "1591_B. Array Eversion", "description": "You are given an array a of length n.\n\nLet's define the eversion operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\u2264 x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.\n\nFor example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWe start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops changing.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5\n2 4 1 5 3\n5\n5 3 2 4 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nNote\n\nConsider the fist example.\n\n  * The first eversion: a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3], x = 3. [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. \n  * The second and following eversions: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], x = 5. [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the second example. \n\n  * The first eversion: a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1], x = 1. [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]. \n  * The second eversion: a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], x = 4. [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. \n  * The third and following eversions: a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], x = 5. [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. This eversion does not change the array, so the answer is 2.

This process is repeated until the array no longer changes.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'more than': Indicates that the pivot element must appear more times in the array than its value.\n    Explanation: For example, if the pivot element is 3, it must appear", "Round_0": {"code": "def perform_eversions(arr):\n    while True:\n        original = arr.copy()\n        pivot = arr[-1]\n        left = []\n        right = []\n        for num in arr[:-1]:\n            if num <= pivot:\n                left.append(num)\n            else:\n                right.append(num)\n        arr = left + [pivot] + right\n        if arr == original:\n            break\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        final_arr = perform_eversions(arr)\n        k = 0\n        while final_arr != arr:\n            arr = final_arr\n            final_arr = perform_eversions(arr)\n            k += 1\n        results.append(k)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": " ```json\n{\n  \"Decomposition\": {\n    \"Subproblems\": [\n      \"Read the number of test cases and the details of each test case from standard input.\",\n      \"For each test case, read the array of integers.\",\n      \"Perform eversion operations on the array until it stops changing.\",\n      \"Count the number of eversion operations performed.\",\n      \"Output the count for each test case.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"High-Level Plan\": {\n    \"Steps\": [\n      \"Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of eversion operations.\",\n      \"Loop through each test case.\",\n      \"For each test case, read the array length and the array elements.\",\n      \"Perform eversion operations on the array until it stops changing.\",\n      \"Increment the counter each time an eversion operation is performed.\",\n      \"Output the counter value for the current test case.\",\n      \"Repeat for all test cases.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'eversion operation': This involves partitioning an array into two parts based on a pivot value, then concatenating those parts back together in a different order. The process is repeated until the array no longer changes.\n    Explanation: The eversion operation rearranges the elements of the array based on a chosen pivot, and this process is repeated until the array reaches a stable state where no further changes occur.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The", "Round_0": {"code": "def perform_eversions(arr):\n    while True:\n        original = arr.copy()\n        pivot = arr[-1]\n        left = []\n        right = []\n        for num in arr[:-1]:\n            if num <= pivot:\n                left.append(num)\n            else:\n                right.append(num)\n        arr = left + [pivot] + right\n        if arr == original:\n            break\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input())\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        final_arr = perform_eversions(arr)\n        k = 0\n        while final_arr != arr:\n            arr = final_arr\n            final_arr = perform_eversions(arr)\n            k += 1\n        results.append(k)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, false, true, false, false, true, true, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 143, "examples": "\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
