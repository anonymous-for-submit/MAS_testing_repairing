'differ at one bit position only'\n    Explanation: This means that the two numbers have only one differing bit position in their binary representation.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The major steps should be implemented step by step as they are sequential and do not require simultaneous execution.\n\n# [edge case] \n    differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(0, 1) == True\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 0 is '0' and 1 is '1'. They differ at the first bit position, so the expected output is True.\n    differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(5, 9) == False\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is '101' and 9 is '1001'. They differ at more than one bit position, so the expected output is False.\n    differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(7, 7) == False\n    Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is '111' and 7 is '111'. They are identical in all bit positions, so the expected output is False.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
