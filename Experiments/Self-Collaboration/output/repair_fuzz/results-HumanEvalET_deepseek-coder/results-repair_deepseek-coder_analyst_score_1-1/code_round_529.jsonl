There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. You can exchange a large number of elements between lst1 and lst2. You have the freedom to exchange as many elements as needed between the two lists. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be

There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. You can exchange a large number of elements between lst1 and lst2. You have the freedom to exchange as many elements as needed between the two lists. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return the appropriate message.'''\n    \n    # Identify the even numbers in lst1 and the odd numbers in lst2\n    even_in_lst1 = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 == 0]\n    odd_in_lst2 = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 != 0]\n    \n    # Check the feasibility of making all elements in lst1 even\n    if len(odd_in_lst2) < len(lst1) - len(even_in_lst1):\n        return \"It is not possible to make all elements in lst1 even.\"\n    \n    # Perform the element exchange to achieve the goal\n    for odd in odd_in_lst2:\n        if len(even_in_lst1) < len(lst1):\n            lst1.remove(next(num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0))\n            lst2.append(odd)\n            even_in_lst1.append(odd)\n    \n    # Verify the result\n    if all(num % 2 == 0 for num in lst1):\n        return \"Success: All elements in lst1 are now even.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Failed to make all elements in lst1 even.\"", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "pass_results": [false, true, false, false, true, false, false, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [0, 133, 0, 0, 133, 0, 0, 0, 133, 0], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 529, "mutate_method": "expand_one2two", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 274}
