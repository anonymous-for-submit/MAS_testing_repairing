Description:
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns its length. The function should be able to handle any string of ASCII characters and return an integer representing the number of characters in the string. Make sure to consider edge cases like an empty string or a very long string. Provide any necessary error handling for non-string inputs. Be sure to optimize the function for performance, considering time and space complexity. The solution should accommodate both simple and complex input scenarios. 

Examples:
1. input: "hello" 
   output: 5

2. input: "" 
   output: 0

3. input: "longestwordinhistory" 
   output: 20

Constraints:
- The input string may consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.
- The function should handle strings with a length up to 10,000 characters efficiently.
- The function should return 0 for an empty string.

Additional Notes:
Consider implementing the function in a way that can easily be extended to handle Unicode strings in the future.

'''We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The numbers in the array will be in a random order. Your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index.

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.
For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.

## Description

You are given a list of strings and a target substring. Your task is to filter out and return a list containing only those strings that include the specified substring. Write a function that takes in two parameters: a list of strings and a target substring, and returns a new list with only the strings containing the target substring. The input list may contain empty strings, and all operations should be case-sensitive.

The function signature might look like this:

```python
def filter_strings_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    pass
```

### Example

```python
input_list = ["apple", "banana", "apricot", "cherry", "pineapple"]
substring = "app"
output = filter_strings_by_substring(input_list, substring)  
# Output should be ["apple", "apricot", "pineapple"]
```

### Constraints

1. All strings in the list will contain only alphabets.
2. The function should be case-sensitive.
3. The length of the input list will be at most 10^4.
4. The substring to search for will be non-empty and consist of alphabetic characters only.

**Note**: Performance should be considered since the input list can be large.
>>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')

You are given a list of strings and a target substring. Your task is to filter out and return a list containing only those strings that include the specified substring. Write a function that takes in two parameters: a list of strings and a target substring, and returns a new list with only the strings containing the target substring. The input list may contain empty strings, and all operations should be case-sensitive.

The function signature might look like this:

```python
def filter_strings_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    pass
```

### Example

```python
input_list = ["apple", "banana", "apricot", "cherry", "pineapple"]
substring = "app"
output = filter_strings_by_substring(input_list, substring)  
# Output should be ["apple", "apricot", "pineapple"]
```

### Constraints

1. All strings in the list will contain only alphabets.
2. The function should be case-sensitive.
3. The length of the input list will be at most 10^4.
4. The substring to search for will be non-empty and consist of alphabetic characters only.

**Note**: Performance should be considered since the input list can be large.
