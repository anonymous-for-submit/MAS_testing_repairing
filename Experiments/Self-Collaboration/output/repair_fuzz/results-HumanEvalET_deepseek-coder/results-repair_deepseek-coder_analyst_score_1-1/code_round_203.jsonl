There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. You can exchange as many elements as needed between the two lists. However, ensure that all elements in lst1 become even as a result of these exchanges. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be
