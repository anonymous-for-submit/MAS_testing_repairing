{"task_id": "HumanEval/123", "prompt": "def get_odd_collatz(n):\t\n'''Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is [1]. 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\nFor example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1,

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, and each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.'''\n    \n    sequence = [n]\n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            n = 3 * n + 1\n        sequence.append(n)\n    \n    odd_numbers = [num for num in sequence if num % 2 != 0]\n    return sorted(odd_numbers)", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": " ```json\n{\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"subproblems\": [\n      {\n        \"subproblem\": \"Identify the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Start with the given positive integer n.\",\n          \"Apply the Collatz sequence rules to generate the sequence.\",\n          \"Filter out the odd numbers from the generated sequence.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"subproblem\": \"Sort the list of odd numbers obtained from the Collatz sequence.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Collect the odd numbers from the Collatz sequence.\",\n          \"Sort the list of odd numbers in ascending order.\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"subproblem\": \"Implement the function get_odd_collatz(n) to return the sorted list of odd numbers.\",\n        \"steps\": [\n          \"Combine the steps to identify and sort the odd numbers.\",\n          \"Return the sorted list of odd numbers as the output of the function.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high_level_plan\": [\n      \"Understand the Collatz sequence and its properties.\",\n      \"Identify the odd numbers in the sequence for the given input n.\",\n      \"Sort the identified odd numbers.\",\n      \"Implement the function get_odd_collatz(n) to perform the above steps and return the sorted list of odd numbers.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'Collatz sequence': This is a sequence of numbers where each number is obtained by following the rules: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
