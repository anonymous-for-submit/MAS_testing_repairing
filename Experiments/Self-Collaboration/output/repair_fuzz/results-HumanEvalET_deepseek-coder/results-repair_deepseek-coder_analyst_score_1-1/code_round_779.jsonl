There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    For example:\n        exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 5]) should return \"YES\" because we can swap the 1 in lst1 with the 2 in lst2 to make lst1 = [2, 2, 3, 4].\n        exchange([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]) should return \"YES\" because we can swap the 1 in lst1 with the 2 in lst2 to make lst1 = [2, 3, 5, 6].\n        exchange([1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5]) should return \"NO\" because there are no even numbers to swap.\n    '''\n    # Identify the elements in lst1 that are odd\n    odd_in_lst1 = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]\n    \n    # Check lst2 for even numbers\n    even_in_lst2 = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Attempt to exchange odd numbers from lst1 with even numbers from lst2\n    if len(odd_in_lst1) <= len(even_in_lst2):\n        # Perform the exchange\n        for odd in odd_in_lst1:\n            if even_in_lst2:\n                lst1[lst1.index(odd)] = even_in_lst2.pop(0)\n    \n    # Confirm if lst1 is composed of only even numbers\n    if all(num % 2 == 0 for num in lst1):\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [1.0, 1.0, 0.4586, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [133, 133, 61, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133, 133], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 779, "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 411}
