{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and the goal is to determine the starting position that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off the grid.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible commands': The goal is to find the starting position that allows the robot to execute the highest number of commands without breaking. This means we need to track and compare the number of commands executed from different starting positions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the starting position that allows the robot to execute the greatest number of commands. In code, this would involve keeping track of the count of executed commands and updating the maximum count as needed.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to simulating the robot's movement and checking if it falls off the board should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the simulation of the robot's movement and the check for boundary conditions should be done in a single loop for each starting position.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 1\n    L = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 1x1 board, any move will cause the robot to fall off, so the starting position is irrelevant, and the robot cannot execute any commands successfully.\n\n    2 2\n    RR = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 2x2 board, starting from (1,1), the robot can execute the first 'R' command but will fall off on the second 'R'. The starting position (1,1) allows the maximum number of commands (1) to be executed.\n\n    3 3\n    UUU = 3 1\n    Explanation: On a 3x3 board, starting from (3,1), the robot can execute all 'U' commands without falling off, ending at (1,1). This starting position allows all commands to be executed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the board size is minimal (1x1) or where the command sequence is such that any starting position results in immediate failure. This can be handled by checking the board size and command sequence length before simulating movements.\n    \n    ```python\n    if n == 1 and m == 1:\n        print(1,", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        # Initialize variables to track the best starting position\n        max_commands = 0\n        best_start = (1, 1)\n        \n        # Try all possible starting positions\n        for start_row in range(1, n + 1):\n            for start_col in range(1, m + 1):\n                row, col = start_row, start_col\n                commands_executed = 0\n                \n                for command in s:\n                    if command == 'L':\n                        col -= 1\n                    elif command == 'R':\n                        col += 1\n                    elif command == 'U':\n                        row -= 1\n                    elif command == 'D':\n                        row += 1\n                    \n                    # Check if the robot falls off the board\n                    if row < 1 or row > n or col < 1 or col > m:\n                        break\n                    commands_executed += 1\n                \n                # Update the best starting position if this one is better\n                if commands_executed > max_commands:\n                    max_commands = commands_executed\n                    best_start = (start_row, start_col)\n        \n        results.append(f\"{best_start[0]} {best_start[1]}\")\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, "session_historys": [{"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases, board dimensions, and command sequences.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"Read the integer t representing the number of test cases.\",\n        \"For each test case, read integers n and m representing the board dimensions.\",\n        \"Read the string s representing the sequence of commands.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Simulate the robot's movement on the board for each test case to determine the optimal starting position.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"Initialize variables to track the maximum number of commands executed and the corresponding starting position.\",\n        \"Iterate over all possible starting positions on the board.\",\n        \"For each starting position, simulate the robot's movement according to the command sequence.\",\n        \"Check if the robot falls off the board during the simulation.\",\n        \"If the robot successfully executes more commands than previously recorded, update the maximum commands and starting position.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Output the optimal starting position for each test case.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"For each test case, print the row and column of the optimal starting position.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases, board dimensions, and command sequences.\",\n    \"For each test case, iterate over all possible starting positions on the board.\",\n    \"Simulate the robot's movement from each starting position and track the number of successfully executed commands.\",\n    \"Determine the starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed without the robot falling off the board.\",\n    \"Output the optimal starting position for each test case.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'checkered rectangular board'\n    Explanation: This refers to the grid-like structure of the board where the robot can move.

The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and the goal is to find the starting position that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off the board.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible commands': This means we need to find the starting position that allows the robot to execute the highest number of commands without breaking. In code, this involves iterating over possible starting positions and tracking the number of commands executed.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': This indicates that we need to find the starting position that results in the highest number of commands executed. In code, this can be implemented by maintaining a variable to track the maximum number of commands executed and updating it whenever a new maximum is found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented in a nested manner. Specifically, for each test case, the simulation of the robot's movement should be done for each possible starting position. This involves iterating over all possible starting positions and simulating the robot's movement for each one.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 1\n    L\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 1x1 board, any movement will cause the robot to fall off, so the starting position is the only cell available.\n\n    2 2\n    RR\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: On a 2x2 board, starting from (1,1) allows the robot to execute the first command 'R' without falling off, but the second 'R' will cause it to fall.\n\n    3 3\n    UUU\n    = 3 1\n    Explanation: Starting from the bottom row (3,1) allows the robot to execute all 'U' commands without falling off.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the board size is minimal (1x1) or where the command sequence is such that any starting position results in immediate failure.

The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2", "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on.
