{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The core concept is understanding how the ball moves based on the grid's direction values and how these values change as the ball passes through.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'n \u00d7 m': This indicates the size of the grid, with n rows and m columns.\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This specifies that the starting column for each ball is within the grid's column range.\n    Implementation: These constraints ensure that the grid and ball positions are valid and should be checked in the code to prevent out-of-bounds errors.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the ball movement and updating the grid should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Simulate the movement of each ball through the grid\" and \"Update the direction of each cell to '2' after the ball leaves it\" should be done in the same loop to ensure the grid is updated correctly as the ball moves.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Grid with only one row (e.g., 1 3): The ball should exit immediately based on the initial direction.\n       Example: Input: 1 2 1, Grid: [1, 3], Ball position: 1\n       Output: 2\n       Explanation: The ball moves right and exits the grid.\n       \n    2. Grid with only one column (e.g., 2): The ball should move down until it exits.\n       Example: Input: 3 1 1, Grid: [2, 2, 2], Ball position: 1\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: The ball moves down and exits the grid.\n       \n    3. Ball starts at a boundary and reflects: The ball should change direction upon hitting a boundary.\n       Example: Input: 2 3 1, Grid: [1, 3, 3], [2, 2, 2], Ball position: 3\n       Output: 2\n       Explanation: The ball moves left, reflects off the boundary, and exits.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, particularly for boundary reflections and single-row/column grids.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases", "Round_0": {"code": "def dropping_balls():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    \n    # Read n, m, k\n    n = int(data[index])\n    m = int(data[index + 1])\n    k = int(data[index + 2])\n    index += 3\n    \n    # Read the grid\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append([int(data[index + j]) for j in range(m)])\n        index += m\n    \n    # Read the initial column positions for the balls\n    ball_positions = [int(data[index + i]) -

Implement an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The balls may reflect off the boundaries of the grid, altering their path. For each ball, track its entire movement until it finally exits the grid.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows.
