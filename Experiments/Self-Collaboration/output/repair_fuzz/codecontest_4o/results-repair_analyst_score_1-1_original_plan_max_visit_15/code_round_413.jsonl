{"name": "1600_F. Party Organization", "description": "On the great island of Baltia, there live N people, numbered from 1 to N. There are exactly M pairs of people that are friends with each other. The people of Baltia want to organize a successful party, but they have very strict rules on what a party is and when the party is successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i. Two friends can not be in the list of friends twice (no pairs are repeated) and a person can be friends with themselves (U_i \u2260 V_i).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to organize a successful party, print 5 numbers indicating which 5 people should be invited to the party. If it's not possible to organize a successful party, print -1 instead. If there are multiple successful parties possible, print any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6 3\n1 4\n4 2\n5 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 3 5 6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1",

This can be implemented using a graph traversal algorithm to check both conditions in one pass through the graph.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Input: 5 0\n       Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n       Explanation: With 0 friendships, any group of 5 people forms an independent set.\n    2. Input: 5 10\n       Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n       Explanation: With all possible friendships (10 for 5 people), any group of 5 people forms a clique.\n    3. Input: 6 15\n       Output: -1\n       Explanation: If every possible pair among 6 people is a friendship, no group of 5 can be an independent set, and if the friendships are not distributed to form a clique, it's impossible to have a successful party.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should include logic to:\n    - Check for a complete graph of 5 nodes (clique).\n    - Check for a complete absence of edges among 5 nodes (independent set).\n    - Efficiently handle large inputs using graph traversal techniques like DFS or BFS to find cliques or independent sets.\n\n```python\ndef find_successful_party(N, M, friendships):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    #

This can be implemented using a graph traversal algorithm to check both conditions in one pass through the graph.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1.

Input: 6 15\n       Output: -1\n       Explanation: If every possible pair among 6 people is a friendship, no group of 5 can be an independent set, and if the friendships are not distributed to form a clique, it's impossible to have a successful party.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should include logic to:\n    - Check for a complete graph of 5 nodes (clique).\n    - Check for a complete absence of edges among 5 nodes (independent set).\n    - Efficiently handle large inputs using graph traversal techniques like DFS or BFS to find cliques or independent sets.\n\n```python\ndef find_successful_party(N, M, friendships):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create adjacency list\n    graph = defaultdict(set)\n    for u, v in friendships:\n        graph[u].add(v)\n        graph[v].add(u)\n\n    # Check for a clique of 5\n    def is_clique(group):\n        for i in range(len(group)):\n            for j", "Round_0": {"code": "def find_successful_party(N, M, friendships):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Parse input\n    index = 0\n    N = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    M = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    friendships = []\n    for _ in range(M):\n        u = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        v = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        friendships.append((u, v))\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    graph = defaultdict(set)\n    for u, v in friendships:\n        graph[u].add(v)\n        graph[v].add(u)\n    \n    # Check for a clique of 5\n    def is_clique(group):\n        for i in range(len(group)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(group)):\n                if group[j] not in graph[group[i]]:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Check for an independent set of 5\n    def is_independent_set(group):\n        for i in range(len(group)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(group)):\n                if group[j] in graph[group[i]]:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Try to find a successful party\n    if N >= 5:\n        # Check for independent set\n        if M == 0:\n            print(\"1 2 3 4 5\")\n            return\n        \n        # Check for clique\n        if M >= 10:\n            print(\"1 2 3 4 5\")\n            return\n        \n        # Check combinations of 5 people\n        from itertools import combinations\n        people = list(range(1, N + 1))\n        for group in combinations(people, 5):\n            if is_clique(group) or is_independent_set(group):\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, group)))\n                return\n    \n    # If no successful party is found\n    print(-1)\n\n# Example usage:\n# The function will be called with input from standard input\n# find_successful_party(N, M, friendships)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: find_successful_party() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'N', 'M', and 'friendships'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def find_successful_party():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    from itertools import combinations\n\n    # Read input\n    data = input().split()\n    index = 0\n    N = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    M = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n\n    friendships = []\n    for _ in range(M):\n        u = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        v = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        friendships.append((u, v))\n\n    # Create adjacency list\n    graph = defaultdict(set)\n    for u, v in friendships:\n        graph[u].add(v)\n        graph[v].add(u)\n\n    # Check for a clique of 5\n    def is_clique(group):\n        for i in range(len(group)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(group)):\n                if group[j] not in graph[group[i]]:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    # Check for an independent set of 5\n    def is_independent_set(group):\n        for i in range(len(group)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(group)):\n                if group[j] in graph[group[i]]:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    # Try to find a successful party\n    if N >= 5:\n        # Check for independent set\n        if M == 0:\n            print(\"1 2 3 4 5\")\n            return\n\n        # Check for clique\n        if M >= 10:\n            print(\"1 2 3 4 5\")\n            return\n\n        # Check combinations of 5 people\n        people = list(range(1, N + 1))\n        for group in combinations(people, 5):\n            if is_clique(group) or is_independent_set(group):\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, group)))\n                return\n\n    # If no successful party is found\n    print(-1)\n\n# The function will be called with input from standard input\nfind_successful_party()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, false, true, true, false, true, false, true, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 7, "round": 413, "prompt": "On the great island of Baltia, there live N people, numbered from 1 to N.
