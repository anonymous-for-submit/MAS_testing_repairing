{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The growth rules are specific and need to be implemented accurately.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': This indicates a sequence of two consecutive days. In code, this can be checked using a loop to compare the current day and the previous day.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This means the flower's height increases by 1 unit if watered on a single day.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This means the flower's height increases by 5 units if watered on two consecutive days.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'final height': This refers to the height of the flower after all days have been processed. It is the result of the simulation.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to checking if the flower is watered and updating the height should be implemented simultaneously within the loop iterating over the days. Specifically:\n    - \"If the flower is watered on the current day (a_i = 1):\"\n    - \"Check if it was also watered the previous day (a_(i-1) = 1) and increase height by 5 centimeters.\"\n    - \"Otherwise, increase height by 1 centimeter.\"\n    - \"If the flower is not watered on the current day (a_i = 0):\"\n    - \"Check if it was also not watered the previous day (a_(i-1) = 0) and set height to 0 (flower dies).\"\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: n = 1, a = [0] => Output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive days of not being watered to die.\n\n    Case 2: n = 2, a = [0, 0] => Output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Case 3: n = 3, a = [1, 1, 0] => Output: 6\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the first two days and does not grow on the third day, but it doesn't die.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
