{"name": "1582_A. Luntik and Concerts", "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.\n\nHe wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.\n\nPlease help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of one-minute, two-minute and three-minute songs.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Luntik can include a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a three-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal to 0.\n\nIn the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, the duration of the second concert will be 6. The difference of them is |7-6| = 1.", "tags": ["math"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1582, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n1 1 1\n2 1 3\n5 5 5\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["0\n1\n0\n1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input":

The dynamic programming approach to explore possible distributions and calculate the absolute difference should be done in one code block to efficiently track and update the minimal difference.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1 0 0 = 1\n    Explanation: With only one one-minute song, the best distribution is one concert with the song and the other empty, resulting in a difference of 1.\n    \n    0 0 0 = 0\n    Explanation: No songs to distribute, so the difference is 0.\n    \n    1 1 1 = 0\n    Explanation: Distribute one one-minute and one two-minute song in one concert and the three-minute song in the other, resulting in a difference of 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the number of songs is extremely unbalanced or zero.\n    ```python\n    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:\n        return 0\n    if a + b + c == 1:\n        return max(a, b, c)\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        \n        # If total duration is odd, the minimal difference is 1\n        if total_duration % 2 != 0:\n            results.append(1)\n            continue\n        \n        # If total duration is even, we need to check if we can split it evenly\n        half_duration = total_duration // 2\n        dp = [False] * (half_duration + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        # Dynamic programming to check if we can reach half_duration\n        for count, duration in [(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)]:\n            for _ in range(count):\n                for j in range(half_duration, duration - 1, -1):\n                    if dp[j - duration]:\n                        dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Find the closest possible sum to half_duration\n        for i in range(half_duration, -1, -1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                closest_sum = i\n                break\n        \n        # Calculate the minimal difference\n        difference = abs(total_duration - 2 * closest_sum)\n        results.append(difference)\n    \n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimal_difference(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: timed out"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def minimal_difference(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        total_duration = a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3\n        \n        # If total duration is odd, the minimal difference is 1\n        if total_duration % 2 != 0:\n            results.append(1)\n            continue\n        \n        # If total duration is even, we need to check if we can split it evenly\n        half_duration = total_duration // 2\n        dp = [False] * (half_duration + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        # Dynamic programming to check if we can reach half_duration\n        for count, duration in [(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)]:\n            for _ in range(count):\n                for j in range(half_duration, duration - 1, -1):\n                    if dp[j - duration]:\n                        dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Find the closest possible sum to half_duration\n        for i in range(half_duration, -1, -1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                closest_sum = i\n                break\n        \n        # Calculate the minimal difference\n        difference = abs(total_duration - 2 * closest_sum)\n        results.append(difference)\n    \n    return results\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        c = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimal_difference(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 597, "prompt": "Luntik has decided to try singing.
