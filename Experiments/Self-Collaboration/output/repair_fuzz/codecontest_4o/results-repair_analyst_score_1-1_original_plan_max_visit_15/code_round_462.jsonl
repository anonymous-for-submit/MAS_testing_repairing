{"name": "1594_B. Special Numbers", "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.\n\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 10^9+7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3 4\n2 12\n105 564\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n12\n3595374\n\nNote\n\nFor n = 3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]", "tags": ["bitmasks", "math"], "difficulty": 8, "id":

For example, for n = 4, the number 17 is special because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'k-th': Refers to the position of the special number in the sequence when arranged in ascending order. The task is to find the k-th special number for given n.\n    Implementation: This requires generating the sequence of special numbers and selecting the k-th element.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'ascending order': Indicates that the sequence of special numbers should be sorted from smallest to largest.\n    Implementation: Ensure the sequence is sorted before selecting the k-th element.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Generate special numbers for each base n\" and \"Find the k-th special number\" should be considered simultaneously.\n    Explanation: While generating the sequence, we can directly keep track of the k-th special number without generating the entire sequence, optimizing the process.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge cases are primarily related to the limits of n and k:\n    1. n = 2, k = 1: The smallest possible values for n and k. Expected output is 1, as the first special number for n = 2 is 2^0 = 1.\n    2. n = 10^9, k = 1: The largest possible value for n with the smallest k. Expected output is 1, as the first special number for any n is n^0 = 1.\n    3. n = 2, k = 10^9: The smallest n with the largest k. Expected output is a large number modulo 10^9+7, requiring efficient computation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases efficiently, especially for large values of n and k.\n    Code for handling large k efficiently:\n    ```python\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    def find_kth_special(n, k):\n        special_number = 0\n        power = 1\n        while k > 0:\n            if k % 2 == 1:\n                special_number = (special_number + power) % MOD\n            power = (", "Round_0": {"code": "MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef find_kth_special(n, k):\n    special_number = 0\n    power = 1\n    while k > 0:\n        if k % 2 == 1:\n            special_number = (special_number + power) % MOD\n        power = (power * n) % MOD\n        k //= 2\n    return special_number\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        k = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = find_kth_special(n, k)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 462, "prompt": "Theofanis has a big interest in sequences of positive integers, so his instructor (Yeltsa Kcir) assigned him a task.
