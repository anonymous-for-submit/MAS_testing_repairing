{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the smallest number of operations needed to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this can be implemented by keeping track of the lowest operation count found.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan are mostly sequential, but the calculation of operations needed for each sub-rectangle (subproblem 3) and determining the minimum number of operations (subproblem 4) can be considered together. This is because as you calculate the operations for each sub-rectangle, you can simultaneously update the minimum operation count.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1.
