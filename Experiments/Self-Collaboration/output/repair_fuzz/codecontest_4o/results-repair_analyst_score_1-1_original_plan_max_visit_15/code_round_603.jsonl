{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive elements in the list are 0.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This indicates the flower grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 1 when a 1 is encountered.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This indicates the flower grows by 5 cm if watered on two consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 5 when two consecutive 1s are encountered.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the growth of the flower should be implemented simultaneously:\n    - Initialize the flower's height to 1 cm.\n    - Iterate over the days and update the flower's height based on the watering rules.\n    - Check if the flower dies (i.e., not watered for two consecutive days) and set the height to -1 if it does.\n    This can be done in a single loop iterating over the list of days.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the first day, but it does not die because it is only one day.\n    \n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n    \n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 1 1 0 1\n    Expected output: 7\n    Explanation: The flower grows by 5 cm on the second day (two consecutive days of watering), does not grow on the third day, and grows by 1 cm on the fourth day.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
