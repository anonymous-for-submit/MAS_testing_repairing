{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The growth rules are specific and depend on consecutive watering days.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two days in a row': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies.\n    Implementation: Check for two consecutive zeros in the input list.\n    \n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment height by 1 if the current day is watered and the previous day wasn't.\n    \n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm.\n    Implementation: Increment height by 5 if both the current and previous days are watered.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for checking if the flower is watered and updating the height should be implemented simultaneously within the loop iterating over the days. Specifically, the logic for checking consecutive watering days and updating the height should be in the same block to ensure correct growth calculation.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 1\n           0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive days of not being watered to die.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 2\n           0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 3\n           1 1 0\n    Expected output: 7\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days (grows by 5 cm on the second day) and not watered on the third day, so it doesn't die.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
