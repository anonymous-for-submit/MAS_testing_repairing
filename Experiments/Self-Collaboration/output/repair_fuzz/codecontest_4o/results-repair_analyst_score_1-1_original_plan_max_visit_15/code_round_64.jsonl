{"name": "1579_B. Shifting Sort", "description": "The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2. The segment a[1 \u2026 5] is then selected and is shifted to the left by 3: [\\color{blue}{2, 4, 5, 1, 3}] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}] \n  3. After that the segment a[1 \u2026 2] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{1, 3}, 2, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{3, 1}, 2, 4, 5] \n  4. And in the end the segment a[1 \u2026 3] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{3, 1, 2}, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 2, 3}, 4, 5] ", "tags": ["implementation",

Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment, then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with its cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d.

This means that the solution must be efficient enough to sort the array within n operations.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to parsing input and performing cyclic shifts should be implemented simultaneously in a loop for each test case. Specifically, the steps to identify unsorted segments, determine l, r, and d, and perform the cyclic shift should be part of a single iterative process until the array is sorted or the maximum number of shifts is reached.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: An already sorted array\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: Since the array is already sorted, no cyclic shifts are needed.\n\n    Edge Case 2: An array with all identical elements\n    Input: [3, 3, 3, 3]\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: All elements are the same, so the array is inherently sorted.\n\n    Edge Case 3: An array with the maximum number of elements (n = 50) in reverse order\n    Input: [50, 49, ..., 1]\n    Expected Output: A sequence of shifts that sorts the array, with k \u2264 50\n    Explanation: The array is in reverse order, requiring multiple shifts to sort, but the number of shifts must not exceed 50.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element, but instead allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment, then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with its cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. For example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8], which is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, resulting in a segment [8, 3, 2] that takes the place of the original elements of the segment, ending with a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].
