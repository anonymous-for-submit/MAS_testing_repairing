{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

Each cell is a potential starting point for the robot.\n    'commands': These are the instructions ('L', 'R', 'D', 'U') that dictate the robot's movement direction.\n    'falling off the board': This means the robot moves beyond the boundaries of the board, which should be avoided.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible': This means maximizing the number of commands executed without the robot falling off the board.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially. However, the simulation of the robot's movement for each starting position can be optimized by considering boundary checks simultaneously within the movement logic. This can be done using a loop to iterate over the command sequence and checking boundary conditions within the same loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with a 1x1 board and a command 'L' = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: The robot cannot move anywhere without falling off, so the starting position is the only cell available.\n    Test case with a 1x2 board and a command 'L' = (1, 2)\n    Explanation: Starting at (1, 2) allows the robot to execute the 'L' command without falling off.\n    Test case with a 3x3 board and a command 'RRDLUU' = (2, 1)\n    Explanation: Starting at (2, 1) allows the robot to execute all commands successfully.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases efficiently by checking boundary conditions during the simulation.\n        def simulate_robot(n, m, commands):\n            max_commands = 0\n            best_start = (1, 1)\n            for r in range(1, n+1):\n                for c in range(1, m+1):\n                    current_r, current_c = r, c\n                    executed_commands = 0\n                    for command in commands:\n                        if command == 'L':\n                            current_c -= 1\n                        elif command == 'R':\n                            current_c += 1\n                        elif command == 'U':\n                            current_r -= 1\n                        elif command == 'D':\n                            current_r += 1\n                        if current_r < 1 or current", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        s = data[index + 2]\n        index += 3\n        \n        # Initialize variables to track the best starting position\n        max_commands = 0\n        best_start = (1, 1)\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible starting positions\n        for start_r in range(1, n + 1):\n            for start_c in range(1, m + 1):\n                current_r, current_c = start_r, start_c\n                executed_commands = 0\n                \n                # Simulate the robot's movement\n                for command in s:\n                    if command == 'L':\n                        current_c -= 1\n                    elif command == 'R':\n                        current_c += 1\n                    elif command == 'U':\n                        current_r -= 1\n                    elif command == 'D':\n                        current_r += 1\n                    \n                    # Check if the robot falls off the board\n                    if current_r < 1 or current_r > n or current_c < 1 or current_c > m:\n                        break\n                    executed_commands += 1\n                \n                # Update the best starting position if more commands are executed\n                if executed_commands > max_commands:\n                    max_commands = executed_commands\n                    best_start = (start_r, start_c)\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(f\"{best_start[0]} {best_start[1]}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, true, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 379, "prompt": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U'. These symbol commands are responsible for triggering movement to the left, right, down, or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board.
