{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

A 'crewmate' is a player who is genuinely part of the team and is working towards the team's goals. The comments in the input describe relationships between players, indicating whether one player considers another to be an imposter or a crewmate.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the goal is to find the highest number of imposters that can be identified without contradictions in the comments. In code, this involves calculating the maximum number of imposters in a valid configuration of players.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the largest possible number of imposters among the players. This involves exploring different configurations and selecting the one with the highest count of imposters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph construction and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously.

An 'imposter' is someone who is lying, while a 'crewmate' is someone who is telling the truth. The goal is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on the comments provided.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that we need to find the largest number of imposters that can be identified without contradictions. In code, this can be implemented by traversing the graph and counting the imposters in each connected component.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The term 'maximum' refers to the largest possible number of imposters that can be identified. This can be implemented by using graph traversal techniques to explore all possible configurations and select the one with the highest number of imposters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to detecting contradictions and determining the maximum number of imposters should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while traversing the graph to detect contradictions, we can also count the imposters in each component. This can be done using a BFS or DFS approach where we simultaneously check for contradictions and count imposters.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: If there are no comments, all players can be imposters since there are no contradictions.\n    \n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, so the output should be -1.\n    \n    Test case with all players as crewmates (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 crewmate\", \"2 3 crewmate\", \"1 3 crewmate\") = 0\n    Explanation: If all comments indicate crewmates, then no imposters can be identified.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to implement logic to handle cases with no comments and cases with contradictory comments.\n    ```python\n    if m == 0:\n        print(n)\n    elif contradiction_detected:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        # logic to", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            results.append(n)\n            continue\n        \n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for _ in range(m):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            c = data[index + 2]\n            index += 3\n            graph[i].append((j, c))\n            graph[j].append((i, c))\n        \n        color = {}\n        contradiction_detected = False\n        max_imposters = 0\n        \n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n            color[start] = 0\n            count = [0, 0]\n            count[0] += 1\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, col = queue.popleft()\n                \n                for neighbor, relation in graph[node]:\n                    expected_color = col if relation == 'crewmate' else 1 -

The goal is to determine the maximum number of imposters or identify contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of imposters'\n    Explanation: This means finding the highest number of players that can be classified as imposters without contradicting the given comments. In code, this involves traversing the graph and counting nodes that can be labeled as imposters.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This refers to the largest possible count of imposters that can be deduced from the comments without contradictions. In code, this is implemented by ensuring the graph is colored correctly and counting the nodes labeled as imposters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the second subproblem should be implemented simultaneously:\n    - \"Model the problem as a graph where each player is a node and each comment is an edge with a label ('imposter' or 'crewmate').\"\n    - \"Use a graph traversal technique (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to color the graph with two colors representing 'imposter' and 'crewmate'.\"\n    - \"Check for contradictions during traversal: if a node needs to be colored differently than expected, a contradiction exists.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single traversal function that both colors the graph and checks for contradictions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1.

This allows for efficient detection of contradictions while building the graph.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: If there are no comments, there are no contradictions, and all players can be considered imposters.\n    \n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, so the output should be -1.\n    \n    Test case with all players commenting as imposters (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 imposter\", \"2 3 imposter\", \"1 3 imposter\") = 3\n    Explanation: If all comments are consistent and indicate imposters, the maximum number of imposters is equal to the number of players.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to check for contradictions during graph traversal and handle cases with no comments separately.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(n, m, comments):\n        if m == 0:\n            return n\n        # Implement graph traversal to detect contradictions\n       ", "Round_0": {"code": "def solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, m = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            results.append(n)\n            continue\n        \n        from collections import defaultdict, deque\n        \n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            i, j, c = data[index].split()\n            i, j = int(i), int(j)\n            graph[i].append((j, c))\n            graph[j].append((i, c))\n            index += 1\n        \n        color = {}\n        \n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n            color[start] = 0\n            count = [0, 0]\n            count[0] += 1\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, col = queue.popleft()\n                \n                for neighbor, relation in graph[node]:\n                    expected_color = col if relation == 'crewmate' else 1 -
