{"name": "1618_A. Polycarp and Sums of Subsequences", "description": "Polycarp had an array a of 3 positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array b of 7 integers.\n\nFor example, if a = \\{1, 4, 3\\}, then Polycarp wrote out 1, 4, 3, 1 + 4 = 5, 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8. After sorting, he got an array b = \\{1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}.\n\nUnfortunately, Polycarp lost the array a. He only has the array b left.
