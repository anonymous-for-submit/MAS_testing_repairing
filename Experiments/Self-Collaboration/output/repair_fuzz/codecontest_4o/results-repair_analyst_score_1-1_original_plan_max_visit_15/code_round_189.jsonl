{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",

particular order. In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute difference'\n    Explanation: The absolute difference between two numbers x and y is |x-y|, which is the non-negative difference between them. The goal is to minimize the sum of these differences between the original ratings p and the new ratings q.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': For all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i > q_j should hold. This means that liked songs should have higher ratings than disliked songs.\n    Implementation: This can be implemented by sorting liked songs to have higher ratings and disliked songs to have lower ratings.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': The permutation q should have the smallest possible value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|.\n    Implementation: This involves sorting the liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes the absolute difference.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings should be implemented simultaneously.

In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'like/dislike'\n    Explanation: This refers to Monocarp's feedback on each song, where '1' indicates a liked song and '0' indicates a disliked song. The requirement is to ensure that liked songs have higher ratings than disliked ones.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than'\n    Explanation: For every song that Monocarp liked, its new rating must be greater than the rating of any song he disliked. This can be implemented by ensuring that all liked songs are assigned higher numbers in the permutation than disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest'\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the permutation q that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the original ratings p and the new ratings q. This can be implemented by sorting and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes these differences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan for sorting and assigning ratings to liked and disliked songs should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, after sorting liked and disliked songs, the assignment of ratings should be done in one step to ensure the permutation condition is met.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge Case 1: n = 1, p = [1], s = \"0\"\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one song and it being disliked, the only permutation is itself.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 2, p = [2, 1], s = \"01\"\n    Expected Output: 1 2\n    Explanation: The disliked song gets the lower rating, and the liked song gets the higher rating.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 3, p = [3, 2, 1], s = \"111\"\n    Expected Output: 3 2 1\n    Explanation: All songs are liked, so the permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the original permutation.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

is a rearrangement of elements in a particular order. In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value without regard to its sign. Here, it is used to calculate the difference between predicted and new ratings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than'\n    Explanation: Songs that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than those he disliked. This means for indices i and j, if s_i=1 and s_j=0, then q_i > q_j.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest'\n    Explanation: Among all valid permutations, we need to find the one with the smallest sum of absolute differences between predicted and new ratings.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps of sorting liked songs in descending order and disliked songs in ascending order should be implemented simultaneously to ensure the correct assignment of ratings. This can be done by sorting both lists and then assigning ratings in a single loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: n = 1, p = [1], s = \"0\"\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one song and it being disliked, the permutation remains the same.\n\n    Case 2: n = 2, p = [2, 1], s = \"01\"\n    Expected output: 1 2\n    Explanation: The disliked song gets the lower rating, and the liked song gets the higher rating.\n\n    Case 3: n = 3, p = [3, 2, 1], s = \"000\"\n    Expected output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: All songs are disliked, so the permutation remains the same.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

In this context, it means that the ratings q must be a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n, where each number appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute difference'\n    Explanation: The absolute difference between two numbers x and y is |x-y|, which is the non-negative difference between them. The goal is to minimize the sum of these differences between the original ratings p and the new ratings q.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': For all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i > q_j should hold. This means that liked songs should have higher ratings than disliked songs.\n    Implementation: This can be implemented by sorting liked songs to have higher ratings and disliked songs to have lower ratings.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': The permutation q should have the smallest possible value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|.\n    Implementation: This involves sorting the liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes the absolute difference.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Sort liked_songs and disliked_songs.\"\n    - \"Assign the highest available ratings to liked_songs and the lowest available ratings to disliked_songs.\"\n    These can be done in a single code block where sorting and assignment are handled together.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all songs liked: \n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 111\n    Output: 3 1 2\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, the permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.\n\n    Test case with all songs disliked:\n    Input: 3, 3 1 2, 000\n    Output: 1 2 3\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, the permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.\n\n    Test case with alternating likes and dislikes:\n    Input: 4, 4 3 2 1, 1010\n    Output: 4 1 3 2\n    Explanation: Liked songs (4, 2) should have higher", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        liked_songs = []\n        disliked_songs = []\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                liked_songs.append(p[i])\n            else:\n                disliked_songs.append(p[i])\n        \n        liked_songs.sort()\n        disliked_songs.sort()\n        \n        q = [0] * n\n        current_rating = 1\n        \n        for song in disliked_songs:\n            q[p.index(song)] = current_rating\n            current_rating += 1\n        \n        for song in liked_songs:\n            q[p.index(song)] = current_rating\n            current_rating += 1\n        \n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, q)))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 189, "prompt": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module. So imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n, with the i-th song having its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once, meaning p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button, with his vote sequence represented by a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it. Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|.
