{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

In code, this means iterating over all permutations and selecting the one with the highest calculated surprise value.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This refers to the highest possible value of the surprise value. In code, this involves comparing calculated surprise values and keeping track of the highest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to calculating the surprise value for each permutation and selecting the maximum should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the steps:\n    - \"Calculate the surprise value for each permutation using the formula \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|.\"\n    - \"Select the permutation that results in the maximum surprise value.\"\n    These can be done in a single loop where you calculate and compare surprise values.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge cases are not explicitly given in the requirement, but we can infer some:\n    - Case with minimum values: 1 student, 1 question, expected points 0, answer incorrect.\n      Example: Input: 1 1, 0, 0; Output: 1\n      Explanation: With only one question and an incorrect answer, the permutation doesn't affect the result, but the surprise value is maximized trivially.\n    - Case with all correct answers: 1 student, m questions, expected points equal to the sum of 1 to m, all answers correct.\n      Example: Input: 1 m, m(m+1)/2, 111...1; Output: any permutation\n      Explanation: Any permutation will result in the same actual points, so the surprise value is zero.\n    - Case with all incorrect answers: 1 student, m questions, expected points 0, all answers incorrect.\n      Example: Input: 1 m, 0, 000...0; Output: any", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, permutation):\n    surprise_value = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        actual_points = sum(permutation[j] for j in range(m) if answers[i][j] == '1')\n        surprise_value += abs(expected_points[i] - actual_points)\n    return surprise_value\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        expected_points = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        answers = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            answers.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of points from 1 to m\n        permutations = itertools.permutations(range(1, m + 1))\n        \n        max_surprise_value = -1\n        best_permutation = None\n        \n        for permutation in permutations:\n            surprise_value = calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, permutation)\n            if surprise_value > max_surprise_value:\n                max_surprise_value = surprise_value\n                best_permutation = permutation\n        \n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, best_permutation)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: calculate_surprise_value() missing 5 required positional arguments: 'n', 'm', 'expected_points', 'answers', and 'permutation'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "import sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        expected_points = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        answers = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            answers.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # To maximize the surprise value, we need to maximize the difference\n        # between expected and actual points.
