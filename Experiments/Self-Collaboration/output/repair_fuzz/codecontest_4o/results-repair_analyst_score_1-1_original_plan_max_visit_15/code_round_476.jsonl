{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

This involves comparing the surprise values of all permutations and selecting the largest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Generate all permutations of the question points array\" and \"Calculate the actual points each student would get\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating through each permutation and calculating the actual points in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Edge cases are not explicitly provided in the requirement, but we can infer some:\n    - Case where all students expect zero points: The permutation should still be calculated, and the surprise value will be based on the actual points.\n    - Case where all questions are answered incorrectly: The permutation should still be calculated, and the surprise value will be based on the expected points.\n    - Case where m = 1: Only one permutation is possible, and the surprise value is straightforward to calculate.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where m = 1 or all students expect zero points. This can be handled by checking these conditions before generating permutations.\n\n    if m == 1:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        # Proceed with generating permutations and calculating surprise values\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef calculate_surprise_value(n, m, x, s, p):\n    r = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if s[i][j] == '1':\n                r[i] += p[j]\n    surprise_value = sum(abs(x[i] - r[i]) for i in range(n))\n    return surprise_value\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        x = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        s = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Generate the initial permutation of points\n        p = list(range(1, m + 1))\n        \n        # If m == 1, only one permutation is possible\n        if m == 1:\n            results.append(\"1\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Find the permutation with the maximum surprise value\n        max_surprise_value = -1\n        best_permutation = None\n        \n        for perm in permutations(p):\n            surprise_value = calculate_surprise_value(n, m, x, s, perm)\n            if surprise_value > max_surprise_value:\n                max_surprise_value = surprise_value\n                best_permutation = perm\n        \n        results.append(\" \".join(map(str, best_permutation)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: calculate_surprise_value() missing 5 required positional arguments: 'n', 'm', 'x', 's', and 'p'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        x = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        s = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the number of correct answers for each question\n        correct_counts = [0] * m\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if s[i][j] == '1':\n                    correct_counts[j] += 1\n        \n        # Pair each question with its correct count and sort by correct count\n        question_indices = list(range(m))\n        question_indices.sort(key=lambda j: correct_counts[j])\n        \n        # Assign points in increasing order of correct counts\n        p = [0] * m\n        for rank, j in enumerate(question_indices):\n            p[j] = rank + 1\n        \n        results.append(\" \".join(map(str, p)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 476, "prompt": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions.
