{"name": "1613_C. Poisoned Dagger", "description": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64

This can be implemented using a binary search to efficiently find the smallest k.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the damage calculation and adjusting the binary search range should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the steps:\n    - \"Simulate the damage calculation for each k during the binary search.\"\n    - \"Check if the total damage is at least h.\"\n    These can be done in a single loop within the binary search logic.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Edge Case 1: n = 1, h = 1, a = [1]\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one attack needed and h = 1, the minimum k is 1.\n\n    Edge Case 2: n = 100, h = 1, a = [1, 2, ..., 100]\n    Expected Output: 1\n    Explanation: Even with 100 attacks, if h = 1, the minimum k is still 1 because any k >= 1 will satisfy the condition.\n\n    Edge Case 3: n = 1, h = 10^18, a = [1]\n    Expected Output: 10^18\n    Explanation: With only one attack and a very large h, k must be equal to h to satisfy the condition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The binary search logic inherently handles these cases by adjusting the range of k based on the damage calculation.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def minimum_k_for_damage(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, h, attack_times = case\n        left, right = 1, h\n        \n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            total_damage = 0\n            \n            for i in range(n):\n                if i == n - 1:\n                    total_damage += mid\n                else:\n                    total_damage += min(mid, attack_times[i + 1] - attack_times[i])\n            \n            if total_damage >= h:\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        \n        results.append(left)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        h = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        attack_times = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, h, attack_times))\n    \n    results = minimum_k_for_damage(t, test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 10, "round": 672, "prompt": "Monocarp is curious if the venom will be potent enough to overcome the dragon prior to the conclusion of the battle.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64 1337\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n470\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, for k=3, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7].\n\nIn the second example, for k=4, damage is dealt in seconds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13].\n\nIn the third example, for k=1, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 4, 5, 7].", "examples": "\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64 1337\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n470\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, for k=3, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7].\n\nIn the second example, for k=4, damage is dealt in seconds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13].\n\nIn the third example, for k=1, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 4, 5, 7].", "mutate_method": "rephrase_one", "save_node": false, "parent_index": 256}
