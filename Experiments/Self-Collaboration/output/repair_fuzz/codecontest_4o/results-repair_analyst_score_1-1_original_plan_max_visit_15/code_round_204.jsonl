{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    'For all 1 < x < a': This indicates a range of rows within the sub-rectangle where certain conditions must be met.\n    'For all 1 < x < b': This indicates a range of columns within the sub-rectangle where certain conditions must be met.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum': This refers to finding the least number of operations required to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this can be implemented by tracking the smallest count of operations needed across all sub-rectangles.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to identifying sub-rectangles and calculating operations should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while iterating over possible sub-rectangles, the calculation of operations needed to transform them into portals should occur within the same loop to efficiently track the minimum operations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: A rectangle with dimensions exactly 5x4 and all blocks already satisfy the portal conditions.\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already meets the portal conditions.\n    \n    Case 2: A rectangle with dimensions larger than 5x4 but no possible sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal.\n    Expected output: -1 (or some indication that transformation is impossible)\n    Explanation: If no sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal, the output should reflect this impossibility.\n    \n    Case 3: A rectangle with dimensions 5x4 where all blocks are empty.\n    Expected output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where no sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal.\n    ```python\n    if min_operations == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_operations)\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_portal(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, m, grid = case\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n        for i in range(n -

In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that any sub-rectangle considered has dimensions at least 5 rows and 4 columns.\n    'For all 1 < x < a': This indicates a range of rows within the sub-rectangle where certain conditions must be met.\n    'For all 1 < x < b': This indicates a range of columns within the sub-rectangle where certain conditions must be met.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'minimum': This refers to finding the least number of operations required to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this can be implemented by tracking the smallest count of operations needed across all sub-rectangles.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to identifying sub-rectangles and calculating operations should be considered simultaneously. Specifically, while iterating over possible sub-rectangles, the calculation of operations needed to transform them into portals should occur within the same loop to efficiently track the minimum operations.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: A rectangle with dimensions exactly 5x4 and all blocks already satisfy the portal conditions.\n    Expected output: 0\n    Explanation: No operations are needed as the rectangle already meets the portal conditions.\n    \n    Case 2: A rectangle with dimensions larger than 5x4 but no possible sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal.\n    Expected output: -1 (or some indication that transformation is impossible)\n    Explanation: If no sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal, the output should reflect this impossibility.\n    \n    Case 3: A rectangle with dimensions 5x4 where all blocks are empty.\n    Expected output: 12\n    Explanation: All border blocks need to be changed to obsidian, requiring 12 operations.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where no sub-rectangle can be transformed into a portal.\n    ```python\n    if min_operations == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_operations)\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_portal(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, m, grid = case\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n        for i in range(n - 4):  # a must be at least 5\n            for j in range(m - 3):  # b must be at least 4\n                # Iterate over all possible dimensions a and b\n                for a in range(5, n - i + 1):\n                    for b in range(4, m - j + 1):\n                        operations = 0\n                        \n                        # Check border conditions\n                        for x in range(1, a - 1):\n                            if grid[i + x][j] != '1':\n                                operations += 1\n                            if grid[i + x][j + b - 1] != '1':\n                                operations += 1\n                        \n                        for y in range(1, b - 1):\n                            if grid[i][j + y] != '1':\n                                operations += 1\n                            if grid[i + a - 1][j + y] != '1':\n                                operations += 1\n                        \n                        # Check inner conditions\n                        for x in range(1, a - 1):\n                            for y in range(1, b - 1):\n                                if grid[i + x][j + y] != '0':\n                                    operations += 1\n                        \n                        min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)\n        \n        if min_operations == float('inf'):\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            results.append(min_operations)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        test_cases.append((n, m, grid))\n    \n    results = min_operations_to_portal(t, test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 8, "round": 204, "prompt": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m.
