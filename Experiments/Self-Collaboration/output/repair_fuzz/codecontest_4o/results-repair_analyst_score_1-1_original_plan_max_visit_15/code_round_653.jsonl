{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",

is a rearrangement of elements in a particular order. In this context, it means that the ratings are a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly once.\n\n    'like/dislike'\n    Explanation: This refers to the binary feedback Monocarp gives to each song, where '1' indicates a like and '0' indicates a dislike.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than'\n    Explanation: For every song Monocarp liked, its new rating should be greater than the rating of any song he disliked. This can be implemented by ensuring that all liked songs are assigned higher numbers than disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest'\n    Explanation: Among all valid permutations, we need to find the one that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the original and new ratings. This can be implemented by sorting and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes changes.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps of sorting liked and disliked songs and then assigning new ratings should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by first sorting both groups and then assigning ratings in a single pass to ensure the order constraint is satisfied.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: n = 1, p = [1], s = \"0\"\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one song and it being disliked, the only permutation is itself.\n\n    Case 2: n = 2, p = [2, 1], s = \"01\"\n    Expected output: 1 2\n    Explanation: The disliked song gets the lowest rating, and the liked song gets the highest.\n\n    Case 3: n = 3, p = [3, 2, 1], s = \"111\"\n    Expected output: 3 2 1\n    Explanation: All songs are liked, so the permutation can remain the same to minimize the sum of absolute differences.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

In this context, it means that the ratings are a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly once.\n\n    'like/dislike'\n    Explanation: This refers to the binary feedback Monocarp gives to each song, where '1' indicates a like and '0' indicates a dislike.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than'\n    Explanation: For every song Monocarp liked, its new rating should be greater than the rating of any song he disliked. This can be implemented by ensuring that all liked songs are assigned higher numbers than disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'smallest'\n    Explanation: Among all valid permutations, we need to find the one that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the original and new ratings. This can be implemented by sorting and assigning ratings in a way that minimizes changes.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps of sorting liked and disliked songs and then assigning new ratings should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by first sorting both groups and then assigning ratings in a single pass to ensure the order constraint is satisfied.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Case 1: n = 1, p = [1], s = \"0\"\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: With only one song and it being disliked, the only permutation is itself.\n\n    Case 2: n = 2, p = [2, 1], s = \"01\"\n    Expected output: 1 2\n    Explanation: The disliked song gets the lowest rating, and the liked song gets the highest.\n\n    Case 3: n = 3, p = [3, 2, 1], s = \"111\"\n    Expected output: 3 2 1\n    Explanation: All songs are liked, so the permutation can remain the same to minimize the sum of absolute differences.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
