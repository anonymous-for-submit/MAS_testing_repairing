{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The goal is to execute as many commands as possible without the robot falling off the board.\n\n    'optimal starting position'\n    Explanation: The task is to find the starting position on the board that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible'\n    Explanation: This means the robot should execute the maximum number of commands from the sequence without falling off the board. In code, this can be implemented by simulating the robot's movement from each possible starting position and counting the number of commands executed before falling off.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed. In code, this involves keeping track of the highest number of commands executed from any starting position.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially. However, the simulation of the robot's movement for each starting position can be optimized by considering boundary conditions simultaneously within the simulation loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with a 1x1 board and a command sequence 'L' = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: The robot cannot move anywhere on a 1x1 board, so the starting position is the only cell available.\n    \n    Test case with a 1x2 board and a command sequence 'LR' = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: The robot can start at (1, 1) and execute the 'L' command, but the 'R' command will cause it to fall off the board. Starting at (1, 2) will cause the 'L' command to fail immediately.\n    \n    Test case with a 3x3 board and a command sequence 'UUU' = (3, 1)\n    Explanation: Starting at (3, 1) allows the robot to execute all 'U' commands without falling off the board.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should check if the robot's movement causes it to fall off the board and stop executing further commands if it does.

This starting position allows the maximum number of commands (2) to be executed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the board size is minimal (1x1) or the command sequence is such that no commands can be executed successfully.\n    ```python\n    if n == 1 and m == ", "Round_0": {"code": "def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        s = data[index + 2]\n        index += 3\n        \n        # Initialize variables to track the best starting position\n        best_r, best_c = 1, 1\n        max_commands = 0\n        \n        # Simulate the robot's movement for each possible starting position\n        for start_r in range(1, n + 1):\n            for start_c in range(1, m + 1):\n                r, c = start_r, start_c\n                commands_executed = 0\n                for command in s:\n                    if command == 'L':\n                        c -= 1\n                    elif command == 'R':\n                        c += 1\n                    elif command == 'U':\n                        r -= 1\n                    elif command == 'D':\n                        r += 1\n                    \n                    # Check if the robot falls off the board\n                    if r < 1 or r > n or c < 1 or c > m:\n                        break\n                    commands_executed += 1\n                \n                # Update the best starting position if needed\n                if commands_executed > max_commands:\n                    max_commands = commands_executed\n                    best_r, best_c = start_r, start_c\n        \n        results.append(f\"{best_r} {best_c}\")\n    \n    # Output the results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases, board dimensions, and command sequences.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"Read the integer t representing the number of test cases.\",\n        \"For each test case, read integers n and m representing the board dimensions.\",\n        \"Read the string s representing the sequence of commands.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Simulate the robot's movement on the board for each test case to determine the optimal starting position.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"Initialize variables to track the robot's position and the number of successfully executed commands.\",\n        \"Iterate over all possible starting positions on the board.\",\n        \"For each starting position, simulate the execution of the command sequence s.\",\n        \"Track the number of commands executed before the robot falls off the board.\",\n        \"Update the optimal starting position if the current position allows more commands to be executed.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Output the optimal starting position for each test case.\",\n      \"steps\": [\n        \"For each test case, print the row and column of the optimal starting position.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"high_level_plan\": [\n    \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases, board dimensions, and command sequences.\",\n    \"For each test case, iterate over all possible starting positions on the board.\",\n    \"Simulate the robot's movement from each starting position using the command sequence.\",\n    \"Track the number of commands executed successfully before the robot falls off the board.\",\n    \"Determine the starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed.\",\n    \"Output the optimal starting position for each test case.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'robot movement'\n    Explanation: The robot can move in four directions: left (L), right (R), down (D), and up (U). The goal is to execute as many commands as possible without the robot falling off the board.\n\n    'optimal starting position'\n    Explanation: The task is to find the starting position on the board that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible'\n    Explanation: This means the robot should execute the maximum number of commands from the sequence without falling off the board. In code, this can be implemented by simulating the robot's movement from each possible starting position and counting the number of commands executed before falling off.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the starting position that allows the maximum number of commands to be executed. In code, this involves keeping track of the highest number of commands executed from any starting position.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially. However, the simulation of the robot's movement for each starting position can be optimized by considering boundary conditions simultaneously within the simulation loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case with a 1x1 board and a command sequence 'L' = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: The robot cannot move anywhere on a 1x1 board, so the starting position is the only cell available.\n    \n    Test case with a 1x2 board and a command sequence 'LR' = (1, 1)\n    Explanation: The robot can start at (1, 1) and execute the 'L' command, but the 'R' command will cause it to fall off the board. Starting at (1, 2) will cause the 'L' command to fail immediately.\n    \n    Test case with a 3x3 board and a command sequence 'UUU' = (3, 1)\n    Explanation: Starting at (3, 1) allows the robot to execute all 'U' commands without falling off the board.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should check if the robot's movement causes it to fall off the board and stop executing further commands if it does. This can be done by checking the robot's position after each command and ensuring it remains within the board boundaries.\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def find_optimal_starting_position(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, s in test_cases:\n        # Initialize the boundaries for the starting position\n        min_r, max_r = 1, n\n        min_c, max_c = 1, m\n        \n        # Current position of the robot\n        current_r, current_c = 0, 0\n        \n        # Track the boundaries of the robot's path\n        min_path_r, max_path_r = 0, 0\n        min_path_c, max_path_c = 0, 0\n        \n        for command in s:\n            if command == 'L':\n                current_c -= 1\n            elif command == 'R':\n                current_c += 1\n            elif command == 'U':\n                current_r -= 1\n            elif command == 'D':\n                current_r += 1\n            \n            # Update the path boundaries\n            min_path_r = min(min_path_r, current_r)\n            max_path_r = max(max_path_r, current_r)\n            min_path_c = min(min_path_c, current_c)\n            max_path_c = max(max_path_c, current_c)\n            \n            # Check if the current path can fit within the board\n            if (max_path_r - min_path_r + 1) > n or (max_path_c - min_path_c + 1) > m:\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible starting position boundaries\n            min_r = max(min_r, 1 - min_path_r)\n            max_r = min(max_r, n - max_path_r)\n            min_c = max(min_c, 1 - min_path_c)\n            max_c = min(max_c, m - max_path_c)\n        \n        # The optimal starting position can be any within the valid range\n        results.append((min_r, min_c))\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        s = data[index + 2]\n        test_cases.append((n, m, s))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = find_optimal_starting_position(t, test_cases)\n    \n    for r, c in results", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: invalid syntax (<string>, line 66)"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def find_optimal_starting_position(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, s in test_cases:\n        # Initialize the boundaries for the starting position\n        min_r, max_r = 1, n\n        min_c, max_c = 1, m\n        \n        # Current position of the robot\n        current_r, current_c = 0, 0\n        \n        # Track the boundaries of the robot's path\n        min_path_r, max_path_r = 0, 0\n        min_path_c, max_path_c = 0, 0\n        \n        for command in s:\n            if command == 'L':\n                current_c -= 1\n            elif command == 'R':\n                current_c += 1\n            elif command == 'U':\n                current_r -= 1\n            elif command == 'D':\n                current_r += 1\n            \n            # Update the path boundaries\n            min_path_r = min(min_path_r, current_r)\n            max_path_r = max(max_path_r, current_r)\n            min_path_c = min(min_path_c, current_c)\n            max_path_c = max(max_path_c, current_c)\n            \n            # Check if the current path can fit within the board\n            if (max_path_r - min_path_r + 1) > n or (max_path_c - min_path_c + 1) > m:\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible starting position boundaries\n            min_r = max(min_r, 1 - min_path_r)\n            max_r = min(max_r, n - max_path_r)\n            min_c = max(min_c, 1 - min_path_c)\n            max_c = min(max_c, m - max_path_c)\n        \n        # The optimal starting position can be any within the valid range\n        results.append((min_r, min_c))\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        s = data[index + 2]\n        test_cases.append((n, m, s))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = find_optimal_starting_position(t, test_cases)\n    \n    for r, c in results"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, true, true, false, false, false, true, false, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 579, "prompt": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board measuring n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns).
