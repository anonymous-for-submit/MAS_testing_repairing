{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

In code, this can be checked using a loop to compare the current day and the previous day.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This means the flower's height increases by 1 cm if watered on a single day.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This means the flower's height increases by 5 cm if watered on two consecutive days.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Check if the flower dies due to two consecutive days without watering\" and \"Update the flower height based on the watering pattern\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating through the list of watering days and checking both conditions in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Input: 1, [0] = 1\n       Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it needs two consecutive days without water to die. The height remains 1 cm.\n    2. Input: 2, [0, 0] = -1\n       Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies, resulting in a height of -1.\n    3. Input: 3, [1, 1, 0] = 6\n       Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days, growing by 5 cm on the second day, and not watered on the third day, resulting in a final height of 6 cm.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    ```python\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        height = 1\n        consecutive_dry_days = 0\n        for day in watering_days:\n            if day == 1:\n                if consecutive_dry_days == 2:\n                    height = -1\n                    break\n                height += 1\n                if previous_day_was_watered:\n                    height += 4  #
