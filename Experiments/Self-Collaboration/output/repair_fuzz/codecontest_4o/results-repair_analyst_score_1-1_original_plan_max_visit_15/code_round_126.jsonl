{"name": "1579_B. Shifting Sort", "description": "The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2. The segment a[1 \u2026 5] is then selected and is shifted to the left by 3: [\\color{blue}{2, 4, 5, 1, 3}] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}] \n  3. After that the segment a[1 \u2026 2] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{1, 3}, 2, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{3, 1}, 2, 4, 5] \n  4. And in the end the segment a[1 \u2026 3] is selected and is shifted to the left by 1: [\\color{blue}{3, 1, 2}, 4, 5] \\longrightarrow [\\color{blue}{1, 2, 3}, 4, 5] ", "tags": ["implementation",

This can be implemented by iterating over the array to find unsorted segments and immediately applying the necessary shifts.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with already sorted array:\n    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    Expected Output: 0\n    Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no shifts are needed.\n\n    Test case with maximum shifts:\n    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n    Expected Output: 5\n    Explanation: Each element needs to be shifted to its correct position, potentially requiring the maximum number of shifts.\n\n    Test case with repeated elements:\n    Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n    Expected Output: 2\n    Explanation: The repeated elements need to be shifted to achieve a sorted order, but fewer shifts are needed due to repetition.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the array is already sorted or when dealing with repeated elements.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(array):\n        if array == sorted(array):\n            return 0, []\n        # Additional logic for repeated elements or other specific cases\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def cyclic_shift(arr, l, r, d):\n    \"\"\"Perform a cyclic shift to the left by d positions on the segment arr[l:r+1].\"\"\"\n    segment = arr[l:r+1]\n    d = d % len(segment)  # Ensure d is within the bounds of the segment length\n    shifted_segment = segment[d:] + segment[:d]\n    arr[l:r+1] = shifted_segment\n\ndef solve(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, array in test_cases:\n        actions = []\n        sorted_array = sorted(array)\n        \n        if array == sorted_array:\n            results.append((0, actions))\n            continue\n        \n        # Simple approach: bubble sort-like method using cyclic shifts\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n - 1):\n                if array[j] > array[j + 1]:\n                    # Perform a cyclic shift on the segment [j, j+1]\n                    cyclic_shift(array, j, j + 1, 1)\n                    actions.append((j + 1, j + 2, 1))\n        \n        results.append((len(actions), actions))\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, array))\n    \n    results = solve(test_cases)\n    \n    for k, actions in results:\n        print(k)\n        for l, r, d in actions:\n            print(l, r, d)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: unexpected EOF while parsing (<string>, line 97)"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def cyclic_shift(arr, l, r, d):\n    \"\"\"Perform a cyclic shift to the left by d positions on the segment arr[l:r+1].\"\"\"\n    segment = arr[l:r+1]\n    d = d % len(segment)  # Ensure d is within the bounds of the segment length\n    shifted_segment = segment[d:] + segment[:d]\n    arr[l:r+1] = shifted_segment\n\ndef solve(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for n, array in test_cases:\n        actions = []\n        sorted_array = sorted(array)\n        \n        if array == sorted_array:\n            results.append((0, actions))\n            continue\n        \n        # Simple approach: bubble sort-like method using cyclic shifts\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n - 1):\n                if array[j] > array[j + 1]:\n                    # Perform a cyclic shift on the segment [j, j+1]\n                    cyclic_shift(array, j, j + 1, 1)\n                    actions.append((j + 1, j + 2, 1))\n        \n        results.append((len(actions), actions))\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        test_cases.append((n, array))\n    \n    results = solve(test_cases)\n    \n    for k, actions in results:\n        print(k)\n        for l, r, d in actions:\n            print(l, r, d)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n"}}, {"plan": "```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Parse the input to extract the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.\",\n      \"details\": \"Read the integer t from the first line, then for each test case, read the integer n and the array of integers a.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the array is already sorted.\",\n      \"details\": \"Check if the array a is in non-decreasing order.

Instead, it permits you to extract any segment of the provided array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset, and reintegrate it back into the identical position.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions:\n\n  1. You have the option to choose any indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the segment's limits.\n  2. The segment a[l \u2026 r] is then replaced with a cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. Cyclic shift is also illustrated by these relations: the series [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 1, and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by 2.\n\nFor instance, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then selecting l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 results in a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is subsequently shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you obtain a segment [8, 3, 2] that then replaces the original elements of the segment. Finally, you have a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nRearrange the specified array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.
