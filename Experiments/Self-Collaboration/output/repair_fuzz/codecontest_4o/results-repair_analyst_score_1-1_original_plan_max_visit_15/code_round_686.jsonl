{"name": "1622_B. Berland Music", "description": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 1\n3 1 2\n1 6 5 8 3 2 4 7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation q such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song 1 gets rating 2 and song 2 gets rating 1. \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2.\n\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to p. Its cost is 0.", "tags": ["data structures", "greedy", "math", "sortings"], "difficulty": 8, "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n2\n1 2\n10\n3\n3 1 2\n111\n8\n2 3 1 8 5 4 7 6\n01110001\n",

order. In this context, it means that the predicted ratings and the re-evaluated ratings must be a sequence where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Here, it is used to calculate the sum of differences between predicted and re-evaluated ratings.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the re-evaluated rating of liked songs must be higher than that of disliked songs.\n    Implementation: Use sorting and assignment logic to ensure liked songs have higher ratings than disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This refers to finding the permutation q that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between predicted and re-evaluated ratings.\n    Implementation: Sort and assign ratings in a way that minimizes the sum of |p_i - q_i|.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for sorting liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings should be implemented simultaneously.\n    Explanation: Sorting both liked and disliked songs and assigning ratings can be done in a single code block to ensure efficiency and correctness.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with all songs liked: If s consists entirely of '1's, the permutation q should be the same as p to minimize the sum of absolute differences.\n    Example: n = 3, p = [3, 1, 2], s = \"111\" => q = [3, 1, 2]\n    Explanation: Since all songs are liked, the permutation q that minimizes the sum is the same as p.\n\n    Test case with all songs disliked: If s consists entirely of '0's, the permutation q should be the reverse of p to minimize the sum of absolute differences.\n    Example: n = 3, p = [3, 1, 2], s = \"000\" => q = [1, 2, 3]\n    Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, assigning the lowest ratings minimizes the sum.\n\n    Test case with alternating likes and dislikes: If s alternates between '1' and '0', ensure that liked songs have higher ratings than disliked songs.\n    Example: n = 4, p = [4, 3, 2, 1], s = \"1010\" => q = [", "Round_0": {"code": "def solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n

Here, it is used to calculate the difference between the predicted and new ratings without considering the sign.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the new rating for liked songs must be higher than the new rating for disliked songs. In code, this can be implemented by ensuring that indices of liked songs are assigned higher values than those of disliked songs.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This refers to finding the permutation q that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the predicted and new ratings. In code, this can be achieved by sorting and assigning values in a way that minimizes these differences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to sorting and assigning ratings to liked and disliked songs should be implemented simultaneously.

elements in a particular order. In this context, it means that the predicted ratings and the new ratings must each contain every integer from 1 to n exactly once.\n\n    'absolute value'\n    Explanation: The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value. Here, it is used to calculate the difference between predicted and new ratings without considering the sign.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'greater than': This indicates that the new rating for liked songs must be higher than the new rating for disliked songs. In code, this can be implemented using comparison operators (e.g., `>`).\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'smallest': This refers to finding the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences. In code, this can be achieved by sorting and assigning values strategically to minimize differences.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Steps 3 and 4 should be considered simultaneously. Sorting the liked and disliked songs and then assigning new ratings should be done in a single logical block to ensure that the conditions are met efficiently.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1.

Test case with all songs disliked:\n       Input: 3, 3 1 2, 000\n       Expected Output: 1 2 3\n       Explanation: Since all songs are disliked, the permutation that minimizes the sum of absolute differences is the original permutation.\n\n    3. Test case with alternating likes and dislikes:\n       Input: 4, 1 2 3 4, 1010\n       Expected Output: 3 1 4 2\n       Explanation: Liked songs (1, 3) should have higher ratings than disliked songs (2, 4). The permutation minimizes the sum of absolute differences.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.

This predicted rating lies between 1 and n inclusive. Every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button.
