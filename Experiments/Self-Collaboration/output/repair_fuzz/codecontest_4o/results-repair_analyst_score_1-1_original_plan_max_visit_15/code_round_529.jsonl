{"name": "1600_F. Party Organization", "description": "On the great island of Baltia, there live N people, numbered from 1 to N. There are exactly M pairs of people that are friends with each other. The people of Baltia want to organize a successful party, but they have very strict rules on what a party is and when the party is successful. On the island of Baltia, a party is a gathering of exactly 5 people. The party is considered to be successful if either all the people at the party are friends with each other (so that they can all talk to each other without having to worry about talking to someone they are not friends with) or no two people at the party are friends with each other (so that everyone can just be on their phones without anyone else bothering them). Please help the people of Baltia organize a successful party or tell them that it's impossible to do so.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers, N (5 \u2264 N \u2264 2*10^5) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 2*10^5) \u2013 the number of people that live in Baltia, and the number of friendships. The next M lines each contains two integers U_i and V_i (1 \u2264 U_i,V_i \u2264 N) \u2013 meaning that person U_i is friends with person V_i. Two friends can not be in the list of friends twice (no pairs are repeated) and a person can be friends with themselves (U_i \u2260 V_i).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to organize a successful party, print 5 numbers indicating which 5 people should be invited to the party. If it's not possible to organize a successful party, print -1 instead. If there are multiple successful parties possible, print any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6 3\n1 4\n4 2\n5 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 3 5 6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1",

people where either all are friends with each other or none are friends with each other.\n\n    'friendship'\n    Explanation: Friendship is represented by pairs of people who can communicate directly with each other.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'exactly 5 people': This means the party must consist of precisely 5 individuals.\n    Implementation: Use combinations of 5 people from the list of N people.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'all': This means every pair within the group of 5 must be friends.\n    Implementation: Check if all pairs in a combination are present in the friendship graph.\n\n    'no two': This means none of the pairs within the group of 5 should be friends.\n    Implementation: Check if none of the pairs in a combination are present in the friendship graph.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for checking if all 5 people are friends and if no two people are friends can be implemented simultaneously by iterating over combinations of 5 people and checking both conditions in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Case 1: N = 5, M = 0\n    Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n    Explanation: With 5 people and no friendships, a successful party can be formed where no two people are friends.\n\n    Case 2: N = 5, M = 10\n    Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n    Explanation: With 5 people and all possible friendships, a successful party can be formed where all are friends.\n\n    Case 3: N = 6, M = 0\n    Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n    Explanation: With more than 5 people and no friendships, a successful party can be formed where no two people are friends.\n\n# [extra code for edge
