{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

The flower's growth is determined by whether it is watered on consecutive days or not watered at all.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two consecutive days': If the flower isn't watered for two consecutive days, it dies. This means checking for two back-to-back days with no watering.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': If watered on a single day, the flower grows by 1 cm.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': If watered on consecutive days, the flower grows by 5 cm instead of 1 cm.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for checking if the flower dies and updating the height based on the watering pattern should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, while iterating over the days, you should check for consecutive days without water and update the height accordingly in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 1 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered on the only day, but it doesn't die because it requires two consecutive days without water to die. The initial height is 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 2 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 3 1 1 0\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days, growing by 5 cm, and not watered on the third day, so it doesn't grow further.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
