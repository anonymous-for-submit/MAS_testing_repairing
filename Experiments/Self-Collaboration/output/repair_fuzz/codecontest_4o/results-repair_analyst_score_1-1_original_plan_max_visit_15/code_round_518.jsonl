{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

   'imposter' and 'crewmate'\n    Explanation: In the game, an imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters or identify contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This means we need to find the highest count of imposters that can be logically deduced from the comments without contradictions.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This indicates that we are looking for the largest possible number of imposters that can be identified without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to graph traversal and contradiction checking should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to assign roles to players based on comments.\"\n    - \"Check for contradictions during traversal: if a contradiction is found, mark the test case as invalid.\"\n    These steps can be combined in a single traversal process where roles are assigned and contradictions are checked concurrently.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no contradictions, and all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with a single contradictory comment (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, so the output is -1.\n    3. Test case with all players claiming each other as imposters (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 3 imposter, 3 1 imposter) = 2\n       Explanation: A cycle of claims can be resolved with two imposters and one

always tells the truth. Each player can only be one of these roles.\n\n    'contradict'\n    Explanation: A contradiction occurs when the statements made by players cannot logically coexist, indicating an inconsistency in the roles assigned based on the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the highest number of players that can be imposters without causing contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the largest number of imposters possible given the constraints of the comments.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to graph traversal and role assignment should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, during the graph traversal, roles should be assigned, and contradictions should be checked in the same code block. This can be done using a DFS or BFS approach where each node (player) is visited, and roles are assigned based on the comments (edges).\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments: \n    Input: 5 0\n    Expected output: 5\n    Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n\n    Test case with contradictory comments:\n    Input: 2 2\n    1 2 imposter\n    2 1 crewmate\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, as explained in the example.\n\n    Test case with all players claiming others are imposters:\n    Input: 3 3\n    1 2 imposter\n    2 3 imposter\n    3 1 imposter\n    Expected output: 3\n    Explanation: All players can be imposters since each claims another is an imposter, which

concept]\n    'imposter': A player who always lies about the role of other players.\n    'crewmate': A player who always tells the truth about the role of other players.\n    'contradiction': Occurs when statements about roles conflict, making it impossible to assign roles consistently.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': Refers to finding the highest count of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions.\n    Implementation: Use graph traversal to explore all possible role assignments and count imposters.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': Indicates the need to find the highest number of imposters possible.\n    Implementation: During graph traversal, keep track of the number of imposters and update the maximum count found.\n\n# [code

a crewmate always tells the truth. The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on the comments made by players.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This means we need to find the highest count of imposters that can be logically deduced from the comments without contradiction.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This indicates that we are looking for the largest possible number of imposters that can be deduced from the comments.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to graph traversal and role assignment should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to assign roles to each player.\"\n    - \"For each connected component of the graph, try to assign roles such that the comments are consistent.\"\n    These steps can be combined in a single traversal function that assigns roles and checks for contradictions.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, so it's impossible to assign roles without contradiction.\n    3. Test case with all players claiming others are imposters (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 3 imposter, 3 1 imposter) = 2\n       Explanation: A cycle of accusations can be resolved with two imposters and one crewmate.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, particularly for detecting contradictions and handling cases with no comments.\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(n, m, comments):\n        if m == 0:\n            return n\n        #

Specifically, handle cases with no comments by defaulting to all players as imposters.\n    - Implement logic to detect direct contradictions in comments.\n    ```python\n    if m == 0:\n        return n\n    # Implement graph traversal with contradiction detection\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            results.append(n)\n            continue\n        \n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            c = data[index + 2]\n            index += 3\n            \n            graph[i].append((j, c))\n            graph[j].append((i, 'crewmate' if c == 'imposter' else 'imposter'))\n        \n        roles = [-1] * (n + 1)\n        \n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n            roles[start] = 0\n            imposters = 0\n            crewmates = 0\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, role = queue.popleft()\n                if role == 0:\n                    crewmates += 1\n                else:\n                    imposters += 1\n                \n                for neighbor, comment in graph[node]:\n                    expected_role = 0 if comment == 'crewmate' else 1\n                    if roles[neighbor] == -1:\n                        roles[neighbor] = role ^ expected_role\n                        queue.append((neighbor, roles[neighbor]))\n                    elif roles[neighbor] != role ^ expected_role:\n                        return -1\n            \n            return max(imposters, crewmates)\n        \n        max_imposters = 0\n        for player in range(1, n + 1):\n            if roles[player] == -1:\n                result = bfs(player)\n                if result == -1:\n                    max_imposters = -1\n                    break\n                max_imposters += result\n        \n        results.append(max_imposters)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nsolve()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: "}, "Round_1": {"code": "import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            results.append(n)\n            continue\n        \n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            c = data[index + 2]\n            index += 3\n            \n            graph[i].append((j, c))\n            graph[j].append((i, 'crewmate' if c == 'imposter' else 'imposter'))\n        \n        roles = [-1] * (n + 1)\n        \n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n            roles[start] = 0\n            imposters = 0\n            crewmates = 0\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, role = queue.popleft()\n                if role == 0:\n                    crewmates += 1\n                else:\n                    imposters += 1\n                \n                for neighbor, comment in graph[node]:\n                    expected_role = 0 if comment == 'crewmate' else 1\n                    if roles[neighbor] == -1:\n                        roles[neighbor] = role ^ expected_role\n                        queue.append((neighbor, roles[neighbor]))\n                    elif roles[neighbor] != role ^ expected_role:\n                        return -1\n            \n            return max(imposters, crewmates)\n        \n        max_imposters = 0\n        for player in range(1, n + 1):\n            if roles[player] == -1:\n                result = bfs(player)\n                if result == -1:\n                    max_imposters = -1\n                    break\n                max_imposters += result\n        \n        results.append(max_imposters)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nsolve()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 1, "round": 518, "prompt": "Theofanis began participating in the new online game called \"Among them\".
