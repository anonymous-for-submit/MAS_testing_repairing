{"name": "1580_C. Train Maintenance", "description": "Kawasiro Nitori is excellent in engineering. Thus she has been appointed to help maintain trains.\n\nThere are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment. In the beginning, there are no trains, at each of the following m days, one train will be added, or one train will be removed. When a train of model i is added at day t, it works for x_i days (day t inclusive), then it is in maintenance for y_i days, then in work for x_i days again, and so on until it is removed.\n\nIn order to make management easier, Nitori wants you to help her calculate how many trains are in maintenance in each day.\n\nOn a day a train is removed, it is not counted as in maintenance.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i,y_i (1 \u2264 x_i,y_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers op, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, op = 1 or op = 2). If op=1, it means this day's a train of model k is added, otherwise the train of model k is removed. It is guaranteed that when a train of model x is added, there is no train of the same model in the department, and when a train of model x is removed, there is such a train in the department.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines, The i-th of these lines contains one integers, denoting the number of trains in maintenance in the i-th day.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4\n10 15\n12 10\n1 1\n1 3\n1 1\n2 1\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n1 1\n10000000 100000000\n998244353 1\n2 1\n1 2\n1 5\n2 5\n1 5\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first example:\n\nThe first day: Nitori adds a train of model 3. Only a train of model 3 is running and no train is in maintenance.\n\nThe second day: Nitori adds a train of model 1. A train of model 1 is running and a train of model 3 is in maintenance.\n\nThe third day: Nitori removes a train of model 1. The situation is the same as the first day.\n\nThe fourth day: Nitori removes a train of model 3.

There are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment, and initially there are no trains, and at each of the following m days, one train will be added or one train will be removed. When a train of model i is added at day t, it works for x_i days (day t inclusive), then it is in maintenance for y_i days, then in work for x_i days again, and so on until it is removed. In order to make management easier, Nitori wants you to help her calculate how many trains are in maintenance in each day. On a day a train is removed, it is not counted as in maintenance.

The task is to calculate how many trains are in this state each day.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'at most one train of each model': This means that there can be zero or one train of each model at any given time.\n    'works for x_i days': This indicates the train operates for a specific number of days.\n    'maintenance for y_i days': This indicates the train is in maintenance for a specific number of days.\n    Implementation: Use a cycle counter to track the days a train is working and in maintenance.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for updating the state of train models based on daily operations and calculating the number of trains in maintenance should be considered simultaneously. This involves checking the current state of each train model and updating it based on the operation (add or remove) while also counting the number of trains in maintenance.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1\n           1 1\n           1 1\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: On the first day, a train is added and it starts working immediately, so no train is in maintenance.\n\n    Input: 1 2\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           2 1\n    Output: 0\n            0\n    Explanation: On the first day, a train is added and it starts working.

On the second day, a train of model 2 is added and starts working.

This involves checking the current state of each train model and updating it based on the operation (add or remove) while also counting the number of trains in maintenance.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Input: 1 1\n           1 1\n           1 1\n    Output: 0\n    Explanation: On the first day, a train is added and it starts working immediately, so no train is in maintenance.\n\n    Input: 1 2\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           2 1\n    Output: 0\n            0\n    Explanation: On the first day, a train is added and it starts working. On the second day, the train is removed, so no train is in maintenance.\n\n    Input: 2 3\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           1 1\n           1 2\n           2 1\n    Output: 0\n            0\n            0\n    Explanation: On the first day, a train of model 1 is added and starts working. On the second day, a train of model 2 is added and starts working. On the third day, the train of model 1 is removed, so no train is in maintenance.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Code for handling the edge case:\n    ```python\n    def handle_edge_cases(n, m, train_models, operations):\n        # Initialize state tracking for each train", "Round_0": {"code": "def calculate_maintenance_days(n, m, train_models, operations):\n    # Initialize the state of each train model\n    train_state = [None] * (n + 1)  # None means no train of that model is present\n    maintenance_count = [0] * m\n\n    for day in range(m):\n        op, k = operations[day]\n        \n        if op == 1:  # Add train of model k\n            x, y = train_models[k - 1]\n            train_state[k] = (0, x, y)  # (current day in cycle, x days working, y days maintenance)\n        \n        elif op == 2:  # Remove train of model k\n            train_state[k] = None\n        \n        # Calculate maintenance count for the current day\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if train_state[i] is not None:\n                current_day, x, y = train_state[i]\n                cycle_length = x + y\n                if current_day >= x:  # In maintenance period\n                    count += 1\n                # Update the cycle day\n                train_state[i] = ((current_day + 1) % cycle_length, x, y)\n        \n        maintenance_count[day] = count\n    \n    return maintenance_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    m = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    train_models = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        x_i = int(data[index])\n        y_i = int(data[index + 1])\n        train_models.append((x_i, y_i))\n        index += 2\n    \n    operations = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        op = int(data[index])\n        k = int(data[index + 1])\n        operations.append((op, k))\n        index += 2\n    \n    maintenance_count = calculate_maintenance_days(n, m, train_models, operations)\n    \n    for count in maintenance_count:\n        print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: unexpected EOF while parsing (<string>, line 96)"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def calculate_maintenance_days(n, m, train_models, operations):\n    # Initialize the state of each train model\n    train_state = [None] * (n + 1)  # None means no train of that model is present\n    maintenance_count = [0] * m\n\n    for day in range(m):\n        op, k = operations[day]\n        \n        if op == 1:  # Add train of model k\n            x, y = train_models[k - 1]\n            train_state[k] = (0, x, y)  # (current day in cycle, x days working, y days maintenance)\n        \n        elif op == 2:  # Remove train of model k\n            train_state[k] = None\n        \n        # Calculate maintenance count for the current day\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if train_state[i] is not None:\n                current_day, x, y = train_state[i]\n                cycle_length = x + y\n                if current_day >= x:  # In maintenance period\n                    count += 1\n                # Update the cycle day\n                train_state[i] = ((current_day + 1) % cycle_length, x, y)\n        \n        maintenance_count[day] = count\n    \n    return maintenance_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    m = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    train_models = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        x_i = int(data[index])\n        y_i = int(data[index + 1])\n        train_models.append((x_i, y_i))\n        index += 2\n    \n    operations = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        op = int(data[index])\n        k = int(data[index + 1])\n        operations.append((op, k))\n        index += 2\n    \n    maintenance_count = calculate_maintenance_days(n, m, train_models, operations)\n    \n    for count in maintenance_count:\n        print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 63, "prompt": "Kawasiro Nitori is excellent in engineering, thus she has been appointed to help maintain trains.\n\nThere are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment.
