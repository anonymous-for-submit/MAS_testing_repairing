{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

Comments made by players about others being imposters or crewmates are used to deduce the maximum number of imposters or to identify contradictions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number of imposters'\n    Explanation: This refers to finding the highest count of players that can be imposters based on the given comments without contradictions. In code, this would involve calculating the maximum number of nodes (players) that can be labeled as imposters in a consistent graph.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This indicates the need to find the largest possible value, which in this case is the number of imposters. In code, this can be implemented by iterating through possible configurations and keeping track of the highest valid count.\n\n# [code logic]\n    Steps 3 and 4 should be considered simultaneously.\n    \"Detect contradictions in the comments\" and \"Calculate the maximum number of imposters\" should be implemented together because while traversing the graph to check for contradictions, we can simultaneously calculate the number of imposters.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no contradictions, so all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, so the output should be -1.\n    3. Test case with all players being crewmates (e.g., 1 2 crewmate, 2 3 crewmate, 3 1 crewmate) = 0\n       Explanation: If all players are crewmates, no imposters can exist, so the output should be 0.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    - For no comments, simply return n as the number of imposters.\n    - For contradictory comments, detect cycles in the graph with conflicting labels.\n    - For all crewmates, ensure the graph traversal correctly identifies no imposters.\n\n```python\ndef handle_edge_cases(n, m, comments):\n    if m ==

the problem, 'imposter' and 'crewmate' are labels used to describe the relationship between players based on comments. An 'imposter' is someone who is lying, while a 'crewmate' is someone who is telling the truth. The goal is to determine the maximum number of imposters possible without contradictions.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that we need to find the largest count of imposters that can be consistent with the given comments. In code, this involves calculating the maximum number of nodes that can be labeled as 'imposter' without contradictions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to find the largest possible number of imposters. This involves ensuring that the graph coloring (imposter/crewmate) is done in a way that maximizes the count of imposters while maintaining consistency.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to color the graph with two colors representing 'imposter' and 'crewmate'.\"\n    - \"If a contradiction is detected during traversal, mark the test case as inconsistent.\"\n    These steps can be implemented in a single traversal function that checks for contradictions while attempting to color the graph.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: If there are no comments, all players can be imposters since there are no contradictions.\n    \n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, so the output should be -1.\n    \n    Test case with all players being crewmates (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 crewmate\", \"2 3 crewmate\", \"1 3 crewmate\") = 0\n    Explanation: If all comments indicate crewmates, then no imposters can be present.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to handle cases with no comments and contradictory comments:\n    ```python",

The goal is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on these comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This phrase indicates that the task is to find the largest number of players that can be classified as imposters without contradictions in the comments.

In code, this involves ensuring that the graph traversal finds the largest consistent labeling of nodes as 'imposter'.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously.
