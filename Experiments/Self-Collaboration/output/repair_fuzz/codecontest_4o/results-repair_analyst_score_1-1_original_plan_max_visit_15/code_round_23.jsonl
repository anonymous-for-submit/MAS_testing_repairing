For a tree with k levels, it has 2^k - 1 nodes.\n\n    'Rubik's cube colors'\n    Explanation: The problem involves coloring the nodes of the tree using the six colors of a Rubik's cube, with specific constraints on which colors can be adjacent.\n\n    'good coloring'\n    Explanation: A coloring is considered good if all edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides on a Rubik's cube, following the given constraints.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2^k - 1': This describes the number of nodes in the perfect binary tree. In code, this can be implemented using the expression `2**k - 1`.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to calculating the number of valid colorings should be implemented simultaneously, especially when applying the color constraints and using dynamic programming or memoization to store intermediate results. This involves:\n    - Developing a function to calculate valid colorings.\n    - Using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n    - Applying color constraints at each node.\n\n# [edge case] \n    k = 1 = 6\n    Explanation: With only one node, each of the six colors can be used, resulting in 6 valid colorings.\n\n    k = 2 = 30\n    Explanation: For a tree with two levels, each of the 6 colors can be used for the root, and each child can have 5 valid colors (since they can't be the same as the parent), resulting in 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 valid colorings.\n\n    k = 60 = (large number modulo 10^9+7)\n    Explanation: For a large k, the number of valid colorings will be very large, and the result should be computed modulo 10^9+7.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, especially for large values of k.\n    - Implement a function to calculate the number of valid colorings using dynamic programming or memoization.\n    - Apply modulo 10^9+7 at each step to handle large numbers.\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_color", "Round_0": {"code": "MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_good_colorings(k):\n    # Define the number of colors\n    num_colors = 6\n    \n    # Define the adjacency constraints for each color\n    # Each color can be adjacent to 4 other colors\n    adjacency_constraints = {\n        'white': 4,\n        'yellow': 4,\n        'green': 4,\n        'blue': 4,\n        'red': 4,\n        'orange': 4\n    }\n    \n    # Calculate the number of nodes in the perfect binary tree\n    num_nodes = (1 << k) - 1  # 2^k - 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp arrays\n    # dp[i] will store the number of valid colorings for a subtree of height i\n    dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n    \n    # Base case: For a single node (height 1), each color can be used\n    dp[1] = num_colors\n    \n    # Fill the dp array for each level\n    for i in range(2, k + 1):\n        # For each level, calculate the number of valid colorings\n        # Each node can be colored in num_colors ways\n        # Each child can be colored in 4 ways (due to adjacency constraints)\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * (adjacency_constraints['white'] ** 2)) % MOD\n    \n    # The result for the whole tree is the number of valid colorings for the root\n    result = dp[k]\n    \n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    k = int(input().strip())\n    result = count_good_colorings(k)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 2, "round": 23, "prompt": "It is the easy version of the problem.

In this tree, vertices from 2^{k - 1} to 2^k - 1 don't have any children.
