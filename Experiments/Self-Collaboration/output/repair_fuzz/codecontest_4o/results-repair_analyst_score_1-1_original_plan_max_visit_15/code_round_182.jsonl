{"name": "1575_J. Jeopardy of Dropped Balls", "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \u00d7 m\n\nEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n  * a_{x,y}=1 \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); \n  * a_{x,y}=2 \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); \n  * a_{x,y}=3 \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). \n\n\n\nEvery time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) columns.\n\nDetermine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\u2026,a_{i,m} (1 \u2264 a_{i,j} \u2264 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} \u2260 3 and a_{i, m} \u2260 1.\n\nThe next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_k (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput k integers \u2014 the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2 2 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2 2\n1 3\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 2 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.\n\n<image>\n\nThe second and third balls will drop as follows. \n\n<image>\n\nAll balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.", "tags": ["binary search", "brute force", "dsu", "implementation"], "difficulty": 16, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 3\n1 2 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2

The ball is an object that moves through the grid based on the direction specified in each cell. The direction is indicated by integers (1 for right, 2 for down, 3 for left).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 m': This indicates that the starting column for each ball is within the bounds of the grid's width.\n    '1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000': This specifies the maximum size of the grid.\n    '1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5': This indicates the maximum number of balls that can be dropped.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps for simulating the movement of each ball and determining the exit column should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the simulation of the ball's movement through the grid and updating the grid cell direction should occur in a single loop for each ball.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Grid with only one row: If the grid is 1xN, the ball will only move left or right and exit immediately.\n       Example: \n       Input: \n       1 3 1\n       1 3 1\n       2\n       Output: \n       3\n       Explanation: The ball starts at column 2, moves right, and exits at column 3.\n\n    2. Grid with only one column: If the grid is Nx1, the ball will only move down and exit at the bottom.\n       Example: \n       Input: \n       3 1 1\n       2\n       2\n       2\n       1\n       Output: \n       1\n       Explanation: The ball starts at column 1, moves down, and exits at the bottom.\n\n    3. All cells direct the ball to the right: If all cells in a row direct the ball to the right, the ball will exit at the last column.\n       Example: \n       Input: \n       2 3 1\n       1 1 1\n       2 2 2\n       1\n       Output: \n       3\n       Explanation: The ball starts at column 1, moves right through all cells, and exits at column 3.\n\n# [", "Round_0": {"code": "def dropping_balls():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    n = int(data[index])\n    m = int(data[index + 1])\n    k = int(data[index + 2])\n    index += 3\n    \n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append([int(data[index + j]) for j in range(m)])\n        index += m\n    \n    ball_starts = [int(data[index + i]) -
