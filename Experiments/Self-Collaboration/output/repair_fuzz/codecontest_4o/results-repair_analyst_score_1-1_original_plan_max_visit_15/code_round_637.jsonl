{"name": "1591_A. Life of a Flower", "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.\n\nThe flower grows as follows: \n\n  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. \n  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. \n  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a single integer k \u2014 the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n3\n0 1 1\n4\n1 0 0 1\n1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n7\n-1\n1", "tags": ["implementation"], "difficulty": 7, "id": 1591, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3\n1 0

In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive elements in the list are 0.\n    'grows by 1 centimeter': This indicates the flower grows by 1 cm if watered on a single day. In code, this can be implemented by incrementing the height by 1 when a 1 is encountered.\n    'grows by 5 centimeters': This indicates the flower grows by 5 cm if watered on consecutive days. In code, this can be implemented by checking if two consecutive elements are 1 and incrementing the height by 5.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to updating the flower's height based on watering patterns should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, checking for consecutive days without watering and updating the height based on the rules should be handled in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case] \n    Test case: 1\n    Input: 1 0\n    Expected output: 1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered, but since it's only one day, it doesn't die. The height remains 1 cm.\n\n    Test case: 2\n    Input: 2 0 0\n    Expected output: -1\n    Explanation: The flower is not watered for two consecutive days, so it dies.\n\n    Test case: 3\n    Input: 3 1 1 0\n    Expected output: 6\n    Explanation: The flower is watered on the first two days, growing by 5 cm, and not watered on the third day, so it doesn't grow further.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
