{"name": "1594_E1. Rubik's Cube Coloring (easy version)", "description": "It is the easy version of the problem. The difference is that in this version, there are no nodes with already chosen colors.\n\nTheofanis is starving, and he wants to eat his favorite food, sheftalia.

You want to color its vertices with the 6 Rubik's cube colors (White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow).\n\nLet's call a coloring good when all edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides in the Rubik's cube.\n\n<image>| <image>  \n---|---  \nA picture of Rubik's cube and its 2D map.\n\nMore formally: \n\n  * a white node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; \n  * a yellow node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; \n  * a green node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; \n  * a blue node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; \n  * a red node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; \n  * an orange node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; \n\n\n\nYou want to calculate the number of the good colorings of the binary tree.

In this problem, the tree has 2^k - 1 nodes.\n\n    'Rubik's cube colors'\n    Explanation: The problem involves coloring the nodes of the tree using the six colors of a Rubik's cube, with specific constraints on which colors can be adjacent.\n\n    'good coloring'\n    Explanation: A coloring is considered good if all edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides on a Rubik's cube, following specific adjacency rules.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    '2^k - 1': This describes the number of nodes in the perfect binary tree. It is a mathematical expression that can be implemented in code using the `**` operator for exponentiation.\n    'modulo 10^9+7': This indicates that the result should be computed modulo 10^9+7 to handle large numbers.
