{"name": "1582_C. Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf", "description": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a palindrome, if it is possible, and -1, if it is impossible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n8\nabcaacab\n6\nxyzxyz\n4\nabba\n8\nrprarlap\n10\nkhyyhhyhky\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n-1\n0\n3\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first and last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome. You can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a string 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its occurrences to get a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, you don't have to erase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.", "tags": ["brute

asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.\n\nGrandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher. But to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right. It should also be the same from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not. Assume n is sufficiently large such that a solution always exists if possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 2 \u22c5 t lines contain the description of test cases.

If the string is already a palindrome, we can immediately return 0 without further processing.\n\n# [edge case]\n    abcaacab = 2\n    Explanation: By removing the first and last 'a', the string becomes 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome.\n    xyzxyz = -1\n    Explanation: No single character can be removed to make the string a palindrome.\n    abba = 0\n    Explanation: The string is already a palindrome, so no deletions are needed.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases where the string is already a palindrome or when no single character can be removed to make it a palindrome.\n    ```python\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    def min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n        if is_palindrome(s):\n            return 0\n        unique_chars = set(s)\n        min_deletions = float('inf')\n        for char in unique_chars:\n            # Logic to calculate deletions for each character\n            deletions = calculate_deletions(s, char)\n            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\n        return min_deletions if min_deletions != float('inf') else -1\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_chars = set(s)\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in unique_chars:\n        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n        deletions = 0\n        while left < right:\n            if s[left] == s[right]:\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n            elif s[left] == char:\n                left += 1\n                deletions += 1\n            elif s[right] == char:\n                right -= 1\n                deletions += 1\n            else:\n                deletions = float('inf')\n                break\n        \n        min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\n    \n    return min_deletions if min_deletions != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        result = min_deletions_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'input_data'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_deletions_to_palindrome(s):\n    if is_palindrome(s):\n        return 0\n    \n    unique_chars = set(s)\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\n    \n    for char in unique_chars:\n        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n        deletions = 0\n        while left < right:\n            if s[left] == s[right]:\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n            elif s[left] == char:\n                left += 1\n                deletions += 1\n            elif s[right] == char:\n                right -= 1\n                deletions += 1\n            else:\n                deletions = float('inf')\n                break\n        \n        min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\n    \n    return min_deletions if min_deletions != float('inf') else -1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        s = data[index]\n        index += 1\n        \n        result = min_deletions_to_palindrome(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: Code Test Passed."}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 9, "round": 165, "prompt": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
