Odd-indexed means positions 1, 3, 5, etc., while even-indexed means positions 2, 4, 6, etc. In code, this can be implemented by checking the index modulo 2 (i.e., `index % 2 == 0` for even and `index % 2 != 0` for odd).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to the custom comparison function should be implemented simultaneously.

This means that for any two strings, the comparison is made character by character, and the order is determined based on the index of the differing character.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'odd-indexed', 'even-indexed'\n    Explanation: These phrases refer to the positions of characters in the strings. Odd-indexed means positions 1, 3, 5, etc., while even-indexed means positions 2, 4, 6, etc. In code, this can be implemented by checking the index modulo 2 (i.e., `index % 2 == 0` for even and `index % 2 != 0` for odd).\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan related to the custom comparison function should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, the steps:\n    - \"Define a function that takes two strings and compares them character by character.\"\n    - \"For each character position, determine if it is odd or even.\"\n    - \"If the position is odd, compare the characters in ascending order.\"\n    - \"If the position is even, compare the characters in descending order.\"\n    These steps should be combined into a single function that handles the character-by-character comparison based on the index.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1. Input: 1 1 \\n A\n       Output: 1\n       Explanation: With only one book, the order remains the same.\n    2. Input: 2 2 \\n AA \\n AB\n       Output: 1 2\n       Explanation: The first differing character is at position 2 (even), and 'A' comes after 'B' in descending order.\n    3. Input: 3 3 \\n ABC \\n ACB \\n BAC\n       Output: 1 3 2\n       Explanation: The first differing character for ABC and ACB is at position 2 (even), and 'B' comes after 'C'. For ABC and BAC, the first differing character is at position 1 (odd), and 'A' comes before 'B'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases.
