{"name": "1580_A. Portal", "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \u00d7 m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.\n\nA rectangle M size of a \u00d7 b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * a \u2265 5,b \u2265 4. \n  * For all 1 < x < a, blocks M_{x,1} and M_{x,b} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1 < x < b, blocks M_{1,x} and M_{a,x} are obsidian blocks. \n  * For all 1<x<a,1<y<b, block M_{x,y} is an empty block. \n  * M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b} can be any type. \n\nNote that the there must be a rows and b columns, not b rows and a columns.\n\nNote that corners can be any type\n\nCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (t \u2265 1), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (5 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 400). \n\nThen n lines follow, each line contains m characters 0 or 1. If the j-th character of i-th line is 0, block A_{i,j} is an empty block. Otherwise, block A_{i,j} is an obsidian block.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 400.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput t answers, and each answer in a line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1000\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n9

In code, this means iterating over possible sub-rectangles with these minimum dimensions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'minimum'\n    Explanation: The goal is to find the least number of operations required to transform a sub-rectangle into a portal. In code, this involves keeping track of the smallest number of changes needed across all possible sub-rectangles.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan are mostly sequential, but within the subproblem of determining the number of operations required to transform each sub-rectangle into a portal, the steps of checking border conditions and counting changes should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done in a single loop over the sub-rectangle's border.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. A rectangle that is already a portal (e.g., a 5x4 rectangle with the correct configuration) = 0\n    Explanation: No changes are needed if the sub-rectangle already meets the portal conditions.\n\n    2. A rectangle with all blocks as obsidian (e.g., a 5x4 rectangle filled with '1's) = 12\n    Explanation: The maximum number of changes needed to convert all inner blocks to empty and ensure the border conditions.\n\n    3. A rectangle with all blocks as empty (e.g., a 5x4 rectangle filled with '0's) = 12\n    Explanation: The maximum number of changes needed to convert the border blocks to obsidian while keeping the inner blocks empty.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of iterating over all possible sub-rectangles and calculating the number of changes needed will naturally handle these cases by considering all configurations.\n\nNO", "Round_0": {"code": "def min_operations_to_portal(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for n, m, grid in test_cases:\n        min_operations = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of sub-rectangles\n        for i in range(n -
