{"name": "1594_D. The Number of Imposters", "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\" (the most common name in Cyprus).\n\nIn each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThe players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.\n\nAn imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).\n\nNote that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or crewmate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

Description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a comment made by the players of the structure \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n; i \u2260 j; c is either imposter or crewmate).\n\nThere can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate. Contradiction.\n\n-------\nImportant Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output.

who always tells the truth about the role of other players.\n    'contradict': A situation where the comments made by players cannot logically coexist, indicating an inconsistency in the roles assigned.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number': This indicates that we need to find the highest count of imposters that can be assigned without causing contradictions.\n    'distinct integers': Ensures that the players involved in each comment are different, i.e., i \u2260 j.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum': Refers to the largest number of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph construction and role assignment should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically, constructing the graph and traversing it to assign roles should be done in a single code block using a graph traversal algorithm like DFS or BFS.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, making it impossible to assign roles consistently.\n    Test case with all players claiming others are imposters (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 imposter\", \"2 3 imposter\", \"3 1 imposter\") = 3\n    Explanation: All players can be imposters since each claims another is an imposter, which is consistent.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases, particularly to detect contradictions.\n    ```python\n    def detect_contradiction(graph):\n        # Implement a graph traversal to detect contradictions\n        # If a contradiction is found, return True, else return False\n        pass\n\n    def calculate_maximum_imposters(graph):\n        # Implement logic to calculate the maximum number of imposters\n        pass\n\n    # Main logic\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        graph = construct_graph(test_case)\n        if

always tells the truth. The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on the comments made by players.\n\n    'contradict'\n    Explanation: A contradiction occurs when the comments made by players cannot logically coexist, meaning the statements about roles conflict with each other.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This means we need to find the highest count of imposters that can be logically assigned based on the comments without causing contradictions.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: This indicates that we are looking for the largest possible number of imposters that can be assigned without contradictions.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph traversal and role assignment should be implemented simultaneously. Specifically:\n    - \"Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS or BFS) to attempt to assign roles to each player.\"\n    - \"For each connected component of the graph, try to assign roles such that the comments are consistent.\"\n    These steps can be combined into a single traversal function that assigns roles and checks for contradictions.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with no comments (e.g., n = 5, m = 0) = 5\n       Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    2. Test case with a single contradictory comment (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 1 crewmate) = -1\n       Explanation: The comments directly contradict each other, so the output should be -1.\n    3. Test case with all players claiming each other as imposters (e.g., 1 2 imposter, 2 3 imposter, 3 1 imposter) = 3\n       Explanation: All players can be imposters since each claim supports the others being imposters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to handle cases where:\n    - There are no comments, allowing all players to be imposters.\n    - Contradictory comments are detected during graph traversal.\n    Example code for handling contradictions:\n    ```python\n    def detect_contradictions(graph):\n        #

The task is to determine the maximum number of imposters based on the comments made by players, or identify contradictions in the comments.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'maximum possible number'\n    Explanation: This means we need to find the highest number of players that can be imposters without contradicting the comments. In code, this involves finding the largest subset of players that can be imposters given the constraints.\n\n# [degree adverb]\n    'maximum'\n    Explanation: We need to find the largest possible number of imposters. This involves maximizing the count of imposters while ensuring no contradictions in the comments. In code, this can be implemented by exploring all possible role assignments and selecting the one with the most imposters.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps related to graph traversal and contradiction detection should be implemented simultaneously.\n    \"Perform a graph traversal to assign roles to players, checking for contradictions.\"\n    This can be done using a single traversal method (e.g., BFS or DFS) where roles are assigned and contradictions are checked in one pass.\n\n# [edge case]\n    Test case with no comments (e.g., 5 0) = 5\n    Explanation: With no comments, there are no constraints, so all players can be imposters.\n    \n    Test case with contradictory comments (e.g., 2 2 with comments \"1 2 imposter\" and \"2 1 crewmate\") = -1\n    Explanation: The comments contradict each other, so it's impossible to assign roles without conflict.\n    \n    Test case with all players claiming others are imposters (e.g., 3 3 with comments \"1 2 imposter\", \"2 3 imposter\", \"3 1 imposter\") = 3\n    Explanation: Since all players claim others are imposters, all can be imposters without contradiction.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    Specifically, we need to handle cases with no comments and cases with contradictory comments.\n    ```python\n    if m == 0:\n        print(n)\n    elif contradiction_detected:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        # Code to calculate maximum imposters\n    ```\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            results.append(n)\n            continue\n        \n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            c = data[index + 2]\n            index += 3\n            \n            graph[i].append((j, c))\n            graph[j].append((i, 'crewmate' if c == 'imposter' else 'imposter'))\n        \n        roles = [-1] * (n + 1)\n        contradiction_detected = False\n        \n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([start])\n            roles[start] = 0\n            count = [0, 0]  # count[0] for crewmates, count[1] for imposters\n            \n            while queue:\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                current_role = roles[node]\n                count[current_role] += 1\n                \n                for neighbor, comment in graph[node]:\n                    expected_role = 0 if comment == 'crewmate' else 1\n                    if roles[neighbor] == -1:\n                        roles[neighbor] = 1 -

An imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth.
