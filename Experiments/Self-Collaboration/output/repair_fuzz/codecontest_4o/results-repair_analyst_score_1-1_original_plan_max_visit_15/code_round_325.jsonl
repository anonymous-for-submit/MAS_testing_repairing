{"name": "1607_E. Robot on the Board 1", "description": "The robot is located on a checkered rectangular board of size n \u00d7 m (n rows, m columns). The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m from left to right.\n\nThe robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side.\n\nThe sequence of commands s executed by the robot is given. Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 \u00d7 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge. If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\n<image> The robot starts from cell (2, 1) (second row, first column). It moves right, right, down, left, up, and up. In this case it ends in the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' \u2014 the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n) and c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 m), separated by a space \u2014 the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4

The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and the goal is to determine the starting position that allows the robot to execute the maximum number of commands without falling off the board.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'as many commands as possible': This means maximizing the number of commands executed without the robot falling off the board. In code, this involves iterating over possible starting positions and tracking the number of commands executed for each.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    'maximum': This refers to the highest number of commands that can be executed from a starting position without the robot falling off the board. In code, this involves comparing the number of executed commands for different starting positions and selecting the highest.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Iterate over all possible starting cells on the board\" and \"Simulate the robot's movement according to the command sequence\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by using nested loops to iterate over each cell and simulate the movement for each starting position in one block of code.\n\n# [edge case] \n    1 1\n    L\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: The board is 1x1, so any command will cause the robot to fall off immediately. The only starting position is (1, 1), and no commands can be executed successfully.\n\n    2 2\n    UUDD\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: The robot can start at (1, 1) and execute the first 'U' command, but the second 'U' will cause it to fall off. Starting at (1, 1) allows the execution of the maximum number of commands (1).\n\n    3 3\n    RRR\n    = 1 1\n    Explanation: Starting at (1, 1), the robot can execute the first two 'R' commands, but the third 'R' will cause it to fall off. Starting at (1, 1) allows the execution of the maximum number of commands (2).\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We need extra code to handle the edge cases.\n    The code should include boundary checks to ensure the robot does not move outside the board.

Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U'. Each of these commands works in a specific way to alter the robot's position on the board.
