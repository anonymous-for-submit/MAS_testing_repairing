{"name": "1622_E. Math Test", "description": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he gets p_j points (otherwise, he gets 0 points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 (m(m+1))/(2)), where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.\n\nThis is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \u2208 \\{0, 1\\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print m integers \u2014 a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n4 3\n5 1 2 2\n110\n100\n101\n100\n4 4\n6 2 0 10\n1001\n0010\n0110\n0101\n3 6\n20 3

In code, this involves comparing the surprise values of all permutations and selecting the largest one.\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps \"Generate all permutations of the points array from 1 to m\" and \"Calculate the actual points each student would receive based on their answers\" should be implemented simultaneously. This can be done by iterating through each permutation and calculating the actual points in the same loop.\n\n# [edge case]\n    1. Test case with n = 1, m = 1, x = [0], s = [\"0\"] = [1]\n       Explanation: With only one question and the student expecting 0 points, the permutation [1] maximizes the surprise value.\n    2. Test case with n = 1, m = 1, x = [1], s = [\"1\"] = [1]\n       Explanation: With only one question and the student expecting 1 point, the permutation [1] is the only option and matches the expectation.\n    3. Test case with n = 2, m = 2, x = [0, 0], s = [\"00\", \"00\"] = [2, 1]\n       Explanation: Both students expect 0 points, and no questions are answered correctly. The permutation [2, 1] maximizes the surprise value.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of generating permutations and calculating surprise values will naturally handle these cases.\n\nYES", "Round_0": {"code": "import sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, permutation):\n    surprise_value = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        actual_points = sum(permutation[j] for j in range(m) if answers[i][j] == '1')\n        surprise_value += abs(expected_points[i] - actual_points)\n    return surprise_value\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        expected_points = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        answers = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            answers.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of points from 1 to m\n        max_surprise_value = -1\n        best_permutation = None\n        \n        for perm in permutations(range(1, m + 1)):\n            surprise_value = calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, perm)\n            if surprise_value > max_surprise_value:\n                max_surprise_value = surprise_value\n                best_permutation = perm\n        \n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, best_permutation)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n", "report": "The compilation output of the preceding code is: calculate_surprise_value() missing 5 required positional arguments: 'n', 'm', 'expected_points', 'answers', and 'permutation'"}, "Round_1": {"code": "import sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, permutation):\n    surprise_value = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        actual_points = sum(permutation[j] for j in range(m) if answers[i][j] == '1')\n        surprise_value += abs(expected_points[i] - actual_points)\n    return surprise_value\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        expected_points = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        \n        answers = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            answers.append(data[index])\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of points from 1 to m\n        max_surprise_value = -1\n        best_permutation = None\n        \n        for perm in permutations(range(1, m + 1)):\n            surprise_value = calculate_surprise_value(n, m, expected_points, answers, perm)\n            if surprise_value > max_surprise_value:\n                max_surprise_value = surprise_value\n                best_permutation = perm\n        \n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, best_permutation)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n"}}], "scores": [], "pass_results": [true, true, false, false, false, true, true, false, true, true], "pass_test_cases_num": [], "passed": true, "pass": true, "pass_num": 6, "round": 707, "prompt": "Petya is a math teacher. n of his students has written a test consisting of m questions, and for each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.\n\nIf the student answers the j-th question correctly, he earns p_j points (otherwise, he scores 0 points), where the points for the questions are arranged so that the array p is a reshuffling of numbers from 1 to m.\n\nFor the i-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get x_i points for the test and wonders how unexpected the results could be, believing that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to \u2211_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|, where r_i is the number of points that the i-th student has got for the test.\n\nYour task is to help Petya find such a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible.
