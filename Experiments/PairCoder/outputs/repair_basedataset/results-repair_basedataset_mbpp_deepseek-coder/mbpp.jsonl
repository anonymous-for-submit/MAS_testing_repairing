The idea is to set the least significant bit (which is at an even position) and then recursively process the rest of the number. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n1. Define a helper function that takes the number and the current bit position as arguments.\n2. If the current bit position is even, set this bit to 1 and recursively process the rest of the number with the next even position.\n3.

The base case is that every single character is a palindrome of length 1. Then we fill the table for substrings of length 2 to n (where n is the length of the string). The transition is based on whether the characters at the start and end of the current substring are the same and whether the longest palindrome within the substring (excluding the start and end characters) can be extended by these characters.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Initialize a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][i] = 1 for all i. This is because any single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n2. Fill the table for substrings of length 2 to n. For a substring of length l starting at index i, the end index would be i+l-1.\n3. If the characters at the start and end are the same, then dp[i][i+l-1] = dp[i+1][i+l-2] + 2.\n4. Otherwise, dp[i][i+l-1] = max(dp[i+1][i+l-1], dp[i][i+l-2]).\n5. The result will be in dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the string.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are covered, including empty strings and strings with no palindromic subsequences.\n\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'palindrome': A string that reads the same backward as forward.\n    Explanation: In the requirement, we need to find the longest subsequence within a string that is a palindrome.
