The number of pairs with one odd and one even number is the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Count the number of odd and even numbers in the list.\n2. Calculate the number of pairs by multiplying the count of odd numbers by the count of even numbers.\n3. Return the calculated number of pairs.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Empty list: The function should return 0 since there are no pairs.\n- List with a single element: The function should return 0 since there are no pairs.\n- List with all even numbers or all odd numbers: The function should return 0 since there are no pairs with one even and one odd number.\n\n", "- name: \nEfficient Counting Solution\n\n- content: \nA more efficient approach involves counting the number of odd and even numbers in the list first. Then, the number of pairs with an odd XOR value can be calculated using combinatorial mathematics. Specifically, if there are m odd numbers and n even numbers, the number of pairs with an odd XOR value is m * n.\n\n```python\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    odd_count = 0\n    even_count = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    return odd_count * even_count\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the brute force approach. It also handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with all elements having the same parity.\n\n"], "passed": true, "pass_num": 5}

Repeat this process until only prime numbers remain.\n  5. Return the list of all lucid numbers found.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function will return an empty list if the input is 1 or less. It will handle other edge cases by ensuring valid inputs are processed correctly.\n\n"], "passed": true, "pass_num": 1}

The `filter` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator with items for which the function returns true. This approach is also straightforward and handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases.\n\n```python\ndef split(numbers):\n    return list(filter(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, numbers))\n\n# Test cases\nassert split([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]\nassert split([10, 15, 20, 25]) == [10, 20]\nassert split([]) == []\n```\n\n", "- name: \nBrute Force Filtering\n\n- content: \nThe function will iterate through the list of numbers and check if each number is even. If a number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it will be added to a new list. This new list will be returned as the result.\n\n**Implementation:**\n```python\ndef find_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_numbers.append(num)\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Test case\nassert find_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are handled correctly. It checks each number in the list for evenness and collects the even numbers in a new list, which is then returned.\n\n"], "passed": true, "pass_num": 10}

Initialize a DP table with the same dimensions as the input matrix, filled with zeros.\n  2. Set `dp[0][0]` to the cost of the initial cell since it's the starting point.\n  3. Fill the first row and the first column of the DP table with the running sum of costs to ensure that we can only move right or down.\n  4. For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the maximum average by considering both possible paths (right or down) and update the DP table accordingly.\n  5. The maximum average of all paths will be in `dp[N-1][N-1]` where `N` is the size of the matrix.\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - Handle matrices with a single cell by returning the cost itself.\n  - Handle matrices with all cells having the same cost by returning that cost as the average.\n- **Complexity**:\n  - Time: O(N^2) where N is the size of the matrix.

Recursive binary search is a clean and elegant way to solve this problem.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. Define a helper function that takes three parameters: `arr`, `target`, and `bounds`, where `bounds` is a tuple representing the current search space (start index and end index).\n2. In the helper function:\n   - If the start index is greater than the end index, return -1.\n   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n   - If the element at `mid` is equal to the target number and either `mid` is 0 or the element at `mid - 1` is not equal to the target number, return `mid`.\n   - If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to the target number, recursively search in the left half (from `bounds[0]` to `mid - 1`).\n   - Otherwise, recursively search in the right half (from `mid + 1` to `bounds[1]`).\n3.

The idea is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half and compare the middle element with the target number.

If the middle element is equal to the target, we check if it's the first occurrence by looking at the previous element. If the previous element is not equal to the target, we return the current index; otherwise, we continue searching in the left half.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:\n   - Calculate the middle index.\n   - If the element at the middle index is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to `middle - 1`.\n   - If the element at the middle index is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to `middle + 1`.\n   - If the element at the middle index is equal to the target, check if it's the first occurrence by verifying if it's either the first element or not equal to the previous element.
