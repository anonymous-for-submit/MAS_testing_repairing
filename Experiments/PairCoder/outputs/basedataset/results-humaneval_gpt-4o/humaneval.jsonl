Here's how it can be applied to find a zero of the polynomial:\n1. Define a function `newtons_method(xs, x0, tol=1e-7, max_iter=1000)` where `xs` are the polynomial coefficients, `x0` is the initial guess for the root, `tol` is the tolerance level, and `max_iter` is the maximum number of iterations.\n2. Compute the derivative of the polynomial using `derivative(xs)`, which gives a new list of coefficients for the derivative polynomial.\n3. Set `x = x0`.\n4. For each iteration up to `max_iter`:\n   - Evaluate `f(x) = poly(xs, x)` and its derivative `f_prime(x) = poly(derivative(xs), x)`.\n   - Compute the next approximation: `x_next = x - f(x) / f_prime(x)`.\n   - If the absolute difference between `x_next` and `x` is less than `tol`, return `x_next`.\n   - Set `x = x_next`.\n5. If no root is found within `max_iter`, raise an exception or return None.\nThis method requires a good initial guess and may not converge for all polynomials.\n\n", "- name: \nNewton-Raphson Method for Finding Polynomial Root\n\n- content: \nThe Newton-Raphson method is an efficient iterative technique for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function. For polynomials with well-defined derivatives, it can quickly converge to a root:\n1. Define the polynomial function using the given coefficients and compute its derivative.\n2. Choose an initial guess x0 based on some heuristic or prior knowledge.\n3. Apply the Newton-Raphson iteration: x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0).\n4. Check if the value of f(x1) is sufficiently close to zero. If yes, x1 is the root; otherwise, repeat the iteration using x1 as the new guess.\n5. Continue iterating until convergence is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n", "- name: \nUse Newton-Raphson Method for Root Finding\n\n- content: \nImplement the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. This iterative method uses tangent lines to approximate roots, which can be faster than bisection for well-behaved functions.\nSteps:\n1. Choose an initial guess x0 for the root.\n2. Define a derivative function for the polynomial using finite differences or symbolic differentiation.\n3. Iteratively apply the formula: x1 = x0 - poly(x0) / derivative(x0).\n4. Check convergence by comparing the absolute difference between successive guesses and a tolerance level.\n5. Return the last guess once it converges sufficiently close to zero.\nEdge cases include handling non-convergence due to poor initial guesses or flat tangents.\n\n"], "passed": false, "pass_num": 0}
