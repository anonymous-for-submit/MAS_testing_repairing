The steps are as follows:\n1. Import the `re` module to use regular expressions.\n2. Define a regex pattern that matches words ending in \"ly\". A pattern like `\\b\\w+ly\\b` should work, where `\\b` denotes a word boundary and `\\w+` matches one or more word characters.\n3. Use the `re.search` function to find the first match of this pattern in the input sentence.\n4. If a match is found, extract the starting and ending positions using the match's `start()` and `end()` methods, and the matched word using `group()`.\n5.

Define a helper function that processes a single element by checking if it's even or if it's a tuple.\n2. For each element in the input tuple:\n   - Use `filter` to include only even integers.\n   - For tuples, apply `map` combined with a recursive call to process nested tuples.\n3. Filter out any empty tuples from the results to maintain structure integrity.\n4. Construct and return a new tuple from these filtered and mapped results.\nThis solution leverages Python's functional programming tools to apply transformations efficiently across potentially complex nested structures.\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'nested mixed tuple'\n    Explanation: This refers to a tuple that can contain both integers and other tuples, which may themselves contain integers or further nested tuples.\n\n    'remove uneven elements'\n    Explanation: This means to filter out all odd integers from the tuple, including those within any nested tuples.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps involving filtering even integers and processing nested tuples should be implemented simultaneously.

The recursive logic of filtering even numbers and processing nested tuples inherently handles these cases.", "- name: \nIterative Approach with Stack\n\n- content: \nThis solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to handle nested structures. It processes elements without recursion.\n- Initialize a stack with the input tuple and an empty list `result` to construct the final tuple.\n- While the stack is not empty, pop an element from it:\n  - If the element is an integer and even, append it to `result`.\n  - If the element is a tuple, push each item of the tuple onto the stack for further processing.\n- Construct the final tuple from `result` ensuring nested structure is maintained. This might involve keeping track of indices for reconstructing nested tuples.\nThis approach avoids recursion depth limitations and handles uneven numbers by processing each level iteratively.\n\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'uneven elements'\n    Explanation: In the requirement, \"uneven elements\" refers to odd numbers within the nested mixed tuple structure that need to be removed.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The plan suggests using an iterative approach with a stack to handle nested structures.
