The basic idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum sum subarray seen so far. Since the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider the overlap between the subarrays.\n\n1. Calculate the maximum subarray sum for a single instance of the array.\n2. Use this sum to find the maximum subarray sum for `k` repetitions.\n3. To handle the overlap, we can use a modified version of Kadane's algorithm that considers the sum of the entire array as a potential candidate for the maximum sum.\n4.

The steps are:\n1. Import the reduce function and the operator module.\n2. Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers.\n3. Use reduce to multiply all numbers in the set together.\n4. Return the final product.\nThis solution ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are handled correctly.\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n # [core concept]\n    'unique numbers': means that each number in the list should only be counted once, even if it appears multiple times in the list.\n    'product': means the result of multiplying numbers together.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps 2-4 should be implement simultaneously.\n    \"Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers.\"\n    \"Use reduce to multiply all numbers in the set together.\"\n    This could be done by first converting the list to a set to remove duplicates, then using the reduce function from the functools module to multiply all the numbers together.\n\n# [edge case] \n    unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]) = 720000000\n    Explanation: The function first converts the list to a set, which removes the duplicate values, resulting in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}. Then, it calculates the product of these numbers, which is 10 * 20 * 30 * 40 * 50 * 60 = 720000000.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge case.
