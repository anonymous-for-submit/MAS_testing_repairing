Deduce the most likely shift by aligning the most frequent characters in the encoded string to expected common characters like 'e'.\n4.

Since the alphabet wraps around after 'z', we can use modular arithmetic to manage this wrap-around.\n1. Initialize an empty string for the encrypted result.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string:\n   - Find the numeric position of the character using `ord(char) - ord('a')`.\n   - Add 4 to this position to get the new position in the alphabet.\n   - Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around cases, i.e., `(new_position) % 26`.\n   - Convert the numeric position back to a character using `chr(new_position + ord('a'))`.\n   - Append this new character to the result string.\n3. Return the encrypted result string.\n\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'encrypt'\n    Explanation: Encrypting a string involves transforming it in a way that makes it unreadable without a key or method to decrypt it. In this case, the transformation is done by rotating the alphabet.\n\n    'alphabet being rotated'\n    Explanation: This means shifting each letter in the string by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    'two multiplied to two places': means shifting each character by 4 positions in the alphabet (2 * 2 = 4).\n    Implementation: For each character, calculate its new position by adding 4 to its current position and use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around.\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented simultaneously within a loop that processes each character of the string. Specifically, steps 2a-2d should be executed in one code block for each character.\n\n# [edge case] \n    encrypt('z') = 'd'\n    Explanation: 'z' is the last letter of the alphabet, and shifting it by 4 positions results in 'd' due to wrap-around.\n    \n    encrypt('a') = 'e'\n    Explanation: 'a' is the first letter of the alphabet, and shifting it by 4 positions results in 'e'.\n    \n    encrypt('xyz') = 'bcd'\n    Explanation: Each letter is shifted by 4 positions, with wrap-around occurring for 'x', 'y', and 'z'.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The use of modulo 26 in the original logic handles wrap-around cases effectively."], "pass_after_repair": true, "pass_num_after_repair": 1, "round_in_repair": 5}

Iterate through each character in `s0`, adding it to `set0` if it is an alphabetic character.\n3. Repeat step 2 for `s1`, adding alphabetic characters to `set1`.\n4. Compare `set0` and `set1` for equality and return the result.\nThis method ensures case sensitivity is preserved and correctly handles edge cases where strings have no alphabetic characters or different sets of characters.\n\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    'same characters'\n    Explanation: The requirement is to check if two words contain the same set of alphabetic characters, considering case sensitivity and ignoring non-alphabetic characters.\n\n    'case sensitivity'\n    Explanation: This means that the comparison between characters should distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., 'A' is different from 'a').\n\n    'ignore non-alphabetic characters'\n    Explanation: Any character that is not a letter (e.g., numbers, punctuation) should be excluded from the comparison.\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    Steps 2 and 3 should be implemented simultaneously for both strings. This can be done by iterating through each string and adding alphabetic characters to their respective sets in one loop for each string.\n\n# [edge case] \n    same_chars('', '') = True\n    Explanation: Both strings are empty, so they trivially have the same set of characters (none).\n\n    same_chars('123', '456') = True\n    Explanation: Both strings contain only non-alphabetic characters, which are ignored, resulting in empty sets that are equal.\n\n    same_chars('abc', 'ABC') = False\n    Explanation: Due to case sensitivity, 'abc' and 'ABC' are considered different sets of characters.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The original logic of filtering non-alphabetic characters and comparing sets will naturally handle these cases."], "pass_after_repair": false, "pass_num_after_repair": 0, "round_in_repair": 13}
