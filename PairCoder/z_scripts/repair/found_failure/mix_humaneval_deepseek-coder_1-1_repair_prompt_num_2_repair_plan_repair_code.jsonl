For each close parenthesis ')', check if it can match the top of the stack. If it can, pop the stack; if not, push the close parenthesis onto the stack as if it were part of a new sequence.\n5.

Traverse both strings using the pointers and merge them by adding characters from both strings to a new string.\n3. Adjust the balance counter accordingly for each character added.\n4. If at any point the balance counter becomes negative, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening ones up to that point, which makes it impossible to form a balanced string.
