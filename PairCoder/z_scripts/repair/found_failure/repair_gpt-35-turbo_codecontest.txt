Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n × m where each cell contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move, such as 1 for moving to the right or 2 for moving to the bottom.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.

The i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},…,a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} ≠ 3 and a_{i, m} ≠ 1.

The next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, …, c_k (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m) — the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.

Output

Output k integers — the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.

The segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8] is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, resulting in [8, 3, 2]. This shifted segment replaces the original elements of the segment, leading to a final array of a = [1, 8, 3, 2, 5]. Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments, without the need to minimize the number of shifts. Any method requiring n or fewer cyclic shifts will be considered acceptable.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't

It is the easy version of the problem. The key difference is the absence of nodes with pre-selected colors.

Theofanis is hungry and craving his favorite dish, sheftalia. However, he must first complete his homework. Can you assist him with solving this challenge?

You have a perfect binary tree of 2^k - 1 nodes — a binary tree where all vertices i from 1 to 2^{k - 1} - 1 have exactly two children: vertices 2i and 2i + 1. Vertices from 2^{k - 1} to 2^k - 1 don't have any children. You want to color its vertices with the 6 Rubik's cube colors (White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow).

Input

The first and only line contains the integers k (1 ≤ k ≤ 60) — the number of levels in the perfect binary tree you need to color.

Output

Print one integer — the number of the different colorings modulo 10^9+7.

You know on which side the tile has walls by looking at the numbers in their binary form, such as number 10 representing walls on the North and South sides. It is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on its edges. 

You have received data from a Bubble bot. You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. Then in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and each of these numbers can range from 0 to 15. These numbers should be looked at in their binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side. It doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. Your task is to print the size of the rooms from biggest to smallest.

Input

The first line has two numbers which are N and M, the size of the construction. Both are integers:

n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3)

m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3)

Next N x M numbers represent each tile of construction.

Output

Once you finish processing the data your output consists of one line sorted from biggest to smallest room sizes.

Example

Input

4 5 9 14 11 12 13 5 15 11 6 7 5 9 14 9 14 3 2 14 3 14

Find all possible values of k, such that it's possible to make all elements of array a equal to 0 using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter k. It can be proven that exists at least one possible k for any array a. Randomness plays a key role in choosing k which can lead to successful elimination operations.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the length of array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}) — array a itself.

It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200 000.

Output

For each test case, print all values k, such that it's possible to make all elements of a equal to 0 in a finite number of elimination operations with the given parameter k.

Print them in increasing order.

Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. For a given number n, count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes; in other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). He is fascinated by numbers with these properties.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) — the number of test cases, then t lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes.

multi-gen-prompt:
You have an array a[0 … n - 1] consisting solely of ones and zeroes. Unlike other problems, the array indices in this particular case begin at zero.

In one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: 

  1. First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. 

It indicates that the complete array a^{→ d} can be depicted as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$

  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \&  a^{→ d}_i, where \& is a logical "AND" operator. 

For instance, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{→ d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \&  1, 0  \&  0, 1  \&  0, 1  \&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].

The process concludes once the array ceases to change. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes. Assume that the array is modified in place during each step to reflect the latest state.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)

Thus, after identifying the smallest number m in the array a, Yelisey can choose any identical minimum value to remove from the array and subtract from the remaining elements. This process continues until the array's length is reduced by 1 each time. 

Yelisey wants to maximize the minimum value in the array a by applying the minimum extraction operation as many times as needed, ensuring the array's length is greater than 1. What is the maximal value that the minimal element of the array can reach after these operations?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.

In the description of each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the original length of the array a. The second line of the description lists n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array a.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print t lines, each of them containing the answer to the corresponding test case and the answer to the test case is a single integer — the maximal possible minimum in a, which can be obtained by several applications of the described operation.

Yelisey possesses an array a of n integers and can apply a minimum extraction operation by identifying the smallest number m in the array and subtracting it from each remaining element, thus reducing the array length by 1. 

For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, resulting in the array a = [5, 10, 2, 0]. 

What maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several minimum extraction operations to the array to maximize the minimum element?

The i-th room (1 ≤ i ≤ n) has a_i illusion rate, which plays a key role in the energy required to travel between rooms. To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, the energy needed is determined by max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|).

Chanek and Indiana need help in updating the illusion rates of rooms and finding the minimum energy sum to reach the treasure room from an initial room.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ |a_i| ≤ 10^9) — initial illusion rate of each room.

The i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 ≤ s_i, t_i ≤ n). This means there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.

The next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.

Output

For each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.

Given n, find any array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of integers such that all of the following conditions hold:  

  * 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for every i from 1 to n. 

  * a_1 < a_2 < … <a_n and for every i from 2 to n, a_i isn't divisible by a_{i-1} 

An array like this can be formed by utilizing the unique properties of prime numbers, ensuring that each number in the sequence is both increasing and not divisible by its predecessor.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n — the array you found. If there are multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them.

In the third test case, changing the first character 'a' to 'b' yields "bbbb", resulting in \operatorname{AB}(s) = 1 and \operatorname{BA}(s) = 1. This modification helps balance the counts in the fourth test case by replacing the last 'b' with 'a', producing "abbaaa". The key to the task is to analyze each test case meticulously to determine the minimum changes required.

multi-gen-prompt:
Andi and Budi were tasked with organizing their bookshelf containing n books. Every book is identified by its title, specified as a string s_i indexed from 1 to n. The strings all have a length of m. Andi is keen on ordering the books in lexicographical ascending order, whereas Budi prefers lexicographical descending order. To resolve their disagreement, they opted to merge their ideas and arrange it asc-desc-endingly, where characters at odd indices are compared ascendingly, and those at even indices descendingly. A string a is considered to precede a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if at the first differing position between a and b, the following is true: if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Example

Input


5 2

For each student, Petya knows the expected points they should get. Petya is curious about how unpredictable the test results could turn out to be.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) — the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.

On the second line, n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (0 ≤ x_i ≤ (m(m+1))/(2)) are provided, where x_i is the number of points that the i-th student expects to get.

This is followed by n lines, the i-th line contains the string s_i (|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} ∈ \{0, 1\}), where s_{i, j} is 1 if the i-th student has answered the j-th question correctly, and 0 otherwise.

The sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case, print m integers — a permutation p for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

You should be cautious when dealing with situations in which typing a word requires no time, like when each letter of a word appears sequentially on the keyboard. These scenarios require special attention to ensure accuracy and efficiency in coding. 

You should carefully handle scenarios where no time is needed to type the word, such as when each letter in a word consecutively appears on the keyboard in the same order.
