Implement a decoding algorithm to reverse these patterns, adjusting characters as needed.\n4.

A well is an essential resource for water supply and is represented by a row in the grid. Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, and all buckets have the same capacity. Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells, and output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
    Example 1:
            Input: 
                grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
                bucket_capacity : 1
            Output: 6

    Example 2:
            Input: 
                grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
                bucket_capacity : 2
            Output: 5
        
    Example 3:
            Input: 
                grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
                bucket_capacity : 5
            Output: 0

    Constraints:
            * all wells have the same length
            * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
            * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
            * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
            * 1 <= capacity <= 10
