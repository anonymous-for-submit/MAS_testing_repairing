Check if either the lowercase set or uppercase set is empty. If both are non-empty, return False.\n5. If either set is non-empty, check if the other set is empty. If it is, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\n\nPlease read and understand the following inteperation before coding\n# [core concept]\n    \'keys\': Keys in a dictionary are the identifiers associated with their respective values. In this requirement, the core concept is to differentiate between keys based on their case sensitivity (lowercase or uppercase).\n\n# [phrase showing quantity relationship]\n    No phrase showing quantity relationship\n\n# [degree adverb] \n    No degree adverb\n\n# [code logic]\n    The steps in the plan should be implemented sequentially as they involve distinct operations for checking the case sensitivity of keys in the dictionary.\n\n# [edge case] \n    check_dict_case({}) = False\n    Explanation: An empty dictionary should return False as per the requirement.\n    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) = False\n    Explanation: The keys are a mix of lowercase and uppercase, violating the condition, so it should return False.\n    check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) = True\n    Explanation: All keys are either in uppercase, satisfying the condition, so it should return True.\n\n# [extra code for edge case]\n    We do not need extra code to handle the edge cases. The existing logic covers the scenarios effectively.']
