For other cells, `dp[i][j]` can be calculated as `matrix[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`, representing the maximum path sum to reach that cell.\n5. The path count to reach any cell (i, j) is simply `i + j + 1`.\n6.

The idea is to compute the maximum sum of paths to each cell (i, j) in the matrix, while keeping track of the number of cells visited in that path. We then use memoization to avoid recalculating values for cells we've already processed. The average is computed as the path sum divided by the number of cells in the path.\nSteps:\n  1. Create a memoization table where each entry memo[i][j] stores a tuple containing the maximum sum and the number of cells visited to reach cell (i, j).\n  2. Initialize the memo table with the starting point: memo[0][0] = (matrix[0][0], 1), as there's only one way to start.\n  3. Iterate over each cell in the matrix, updating the memo table for each possible move (right or down).\n  4. For each cell (i, j), update memo[i][j] by considering:\n     - Moving right from (i, j-1) if j > 0.\n     - Moving down from (i-1, j) if i > 0.\n  5. For each move, calculate potential new sums and update the memo table if they provide a higher average.\n  6. The final result is memo[N-1][N-1], which contains the maximum sum path ending at the bottom-right corner.\n  7.
