This method is suitable for finding all primes up to a specified integer but is overkill for a single prime check.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n1. Create a boolean array \"prime[0..n]\" and initialize all entries as true. A value in prime[i] will finally be false if i is Not a prime, else true.\n2. Set prime[0] and prime[1] to false as they are not prime numbers.\n3. Iterate from 2 to the square root of n and for every number i, if prime[i] is true, then mark all multiples of i as false starting from i*i (since any smaller multiple of i would have been marked by a smaller number).\n4.

The pattern will match one or more spaces and replace them with either an underscore or a hyphen, depending on the context.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    # Replace sequences of more than two spaces with a hyphen\n    text = re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)\n    # Replace single spaces with underscores\n    return re.sub(r' ', '_', text)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the replacement is done in two steps: first, handle sequences of three or more spaces, and then handle single spaces. It simplifies the logic and reduces the need for manual iteration.\n\n", "- name: \nIterative String Manipulation\n\n- content: \nWe can iterate through the string and build the result by checking for spaces and handling them accordingly. This approach avoids using regular expressions for the main replacement logic, which can be more efficient for simple patterns.\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    result = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char == ' ':\n            result.append('_')\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Condense sequences of more than two underscores to a single hyphen\n    final_result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(result):\n        if result[i] == '_':\n            start = i\n            while i < len(result) and result[i] == '_':\n                i += 1\n            if i - start > 2:  # More than two underscores\n                final_result.append('-')\n            else:\n                final_result.extend(['_'] * (i - start))\n        else:\n            final_result.append(result[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(final_result)\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that spaces are replaced correctly and handles the special case of condensing sequences of more than two underscores into a single hyphen.\n\n", "- name: \nIterative Condensation\n\n- content: \nWe can iterate through the input string and keep track of consecutive spaces. Whenever we encounter more than two consecutive spaces, we replace them with a single hyphen. This approach avoids unnecessary iterations over the result string and is efficient for this problem.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize an empty result string and a counter for consecutive spaces.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a space, increment the counter.\n   - If the character is not a space, append the appropriate characters to the result string based on the counter value.\n   - Reset the counter to zero for non-space characters.\n3. After the iteration, handle any remaining spaces in the counter by appending the appropriate characters to the result string.\n4. Return the modified string.\n\nThis solution ensures that all spaces are replaced and that more than two consecutive spaces are condensed into a single hyphen, handling all edge cases as described.\n", "- name: \nSplit and Join Solution\n\n- content: \nWe can split the input string into words using spaces as the delimiter, then join them back together with underscores. After that, we can use a regular expression to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.\n\nSteps:\n1. Split the input string by spaces.\n2.

Replace all spaces with underscores using the `re.sub` function.\n2. Use `re.sub` again to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\nThis solution is efficient for handling complex space replacements and edge cases, including multiple spaces and leading/trailing spaces.\n\n", "- name: \nRegular Expression Replacement\n\n- content: \nUse the re module to replace spaces with underscores.\n- Use a regular expression to find all spaces and replace them with underscores.\n- Use a second regular expression to find more than two consecutive underscores and replace them with hyphens.\n- Return the modified string.\nThis solution leverages the power of regular expressions for complex replacements.\n\n"], "passed": true, "pass_num": 1}

The sorting will be done using Python's built-in `sorted` function with a custom key.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.\n2. Use the `sorted` function with a key that returns a tuple containing the sum of digits and the index of the number.\n3. Ensure the sorting is stable by using the original index to break ties.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))\n\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum_of_digits(x), nums.index(x)))\n```\n\n**Handling Edge Cases:**\n- Positive and negative numbers.\n- Numbers with leading zeros (handled naturally by converting to string and summing digits).\n- Empty list.\n- Single element list.\n- Multiple elements with the same sum of digits.\n\n"], "passed": false, "pass_num": 0}
