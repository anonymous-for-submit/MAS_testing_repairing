Optimized Encoding and Decoding Plan

- content: 
For an optimized approach, we can use list comprehensions and string manipulation techniques:

1. **Encoding**:
   - Use a list comprehension to split the input string into groups of three characters.
   - For each group of three characters, if the group has exactly three characters, cycle them by moving the first character to the end using slicing.
   - If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged.
   - Concatenate the processed groups to form the encoded string using join.

2. **Decoding**:
   - Use a list comprehension to split the encoded string into groups of three characters.
   - For each group of three characters, if the group has exactly three characters, reverse the cycling by moving the last character to the front using slicing.
   - If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged.
   - Concatenate the processed groups to form the decoded string using join.

This optimized approach leverages Python's efficient list and string operations to achieve better performance, especially for longer strings.

Cyclic Encoding and Decoding Solution Plan

- content: 
The solution plan involves splitting the input string into groups of three characters and then cyclically shifting each group of three characters. For the `encode_cyclic` function, we will:
1. Split the string into groups of three characters.
2. For each group of three characters, cyclically shift the characters by moving the first character to the end.
3. Join the groups back into a single string.

For the `decode_cyclic` function, we will:
1. Split the encoded string into groups of three characters.
2. For each group of three characters, reverse the cyclic shift by moving the last character to the front.
3. Join the groups back into a single string.

This approach ensures that the encoding and decoding processes are inverse operations, returning the original string.



- name: 
Cyclic Encoding Solution Plan

- content: 
The solution approach involves splitting the input string into groups of three characters. If a group has exactly three characters, it cycles them by moving the first character to the end. If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged. The solution uses list comprehension and string manipulation to achieve this.

Steps:
1. Split the input string into groups of three characters using list comprehension.
2. For each group, if it has exactly three characters, cycle them by moving the first character to the end.
3. Join the groups back into a single string and return the result.

This approach ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are handled correctly.



- name: 
Brute Force Encoding and Decoding

- content: 
For simplicity, we can implement a brute force approach:
1. **Encoding**:
   - Iterate through the string in steps of three.
   - For each group of three characters, cycle them and append to the result.
   - If the last group has fewer than three characters, append it as is.
2. **Decoding**:
   - Iterate through the encoded string in steps of three.
   - For each group of three characters, reverse the cycling and append to the result.
   - If the last group has fewer than three characters, append it as is.
This method ensures that we handle all possible valid inputs and edge cases by directly applying the cycling operation without complex data structures or algorithms.

3. If there are fewer than three characters, leave them unchanged.
4. Concatenate the results to form the encoded string.

**decode_cyclic**:
1. Iterate through the encoded string in steps of three.
2. For each step, if there are exactly three characters, reverse the cycle.
3. If there are fewer than three characters, leave them unchanged.
4. Concatenate the results to form the decoded string.

This brute force approach ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are handled correctly, but it may be less efficient than a more optimized approach that leverages Python's list comprehensions and slicing.

Brute Force Encoding Solution

- content: 
This solution involves a brute force approach where we explicitly cycle each group of three characters and handle edge cases such as strings with lengths that are one or two more than multiples of three.

**Solution Approach:**
1. For `encode_cyclic`:
   - Iterate through the string in steps of three.
   - For each group of three characters, cycle them by moving the first character to the end.
   - If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged.
   - Concatenate the groups to form the encoded string.
2. For `decode_cyclic`:
   - Iterate through the encoded string in steps of three.
   - For each group of three characters, reverse the cycling by moving the last character to the front.
   - If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged.
   - Concatenate the groups to form the decoded string.

**Functional Correctness:**
- Handles strings with lengths that are multiples of three.
- Handles strings with lengths that are one or two more than multiples of three.
- Handles empty strings.
- Handles strings with all identical characters.
- Properly encodes and decodes according to the described algorithm.



- name: 
Group Coding Rotation

- content: 
The solution plan involves splitting the input string into groups of three characters. For each group, if the group has exactly three characters, rotate them by moving the first character to the end. If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged. Finally, concatenate all groups to form the encoded string.

For decoding, reverse the process: split the encoded string into groups and for each group of three characters, rotate them back by moving the last character to the front. If a group has fewer than three characters, leave it unchanged.

This solution ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are addressed, including strings of lengths that are not multiples of three.

For the `decode_cyclic` function, the solution approach involves:
1. Iterating through the string in steps of three.

For encoding, we will follow these steps:

2. For each character at position i, i+1, and i+2, swap the positions of characters at i and i+1 if i+1 exists, and optionally swap i+1 and i+2 if i+2 exists.
3. Concatenate the modified characters into a new string and return it.

For decoding, we will reverse the process:
1. Iterate through the encoded string in steps of three.
2. For each character at position i, i+1, and i+2, swap the positions of characters at i and i+1 back to their original positions if possible.
3. Concatenate the modified characters into a new string and return it.

Brute Force Decoding

- content: 
The brute force approach involves trying every possible shift value from 0 to 25 (for the English alphabet) and decoding the string based on each shift. This method ensures that all possible decoded strings are checked until the correct one is found.

**Solution Approach:**
1. Iterate over each possible shift value from 0 to 25.
2. For each shift value, decode the input string by shifting each letter in the string in the opposite direction by the shift value.
3. Check if the decoded string matches the expected output format (e.g., all lowercase or all uppercase letters).
4. Return the decoded string that matches the expected format.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- The function should handle empty strings and strings with only one character.
- The function should correctly handle mixed case letters and non-letter characters.

Brute Force Encoding

- content: 
We will use a brute force approach to encode the string by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet. This can be achieved by iterating through each character in the input string, converting it to its ASCII value, adding 5 to it, and then converting it back to a character. If the character is a letter, we ensure it wraps around the alphabet using modulo arithmetic.

For the `decode_shift` function, we will use a similar approach but subtract 5 from each character's ASCII value to reverse the shift.

This solution assumes all inputs are valid (lowercase alphabetic characters only).



- name: 
Algorithmic Approach using Brute Force

- content: 
The algorithmic approach using brute force involves trying every possible shift value from 0 to 25 (for the English alphabet) to decode the string. This method is impractical for large strings due to its inefficiency but is theoretically possible.

**Implementation**:
- For each possible shift value (0 to 25), decode the string by shifting each character in the encoded string back by the shift value.
- Compare the result with a dictionary of common words or known original strings to find the correct shift value.

**Handling Edge Cases**:
- This approach does not scale well and is not recommended for practical use. It is included here for educational purposes as an example of a brute force method that could be used in certain specific scenarios.


- name: 
Optimized Shift Decoding with Mathematical Insight

- content: 
Instead of brute-forcing all possible shifts, we can use mathematical properties to directly determine the shift used.

**Solution Approach**:
1. Calculate the shift used by comparing the ASCII values of the first character of the input and the encoded string after decoding with a known shift.
2. Use this shift to decode the entire input string.
3. Return the decoded string.

**Functional Correctness**:
- Handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases as per the problem description.
- Ensures that the decoded string matches the original string for any valid shift used during encoding.
- More efficient than brute force for large inputs or a range of possible shifts.



- name: 
Dictionary-Based Encoding

- content: 
To improve readability and maintainability, we can use a dictionary to map each character to its encoded counterpart. The `encode_shift` function will build this dictionary by shifting each character, and the `decode_shift` function will use the reverse mapping.

**Approach**:
- For `encode_shift`, create a dictionary where each key is a character and its value is the character shifted forward by 5 positions.
- For `decode_shift`, create a dictionary where each key is a character shifted forward by 5 positions and its value is the original character.

**Handling Edge Cases**:
- Empty string returns an empty string.
- Non-alphabetic characters are ignored (not encoded/decoded).


- name: 
Algorithmic Optimization

- content: 
To optimize the solution, we can use a more efficient approach that leverages the properties of modular arithmetic. Instead of iterating through each character, we can use a single pass to encode or decode the entire string.

**Solution Approach**:
1. Define the `encode_shift` function to shift each character by 5 positions in the alphabet using modular arithmetic for efficiency.
2. Define the `decode_shift` function similarly, but shift characters backward by 5 positions.
3. Use list comprehensions for concise and efficient implementation of the shifting logic.
4. Ensure that the functions handle all possible valid inputs and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Example Code**:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return """".join([chr((((ord(ch) - ord(""a"") + 5) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return """".join([chr((((ord(ch) - ord(""a"") - 5) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])
```



- name: 
Brute Force Encoding and Decoding with Character Checks

- content: 
We can implement a brute force approach where we check each character to ensure it is a lowercase letter before encoding or decoding. This ensures that the function only processes valid input characters.

For encoding:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    encoded = []
    for ch in s:
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z':
            shifted = chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a""))
            encoded.append(shifted)
        else:
            encoded.append(ch)  # Leave non-lowercase characters unchanged
    return """".join(encoded)
```

For decoding:
```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    decoded = []
    for ch in s:
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z':
            shifted = chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a""))
            decoded.append(shifted)
        else:
            decoded.append(ch)  # Leave non-lowercase characters unchanged
    return """".join(decoded)
```

This solution ensures that the function only processes lowercase alphabetic characters, leaving other characters unchanged. It also handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

The solution involves a brute force approach to shift each character in the string by 5 positions in the alphabet. This can be achieved using a simple loop and character shifting operations.

**Approach**:
1. Iterate through each character in the input string.
2. For each character, calculate its ASCII value.
3. Shift the ASCII value by 5 positions.
4. Wrap around the alphabet if necessary using modulo operation.
5. Convert the shifted ASCII value back to a character.
6. Append the shifted character to the result string.

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty string: Returns an empty string.
- Single character: Shifts the single character by 5 positions.
- Non-alphabetic characters: Not handled by this solution.

- For each character, calculate its ASCII value.
- Shift the ASCII value by 5 positions.
- Wrap around the alphabet if necessary using modulo operation.
- Convert the shifted ASCII value back to a character.
- Join all shifted characters to form the encoded string.

**Solution**:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(""a"") + 5) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):

```



- name: 
Simple Character Shift Encoding

- content: 
**Approach**:
- For each character in the input string, shift its ASCII value by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- Use modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet if necessary.
- Convert the shifted ASCII value back to a character and concatenate all characters to form the encoded string.

**Implementation**:
```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(""a"") + 5) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(""a"") - 5) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])
```

**Correctness**:
- Handles all lowercase alphabetic characters.
- Wraps around the alphabet correctly.
- Returns an empty string for an empty input.
- Does not handle special characters or numbers, as specified in the problem description.



- name: 
Optimal Solution Using Lookup Table

- content: 
This solution uses a lookup table to map each character to its shifted counterpart, making it more efficient than iterating through each character. It also handles edge cases by ensuring that the function only processes lowercase alphabetic characters and wraps around the alphabet if necessary.

**Approach**:
1. Create a lookup table for the alphabet shifted by 5 positions.
2. Map each character in the input string to its corresponding character in the lookup table.
3. Construct the encoded string and return it.

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty string: Returns an empty string.
- Single character: Shifts the single character by 5 positions.
- Characters wrapping around the alphabet: e.g., 'x' becomes 'c', 'y' becomes 'd', etc.

Character Counting

- content: 
Another approach is to count the occurrences of each character in both strings and then compare these counts. This method uses a hash map to count characters efficiently.

1. Create a function to count characters in a string.
2. Count characters in both strings.
3. Compare the character counts from both strings.
4. Return `True` if the counts are identical, otherwise return `False`.

This method also handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases, ensuring functional correctness.

Set Comparison

- content: 
A third approach involves converting the strings to sets of characters and then comparing these sets. This method ensures that we are checking for the presence of each unique character in both strings. Here is the plan:
1. Convert both strings to sets of characters.
2. Compare the sets.
3. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.
This approach is efficient and handles all valid inputs and edge cases by directly comparing the sets of unique characters in each string.


- name: 
Brute Force Comparison

- content: 
The solution approach involves checking each character in one string against every character in the other string. Here are the steps:
1. Iterate through each character in the first string.
2. For each character, check if it exists in the second string.
3. If all characters in the first string exist in the second string, return `True`.
4. If any character in the first string does not exist in the second string, return `False`.
This method ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs and edge cases, including strings with different lengths but the same characters, strings with the same length but different characters, strings with repeated characters, and empty strings. However, this approach is less efficient than the sorting and comparison method and is not recommended for large strings or performance-critical applications.

Using Hash Map for Frequency Count

- content: 
Utilizing a hash map to count character frequencies can simplify the comparison process. Here's the plan:
1. Create a hash map to count characters in the first string.

3. Compare the hash map with the original counts.
4. Return `True` if all counts match, otherwise return `False`.

Character Count Comparison

- content: 
The solution approach involves counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and then comparing the sorted lists of these counts. Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. Count the occurrences of each character in both strings.
2. Convert the counts into sorted lists.
3. Compare the sorted lists. If they are identical, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.
4. Handle edge cases such as empty strings and case sensitivity.

- content: 
**Solution Approach:**
1. Count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. Sort the character frequencies in both strings.
3. Compare the sorted lists of character frequencies.
4. If the sorted lists are identical, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

**Algorithm:**
- Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in each string.
- Sort the dictionary values and compare them.

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle empty strings.
- Handle strings with different lengths.
- Handle strings with special characters and spaces.
- Ensure the function is case-sensitive.

- content: 
**Approach:**
1. Count the occurrences of each character in both strings.
2. Compare the sorted lists of character counts.

**Implementation:**
```python
from collections import Counter

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    return Counter(s0).most_common() == Counter(s1).most_common()
```

**Explanation:**
- `Counter(s0)` and `Counter(s1)` create dictionaries mapping each character to its count.
- `.most_common()` returns a list of tuples sorted by count, with characters as the first element.
- Comparing these lists directly checks if the strings have the same characters with the same counts.

The function will use logarithms to check if \( x \) is a power of \( n \). It will calculate the logarithm of \( x \) base \( n \) and check if the result is an integer.

**Approach:**
1. Calculate the logarithm of \( x \) base \( n \) using the `math.log` function.
2. Check if the result of the logarithm is an integer using the `math.isclose` function to handle floating-point precision issues.
3. If the result is close to an integer, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( x \) is 1, the function should return `true` for any \( n \) because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
- If \( n \) is 1 and \( x \) is not 1, the function should return `false` because any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Logarithmic Check

- content: 
A more efficient approach uses logarithms to determine if \( x \) is a power of \( n \). The idea is to use the property of logarithms that \( k = \log_n(x) \) if and only if \( n^k = x \). This can be computed using the change of base formula.

**Approach:**
1. Compute the logarithm of \( x \) base \( n \).
2. Check if this logarithm is an integer. If it is, then \( x \) is a power of \( n \).
3. Use the `math.log` function to compute the logarithm.
4. Check if the result is an integer using the `math.isclose` function for floating-point precision.

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( x \) is 1, return `true` since any number to the power of 0 is 1.
- If \( n \) is 1, return `false` since any number to the power of 1 is itself.
- If \( x \) is 0 and \( n \) is positive, return `false` since no positive power of a positive number can yield zero.

Recursive Backtracking

- content: 
This approach uses recursion to explore all possible ways to merge the two strings. We start by choosing a character from each string and recursively build the merged string. If at any point the number of close parentheses exceeds the number of open parentheses, we backtrack and try a different choice. This method explores all possible ways to merge the strings and checks if any of them result in a balanced string.

Stack-Based Validation

- content: 
We can use a stack to validate if a concatenated string is balanced. This approach involves pushing open parentheses onto the stack and popping them when a matching close parenthesis is encountered.

Solution Steps:
1. Concatenate the two strings and iterate through the result.
2. Use a stack to keep track of open parentheses. Push onto the stack when encountering an open parenthesis and pop when encountering a close parenthesis if the stack is not empty.
3. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, the string is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

This solution ensures that the balance of parentheses is checked efficiently and correctly for all possible valid inputs and edge cases.


- name: 
Stack Validation

- content: 
The stack-based approach involves using a stack to validate if a concatenated string is balanced. This method is efficient and straightforward for this problem.

For this approach:
1. Concatenate both strings in any order.
2. Use a stack to validate the balance of the parentheses:
   - Push an open parenthesis '(' onto the stack.
   - If a close parenthesis ')' is encountered and the stack is not empty, pop the stack.
   - If the stack is empty when a close parenthesis ')' is encountered, the string is unbalanced.
3. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, the string is balanced, and we return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

This solution ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are covered by using a well-known algorithm for checking balanced parentheses.


- name: 
Brute Force Concatenation

- content: 
We can generate all possible concatenations of the two strings and check if any of them are balanced. This approach involves checking each possible concatenation for balance.

1. Generate all possible concatenations of the two strings.
2. For each concatenation, check if it is balanced using a stack-based approach.
3. Return 'Yes' if a balanced string is found, otherwise return 'No'.

Edge cases to consider:
- Empty strings.
- Strings with no parentheses.
- Strings where one string is balanced and the other is not, but their concatenation is balanced.



- name: 
Stack Validation

- content: 
Using a stack to validate if a concatenated string is balanced is a common approach. This method involves simulating the process of pushing and popping parentheses onto a stack.

Steps:
1. Concatenate the two strings in both possible orders.
2. Use a stack to validate the balance of each concatenated string.
3. If any concatenated string is balanced, return 'Yes'.
4. If none of the concatenated strings are balanced, return 'No'.

This approach ensures that the balance of the parentheses is checked efficiently using a stack, which is well-suited for this purpose.


- name: 
Brute Force Solution

- content: 
We can generate all possible concatenations of the two strings and check if any of them are balanced. This approach involves checking each possible combination, which can be computationally expensive for long strings. However, it will correctly handle all possible inputs, including edge cases.

**Approach:**
1. Generate all possible concatenations of the two strings.
2. For each concatenation, check if it is balanced using a stack-based method.
3. Return 'Yes' if a balanced string is found, otherwise return 'No'.

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty strings.
- Strings with no parentheses.
- Strings where one string is balanced and the other is not.



- name: 
Stack Validation

- content: 
We can use a stack to validate if the concatenated string is balanced. Push each character onto the stack and ensure that when a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, it matches with the last opened parenthesis '('. If the stack is empty at the end, the string is balanced.

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Traverse both strings in sequence and apply the stack rules to each character.
3. If a character is '(', push it onto the stack.
4. If a character is ')', check if there is a corresponding '(' on the stack top. If so, pop the stack.
5. At the end of traversal, if the stack is empty, return 'Yes'.
6. If the stack is not empty, return 'No'.

This solution leverages the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) property to efficiently check for balance in the concatenated string.


- name: 
Greedy Counting

- content: 
We can use a greedy approach to determine if it's possible to concatenate the two strings to form a balanced string. We need to check if the total number of open parentheses in both strings is equal to the total number of close parentheses, and if for every prefix of the concatenated string, the number of open parentheses is not less than the number of close parentheses.

Algorithm:
1. Count the number of open and close parentheses in both strings.
2. Check if the total number of open parentheses equals the total number of close parentheses.
3. Traverse through the concatenated string and keep a counter for the balance of parentheses. Increment the counter for open parentheses and decrement for close parentheses.
4. If at any point the counter goes negative, it means there are more close parentheses than open ones up to that point, which means the string is not balanced.
5. If the counter never goes negative and the total number of open and close parentheses are equal, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

This approach ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are considered.



- name: 
Stack-Based Validation

- content: 
Using a stack data structure can be an effective way to validate if a string of parentheses is balanced. This approach can be extended to check both concatenated strings.

Steps:
1. Initialize a stack for each string.
2. Traverse each string and use the stack to keep track of unmatched parentheses.
3. After processing both strings, check if both stacks are empty or have balanced parentheses.
4. If both stacks are either empty or balanced, return 'Yes'.
5. If either stack is not balanced, return 'No'.

This method ensures that each parenthesis is properly matched and nested, which is crucial for determining if a string is balanced.


- name: 
Stack Validation

- content: 
We can use a stack to validate if any concatenation of the two strings is balanced. This approach involves pushing and popping characters from the stack to ensure balance.

Solution Approach:
1. Consider both possible concatenations of the two strings.
2. Use a stack to validate each concatenation for balance.
3. If any concatenation is balanced, return 'Yes'.
4. If neither concatenation is balanced, return 'No'.

Functional Correctness:
- This approach directly checks for balance using a stack, ensuring that each character is properly nested without having unmatched parentheses. It handles edge cases where strings are unbalanced or contain no parentheses.


- name: 
Brute Force Concatenation

- content: 
We can brute force all possible concatenations of the two strings and check if any of them result in a balanced string. This approach involves generating all possible concatenations and then checking each one for balance.

Solution Approach:
1. Generate all possible concatenations of the two strings.
2. For each concatenation, check if it is balanced using a stack or similar method.
3. Return 'Yes' if any concatenation is balanced, otherwise return 'No'.

To address all possible valid inputs and edge cases:
- Valid inputs: Both strings are balanced, one string is balanced and the other is not, but their concatenation is balanced.
- Edge cases: Empty strings, strings with no parentheses, strings where one string is balanced and the other is not, but their concatenation is balanced.

Using regular expressions can simplify the problem by directly matching the last character's condition.
1. Use a regular expression to match the last character as an alphabetical character not part of a word.
2. Return True if a match is found, otherwise return False.

    text = re.sub(r' ', '_', text)
    text = re.sub(r'_{3,}', '-', text)
    return text

Regular Expression Replacement

- content: 
We can use regular expressions to replace spaces and handle more than two consecutive spaces. Here's the approach:
1. Use `re.sub` to replace single spaces with underscores.
2. Use `re.sub` with a pattern to replace more than two consecutive underscores with a hyphen.
This solution leverages the power of regular expressions to handle the replacements efficiently and correctly.

Simple Replacement and Condensation

- content: 
We can solve this problem by iterating through the string and replacing spaces with underscores. After that, we will iterate through the string again to condense consecutive underscores into a single hyphen.

1. Replace all spaces with underscores.
2. Iterate through the string and condense consecutive underscores into a single hyphen.



- name: 
Regular Expression Replacement

- content: 
We can use regular expressions to replace spaces with underscores and then condense sequences of more than two underscores into a hyphen.

Here's the approach:
1. Replace all single spaces with underscores using the re module.
2. Use a regular expression to find sequences of three or more underscores and replace them with a hyphen.
3. Return the modified string.

This approach ensures that all spaces are handled correctly, including edge cases like leading or trailing spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces.


- name: 
Iterative Replacement Solution

- content: 
We can iterate through the string and replace spaces with underscores. After that, we can iterate again to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == ' ':
            result += '_'
            # Check for consecutive spaces
            count = 1
            while i + 1 < len(text) and text[i + 1] == ' ':
                count += 1
                i += 1
            if count > 2:
                result = result[:-count + 1] + '-'
        else:
            result += text[i]
        i += 1
    return result
```

This solution handles the replacement of spaces and sequences of more than two spaces by iterating through the string and making the necessary replacements.


- name: 
Regular Expression Replacement

- content: 
We can use regular expressions to replace spaces efficiently. The pattern will match one or more spaces and replace them with either an underscore or a hyphen, depending on the context.

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    # Replace sequences of more than two spaces with a hyphen
    text = re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)
    # Replace single spaces with underscores
    return re.sub(r' ', '_', text)
```

This approach ensures that the replacement is done in two steps: first, handle sequences of three or more spaces, and then handle single spaces. It simplifies the logic and reduces the need for manual iteration.



- name: 
Iterative String Manipulation

- content: 
We can iterate through the string and build the result by checking for spaces and handling them accordingly. This approach avoids using regular expressions for the main replacement logic, which can be more efficient for simple patterns.

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = []
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            result.append('_')
        else:
            result.append(char)
    
    # Condense sequences of more than two underscores to a single hyphen
    final_result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(result):
        if result[i] == '_':
            start = i
            while i < len(result) and result[i] == '_':
                i += 1
            if i - start > 2:  # More than two underscores
                final_result.append('-')
            else:
                final_result.extend(['_'] * (i - start))
        else:
            final_result.append(result[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(final_result)
```

This solution ensures that spaces are replaced correctly and handles the special case of condensing sequences of more than two underscores into a single hyphen.



- name: 
Iterative Condensation

- content: 
We can iterate through the input string and keep track of consecutive spaces. Whenever we encounter more than two consecutive spaces, we replace them with a single hyphen. This approach avoids unnecessary iterations over the result string and is efficient for this problem.

Here's the plan:
1. Initialize an empty result string and a counter for consecutive spaces.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is a space, increment the counter.
   - If the character is not a space, append the appropriate characters to the result string based on the counter value.
   - Reset the counter to zero for non-space characters.
3. After the iteration, handle any remaining spaces in the counter by appending the appropriate characters to the result string.
4. Return the modified string.

This solution ensures that all spaces are replaced and that more than two consecutive spaces are condensed into a single hyphen, handling all edge cases as described.


- name: 
Split and Join Solution

- content: 
We can split the input string into words using spaces as the delimiter, then join them back together with underscores. After that, we can use a regular expression to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.

Steps:
1. Split the input string by spaces.
2. Join the split words with underscores.
3. Use a regular expression to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.

Regular Expression Replacement

- content: 
We can use regular expressions to replace spaces with underscores and then replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.

Steps:
1. Replace all spaces with underscores using the `re.sub` function.
2. Use `re.sub` again to replace sequences of more than two underscores with hyphens.
3. Return the modified string.

This solution is efficient for handling complex space replacements and edge cases, including multiple spaces and leading/trailing spaces.

Mathematical Approach

- content: 
An alternative approach is to use mathematical formulas to directly compute the average and then convert it to binary:
1. Check if `n` is greater than `m`. If true, return `-1`.
2. Calculate the sum of the first and last numbers in the range, multiply by the count of numbers in the range, and divide by 2.
3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by the count of numbers in the range.
4. Round the average to the nearest integer.
5. Convert the rounded integer to a binary string.
6. Return the binary string.



- name:

Sorting and Slicing

- content: 
- Sort the array in ascending order.
- Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
- Return the sliced array.
- Handle edge cases such as empty array, `k` being 0, or `k` being greater than the length of the array by directly slicing or returning an empty list.



- name: 
Sorting and Slicing

- content: 
- Sort the array in ascending order.
- Slice the last `k` elements from the sorted array.
- Return the sliced array.
- This approach ensures that the last `k` elements are the maximum `k` numbers in the array.
- The time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the length of the array.
- This solution handles all edge cases, including when `k` is 0 or greater than the length of the array.



- name: 
Heap (Priority Queue)

- content: 
The second approach uses a heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the maximum `k` elements. This method is particularly useful for large arrays due to its time complexity of O(n log k).

**Solution Approach:**
1. Create a min-heap to store the maximum `k` elements.
2. Iterate through the array, and for each element:
   - If the heap size is less than `k`, add the element to the heap.
   - If the heap size is equal to `k` and the current element is greater than the root of the heap, replace the root with the current element and adjust the heap.
3. Convert the heap to a list and sort it in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted list.

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is 0, return an empty list.
- If `k` is greater than the length of the array, return the entire array sorted.
- If the array is empty, return an empty list.

The first approach involves sorting the array and then slicing the last `k` elements. This method is simple and efficient for small arrays. However, for very large arrays, this approach might not be the most optimal due to the sorting step.

**Solution Approach:**
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Slice the last `k` elements from the sorted array.
3. Return the sliced array.

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty array: Returns an empty list.

Sorting with Custom Key

- content: 
A third approach involves using sorting with a custom key that sorts by negative values for negative numbers and by positive values for positive numbers. Here's how to do it:
1. Sort the array using a custom key that treats negative numbers as positive and positive numbers as negative.
2. Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
3. Sort the sliced array in ascending order to get the final result.
4. Return the sorted array.
This method ensures that negative numbers are treated correctly and handles edge cases like all negative or all positive numbers in the array.

Case-Insensitive Prefix Filtering

- content: 
The function will iterate through the list of strings and check if each string starts with the given prefix, ignoring case. To achieve this, we can use a list comprehension to filter the strings. The function will compare the prefix with the start of each string using the `startswith` method, and convert both the prefix and the string to lower case for the comparison.

```python
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.lower().startswith(prefix.lower())]
```

This solution handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases as described in the problem statement:
- An empty list will return an empty list.
- Strings that start with the given prefix, regardless of case, will be included in the output.
- Strings that do not start with the given prefix will be excluded.
- The function is case-insensitive, so 'A' and 'a' prefixes will match both 'apple' and 'Apple'.

Use a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and check if each string starts with the given prefix. If it does, include it in the result list.

```python
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

This solution addresses all possible valid inputs and edge cases:
- An empty list will return an empty list.
- If no strings start with the given prefix, the function will return an empty list.
- The prefix can be an empty string, in which case all strings are returned.
- The input list can contain strings of varying lengths and characters, and the function is case-sensitive.

The solution will use list comprehension to filter the strings that start with the given prefix.

**Approach:**
1. Iterate over each string in the input list.
2. Check if the string starts with the given prefix.
3. Collect the strings that meet the condition into a new list.
4. Return the new list.

**Function Implementation:**
```python
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Empty list: Returns an empty list.
- No strings match the prefix: Returns an empty list.
- Prefix is an empty string: Returns all strings in the list.

List Comprehension

- content: 
We can use list comprehension to filter the strings that start with the given prefix. The approach is to iterate over each string in the input list and check if it starts with the specified prefix. If it does, we include it in the result list. This method is efficient and concise.

**Solution Approach:**
- Iterate over each string in the input list.
- Check if the string starts with the given prefix.
- If it does, include it in the result list.
- Return the result list.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- An empty list returns an empty list.
- If no strings start with the prefix, an empty list is returned.
- The prefix being an empty string returns the entire list.
- Case sensitivity is handled naturally by Python's string comparison.



- name: 
Filter Function Solution

- content: 
We can use the built-in `filter` function to apply a condition to each string in the list and include only those strings that start with the given prefix.

**Approach:**
1. Use the `filter` function to iterate through the input list.
2. Provide a lambda function as the condition to check if a string starts with the given prefix.
3. Convert the filter object to a list and return it.

**Function Implementation:**
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return list(filter(lambda s: s.startswith(prefix), strings))
```

**Testing:**
- For an empty list, the function should return an empty list.
- For a list with strings not starting with the prefix, the function should return an empty list.
- For a list with strings starting with the prefix, the function should return a list containing only those strings.
- If the prefix is an empty string, the function should return the entire input list.

Simple Reversal Check

- content: 
The solution involves reversing the input string and comparing it with the original string. If both are the same, the string is a palindrome.
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):

```



- name: 
Reverse String Comparison

- content: 
The solution involves reversing the string and then comparing it with the original string. This can be achieved using slicing in Python.

Steps:
1. Reverse the input string.
2. Compare the reversed string with the original string.
3. If they are the same, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

This method is simple and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for string manipulation, making it efficient for this problem.



- name: 
Simple Comparison Approach

- content: 
This solution involves comparing characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center.
1. If the string is empty or has a single character, return `True` as it is a palindrome.
2. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string.
3. Compare characters at these pointers. If they are not equal, return `False`.
4. Move the pointers towards the center.
5. If all characters are equal, return `True`.

Compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

**Solution Approach:**
1. Reverse the input string.
2. Compare the reversed string with the original string.
3. Return `True` if they are the same, otherwise return `False`.

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle empty string by returning `True`.



- name: 
Two-Pointer Technique

- content: 
Another approach is to use a two-pointer technique. One pointer starts at the beginning of the string and the other at the end. We move these pointers towards the center, comparing the characters they point to. This method is efficient and avoids the need for extra space or preprocessing.

Here's the implementation:
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    left, right = 0, len(text) - 1
    while left < right:
        while left < right and not text[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not text[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if text[left].lower() != text[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

This solution ensures that we only compare alphanumeric characters and ignores case sensitivity, handling all edge cases effectively.



- name: 
Iterative Comparison

- content: 
- Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and one at the end of the string.
- Move the pointers towards the center, comparing characters.
- If any characters do not match, return `False`.
- If the pointers meet without finding a mismatch, return `True`.
- Handle the edge case of an empty string by returning `True`.



- name: 
Reverse and Compare

- content: 
The solution approach involves reversing the string and comparing it to the original string. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.

Steps:
1. Reverse the input string.
2. Compare the reversed string with the original string.
3. Return `True` if they are the same, otherwise return `False`.

For edge cases, an empty string will return `True` since it reads the same forward and backward.



- name: 
Simple Comparison

- content: 
The solution involves comparing characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center. This can be efficiently done using a loop.

- Convert the string to lowercase (optional, to ensure case-insensitive comparison).
- Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string.
- Move the pointers towards each other, comparing the characters at each step.
- If any characters do not match, return `False`.
- If the pointers meet without finding a mismatch, return `True`.

This approach ensures that all possible valid inputs and edge cases are addressed.

Simple Reversal Check

- content: 
The simplest approach is to reverse the string and compare it with the original string. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome. This can be done using slicing in Python, which is efficient for this purpose.
```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    return text == text[::-1]
```
This solution handles all possible valid inputs and edge cases as described:
- An empty string returns `True`.
- A single character string returns `True`.
- A palindrome string returns `True`.
- A non-palindrome string returns `False`.



- name: 
Two Pointers Technique

- content: 
Using two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string, we can compare characters while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity.

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    cleaned_text = ''.join(char.lower() for char in text if char.isalnum())
    left, right = 0, len(cleaned_text) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if cleaned_text[left] != cleaned_text[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

This solution ensures functional correctness by handling all possible valid inputs and edge cases, including empty strings, strings with spaces and punctuation, and case sensitivity.
